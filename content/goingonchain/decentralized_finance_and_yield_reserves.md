Anchor Protocol is a platform that facilitates peer-to-peer lending and borrowing within the realm of [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | decentralized finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It allows users to deposit funds and earn interest, while others can borrow money using their cryptocurrency as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Anchor Protocol Mechanics

Lenders on Anchor Protocol can [[supplying_assets_for_yield | earn interest]] of up to 19% to 20% on their deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Borrowers, conversely, pay a floating interest rate and receive ANC tokens as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The protocol aims to maintain a high yield for lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The mechanism behind maintaining this high yield involves two key components:

1.  **Borrower Interest**: Borrowers pay an Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on the money they borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, a borrower might pay 21.55% APR on a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **Staking Rewards**: When borrowers secure a loan, they must stake their crypto as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This staked collateral generates a staking reward return, which can be around 5.83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Example of Fund Flow

Consider a scenario where Alice lends $1,000, expecting a 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Bob borrows $1,000, providing $3,000 in bLuna as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   Bob, as the borrower, pays 22% interest on his $1,000 loan, amounting to $220 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The $3,000 collateral staked by Bob generates a staking reward of 5%, which is $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   In total, $370 is collected from Bob ($220 from interest + $150 from staking reward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Out of the collected $370:
*   $200 is paid to Alice, fulfilling her 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   The remaining $170 is directed to the Anchor [[impact_of_yield_reserve_on_interest_rates | yield reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

This mechanism demonstrates the "power of [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | decentralized finance]]" in generating and sustaining yields through a combination of borrowing interest and staking rewards, contributing to a reserve that can stabilize interest payments to lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

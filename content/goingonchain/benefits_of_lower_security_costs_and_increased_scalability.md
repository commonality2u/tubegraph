The Ethereum Merge is being implemented for several key reasons, including the reduction of security costs and the enhancement of scalability for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Lower Security Costs

One primary reason for the Merge is to lower security costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Setting up a Proof of Work (PoW) mining rig is expensive due to hardware costs and uses a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. By transitioning to Proof of Stake (PoS), the cost of achieving consensus is reduced, making it more accessible for individuals to participate as validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

In Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2), validation can be performed using simpler hardware like a Raspberry Pi, provided the validator has 32 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For those without 32 ETH, participation is still possible through pooling options like Lido or Rocket Pool, where users can contribute smaller amounts of ETH for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This shift is expected to result in a 99.9% reduction in network operating costs by decreasing energy and hardware expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Increased Scalability

Another crucial reason for the Merge is to enable greater scalability for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The transition to Proof of Stake facilitates future upgrades such as:

*   **EIP 4844 (Sharding)**: This proposal is central to the sharding implementation, which aims to distribute the network's data and processing load across multiple smaller chains, thereby increasing transaction throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Statelessness**: There are plans to implement statelessness, which would further reduce the amount of data validators need to store and process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

While these future developments are complex, requiring significant technical effort and time to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, the underlying goal is to extend the capabilities of the blockchain. It is more challenging to extend a Proof of Work blockchain compared to a Proof of Stake one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The Merge sets the foundational layer necessary for Ethereum to achieve its long-term scalability goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a platform that allows users to trade tokens [00:00:05]. Examples include PancakeSwap and SushiSwap [00:00:07]. On a DEX, users can also become a [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity provider]] [00:00:13].

## Stakeholders in a DEX

Several parties are involved in the ecosystem of a DEX:

*   **Traders**
    Traders aim to exchange a variety of protocol tokens and seek low slippage and good liquidity [00:00:26]. When a trade occurs, the DEX earns a portion of the trading fees [00:00:34].
*   **Protocols**
    Protocols look for platforms with high liquidity to establish their pools [00:00:37]. They prefer places with more liquidity, similar to why companies might list on the SGX (Singapore Exchange) [00:00:42].
*   **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**
    LPs contribute to meeting the demand for high liquidity by supplying assets to pools [00:00:50]. For example, by providing liquidity for Fight and BUSD, LPs assist the Fight protocol, which benefits from users needing to buy their token to participate in this specific liquidity pool [00:00:58]. This arrangement benefits both the protocol and the DEX by improving liquidity [00:01:03].

## Benefits of Providing Liquidity

LPs gain several advantages for their contribution:

*   **Earning Trading Fees**
    LPs earn a share of the fees generated from trading activities within the pool [00:00:15], [00:01:09].
*   **Additional Incentives**
    LPs may receive additional [[incentive_mechanisms_for_liquidity_providers | incentives]] beyond just trading fees [00:01:11].
*   **Earning DEX Tokens**
    Participants, including LPs and stakers, can earn more DEX tokens through farming or staking [00:01:17], [00:01:29]. For instance, holding CAKE tokens can enable participation in Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs) or yield staking [00:01:21].

## Considerations for DEX Tokens

While liquidity provision offers benefits, the incentives for participants farming DEX tokens may not always be aligned [00:01:36]. During periods of market uncertainty, such as when the market experiences fear, these participants may be inclined to sell off their DEX tokens first [00:01:42]. This behavior can lead to significant price drops, as observed with tokens like CAKE and SUSHI over 90 days during unfavorable market conditions [00:01:48].

Bridging cryptocurrency assets between different blockchain networks often involves various fees and minimum transfer requirements. This article outlines the process and associated costs when bridging UST from Terra to Avalanche (Avax) for farming opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. On Avax, users can find yield opportunities, such as up to 56% APY in a UST-Avax pool or approximately 17% in a stablecoin pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Bridging UST with Satellite

To bridge UST from Terra to Avax, a platform called Satellite can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The process involves selecting Terra as the source chain and UST as the source asset, then specifying Avax as the destination chain and inputting the Avax address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Associated Fees and Minimums

When using Satellite for transfers, there is a transfer fee of 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Additionally, the minimum transfer amount required is 15 UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. After setting up the transfer, users connect their wallet and approve the transaction, which triggers a signature on their MetaMask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Using Keeper Wallet for Transfers

A crucial step in this bridging process requires the use of the Keeper wallet, which is part of the Cosmos ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Users must first move their UST from their Terra Station wallet to their Keeper wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Keeper Wallet Transaction Fee

When sending a transaction via the Keeper wallet, the [[network_fees_associated_with_smart_contract_wallets | network fees]] amount to approximately 0.004 LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. After approving the transaction, it typically takes three to five minutes for the transfer to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Once completed, the UST will appear in the user's MetaMask wallet on the Avax network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, allowing participation in activities like stablecoin farming on platforms such as Pangolin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

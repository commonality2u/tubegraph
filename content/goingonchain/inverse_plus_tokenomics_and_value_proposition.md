Inverse Finance recently upgraded their governance token to "Inverse Plus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This upgrade aims to add more value to the governance token, which traditionally might only be used for voting or not accrue significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Inverse Plus is described as a "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Core Products

Inverse Finance operates with three primary products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:
*   **IMV Token**: The governance token that can be bought and staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Anchor**: A platform for lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **DOLA**: Their stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### DOLA Stablecoin

DOLA offers farming opportunities on both Ethereum (ETH) and Fantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For swapping DOLA, users can utilize Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

Stabilizer is Inverse Finance's proprietary liquidity pool, comprising a DAI and DOLA pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It features a swap fee of approximately 0.4% and guarantees a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The Stabilizer pool has about 4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Anchor Protocol

Anchor is a lending and borrowing platform within the Inverse Finance ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The total value locked (TVL) on Anchor is approximately $65 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Users can deposit assets to earn a base reward and additional rewards APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For example, depositing ETH yields a base reward of 0.08% APY and an IMV token reward of 5.34% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## IMV Token and Inverse Plus Benefits

The IMV token stands out with an APY of 122% when supplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This high yield is because supplying IMV on Anchor also involves staking the IMV at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

When IMV is deposited into Inverse Finance, users receive xIMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Holding xIMV provides several benefits:

1.  **IMV Emission**: Users receive IMV emissions per ETH block, totaling approximately 6,400 times per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   The [[tokenomics_and_team_structure | tokenomics]] for staking IMV to get xIMV has a cap of 500% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This cap can only be changed through a new governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   There is no maximum supply for the IMV token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, if the emission rate becomes too high, the DAO can introduce a cap to cease further minting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

2.  **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

3.  **Voting Rights**: xIMV grants holders [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | voting rights]] within the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The governance page shows active polls, with 35 proposals made and 32 passed, including the recent [[inverse_finance_governance_token_upgrade | Inverse Plus]] proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. All votes are conducted on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

4.  **Collateral for Borrowing DOLA**: A unique and significant feature is the ability to use xIMV as collateral to borrow the DOLA stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This means users can:
    *   Buy IMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Supply IMV (earning 122% IMV emission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   Earn a share of the protocol revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Participate in governance through voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Use the xIMV as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This design enables capital efficiency, as the supplied IMV continues to earn its APY even while a portion is used as collateral for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Funds are not locked, allowing for flexible use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Transparency

Inverse Finance features a transparency tab that provides smart contract links and details on how each contract interacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It also presents financial figures akin to a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

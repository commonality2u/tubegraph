Investing in decentralized exchange (DEX) tokens presents unique challenges, primarily due to misaligned incentives among participants during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## What is a Decentralized Exchange (DEX)?
A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a platform, such as PancakeSwap or SushiSwap, where users can trade cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Users can also become liquidity providers on a DEX to earn a portion of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### [[utilities_of_dex_tokens | Utilities of DEX Tokens]]
Typical [[utilities_of_dex_tokens | utilities of DEX tokens]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>:
*   **Governance Power**: Allowing token holders to participate in the DEX's decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   **Staking for Yield**: Staking the token to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Launchpad Participation**: Access to new token launches (e.g., Initial Farm Offerings or IFOs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## [[stakeholders_in_decentralized_exchanges | Stakeholders in Decentralized Exchanges]]
Understanding the different parties involved in a DEX helps illuminate the challenges of token investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The main [[stakeholders_in_decentralized_exchanges | stakeholders]] include:

*   **Traders**: Seek to trade a variety of protocol tokens with low slippage and good liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. DEXs earn a cut of trading fees from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Protocols**: Look for DEXs with high liquidity to set up their pools, similar to why companies might list on exchanges with more liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**: Contribute capital to pools, helping to create high liquidity for protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. They earn a cut of the fees and additional incentives for providing liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, providing liquidity for BNB and BUSD can be beneficial for the protocol and the DEX by improving liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Stakers**: Acquire DEX tokens either from the open market or by farming them, and then stake these tokens to earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For instance, holding CAKE tokens allows participation in IFOs or staking for yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Stakers can also earn more DEX tokens through their participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Core Challenge: Misaligned Incentives
A significant challenge in [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investing in cryptocurrency]] like DEX tokens stems from the incentives offered to participants like liquidity providers and stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Many of these participants receive DEX tokens as *extrinsic incentives* for their activities, rather than purchasing them from the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

This creates a scenario where, when the broader market experiences fear or a downturn, these participants are likely to be among the first to "dump" or sell their farmed DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This behavior is due to the incentives not being fully aligned with long-term holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Market Impact
The effect of this dynamic is evident in the price charts of major DEX tokens. For example, the prices of CAKE and SUSHI tokens have shown significant declines during periods when the market generally performs poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This makes direct purchasing of DEX tokens less attractive, leading some to prefer farming them instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Evolving Landscape: [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_dex_token_value | Crypto Bribes]]
Despite these challenges, the landscape for DEX tokens is evolving. There's a growing trend where more people are willing to hold DEX tokens due to the emergence of "[[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_dex_token_value | crypto bribes]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This development, which will be explored further in subsequent discussions, may alter the incentive structures and potentially change the holding behavior for DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

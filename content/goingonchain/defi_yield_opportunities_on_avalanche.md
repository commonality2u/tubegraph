Bridging UST to Avalanche (AVAX) opens up various [[defi_strategies_on_avalanche | DeFi strategies]] and [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | yield optimization]] opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Available Yields

On the Avalanche network, users can find attractive yield percentages:
*   **UST-AVAX Pool:** Up to 56 percent [[real_yield_in_defi | real yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, this pool carries the risk of impermanent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Pool:** Approximately 17 percent by parking assets in a stablecoin pool, which helps mitigate impermanent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This offers a [[comparison_of_yield_farming_on_stablecoin_platforms | safer yield farming option]] using [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Bridging UST to Avalanche

To access these opportunities, UST must first be bridged from its native chain (Terra) to Avalanche. This process involves a few steps:

### Using Satellite Software

For better rates, the Satellite software is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
1.  **Select Source:** Choose "Terra" as the source chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> and "UST" as the source asset <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
2.  **Select Destination:** Input "AVAX" as the destination chain and provide your Avalanche address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  **Review Fees and Minimums:**
    *   There is a transfer fee of 0.1 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   The minimum transfer amount is 15 UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Transfer:** Click "connect wallet and transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This will prompt a signature request on your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Clicking "sign" will generate a one-time deposit for the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### The Keeper Wallet Step

This part of the process requires an additional step involving the Keeper wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>:
1.  **Keeper Wallet:** Keeper is a wallet designed for the Cosmos ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Move UST to Keeper:** You must move your UST from your Terra Station wallet over to your Keeper wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
3.  **Enter Transfer Amount:** Once UST is in your Keeper wallet, input the desired amount to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
4.  **Approve Transaction:** Your Keeper wallet will trigger a prompt requiring your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The transaction cost for sending is approximately 0.004 LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
5.  **Confirmation:** After approving, wait approximately three to five minutes for the transaction to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. You can then verify the presence of your UST on your Metamask wallet on the Avalanche network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Participating in Yield Farming on Avalanche

Once your UST is successfully on the Avalanche network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
1.  **Navigate to Pangolin:** Go to the Pangolin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  **Deposit Assets:** Choose the "deposit" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Join Stablecoin Farming:** Participate in the stablecoin farming pool to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

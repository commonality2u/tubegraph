From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a platform like PancakeSwap or SushiSwap where users can trade tokens [00:00:05]. Beyond trading, users can also become [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] to earn a portion of trading fees [00:00:11].

## Typical DEX Token Utilities

DEX tokens generally offer several utilities:
*   **[[voting_incentives_and_their_effects_on_dex_token_prices | Governance Power]]** Users holding DEX tokens can participate in the platform's governance [00:00:16].
*   **Staking for Yield** Tokens can be staked to earn additional yield [00:00:19].
*   **Launchpad Participation** Staking DEX tokens may grant access to launchpad events [00:00:21].

## Stakeholders and Their Role in DEX Token Systems

### Traders and Protocols
[[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Traders]] utilize DEXs to trade a variety of protocol tokens, seeking low slippage and good liquidity [00:00:26]. The DEX earns a cut from these trading fees [00:00:34].

[[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Protocols]], on the other hand, look for DEXs with high liquidity to establish their token pools [00:00:37]. This is comparable to why a company might choose to list on a stock exchange with higher liquidity, like SGX [00:00:42].

### Liquidity Providers and Stakers
[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Liquidity providers]] are crucial for maintaining the high liquidity that [[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | protocols]] desire [00:00:50]. By providing liquidity, such as for 'fight' and BUSD, users can earn additional yield [00:00:53]. This process often requires users to purchase the specific protocol token (e.g., 'fight'), which benefits both the protocol and the DEX by enhancing overall liquidity [00:00:58]. In return, [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] receive a cut of the fees and additional incentives [00:01:09].

[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Stakers]] are another group of participants who either acquire DEX tokens from the open market or farm them, then stake these tokens to earn more yield [00:01:13]. For instance, holding CAKE tokens allows participation in Initial Farm Offerings (IFOs) or staking for yield [00:01:21]. This also enables [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | stakers]] to earn more DEX tokens [00:01:27].

### Challenges with Incentives
Both [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | stakers]] frequently farm DEX tokens through "extensional incentives" rather than direct purchases from the open market [00:01:31]. This alignment of incentives can pose a challenge: when the market experiences a downturn or fear, these participants are often the first to [[challenges_with_holding_dex_tokens | dump their DEX tokens]] [00:01:42]. This behavior can be observed in the price performance of tokens like CAKE and Sushi during periods of market weakness [00:01:48]. For this reason, some avoid buying DEX tokens, preferring to farm them instead, as the incentives historically have not been aligned for holding [00:01:54].

However, the landscape for DEX tokens is evolving, with more individuals showing a willingness to [[challenges_with_holding_dex_tokens | hold DEX tokens]] due to the emergence of [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | crypto bribes]] [00:02:00]. This new development is explored further in Part 2 of the discussion [00:02:07].

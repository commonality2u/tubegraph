[[staking_on_wonderland_time | Wonderland]] is shifting its focus to [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] is the wrapped version of staked TIME (MEMO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It incorporates the price of TIME and all rebases, meaning it includes the interest earned from staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

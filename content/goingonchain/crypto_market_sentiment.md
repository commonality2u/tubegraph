As of the current period, the crypto market is experiencing a "bearish sentiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, leading to significant portfolio declines for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, one investor noted their portfolio was down approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Investment Approach During Bearish Sentiment

Despite the negative [[crypto_market_trends_in_2022|market sentiment]], it is considered an opportune time for accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Investors must be prepared to "stomach the pain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> that comes with market downturns.

Key [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies|strategies]] include:
*   **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)**: Continuously investing in strong projects such as BTC, FTM, and Merit Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This strategy helps avoid "catching the falling knife" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> by averaging out the purchase price.
*   **Project-Specific Strategies**: For assets like Luna, some investors are accumulating using specific strategies like the Anchor Pro strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Short-term Trading**: Some investors engage in short-term trading, such as buying back assets like W Memo after an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session and planning to sell soon after, which is not a long-term commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Holding Belief in Products**: Despite market dynamics, some continue to hold assets like Spell and Ice, believing them to be good products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Underlying Market Conditions

Despite current sentiment, [[crypto_adoption_and_technology|crypto adoption]] continues to grow, and there have been no changes to the underlying [[crypto_adoption_and_technology|technology]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, the crypto market remains highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, emphasizing the importance of investing only what one can afford to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

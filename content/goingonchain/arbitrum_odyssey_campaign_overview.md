The [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum [00:00:45]. Participants can earn NFTs and potentially qualify for future airdrops [00:00:50]. This period is seen as an opportunity due to low gas fees on Arbitrum and the potential for airdrops, which can be considered "free money" [00:00:22].

## Campaign Basics

The [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign officially ends on June 27th at 13:00 Eastern Time, which is June 28th at 1:00 AM Singapore time [00:00:32].

Participants are guaranteed to receive an NFT for bridging during the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] period [00:00:15]. Speculation suggests that collecting these NFTs might be a criterion for a future [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | Arbitrum airdrop]] [00:00:58]. Additionally, some projects involved in the Odyssey do not yet have tokens, leading to speculation that interacting with them could qualify users for airdrops from those specific protocols [00:01:02].

## Week 1: Bridging

The first week of the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is dedicated to bridging [00:01:11]. The primary goal for users is to move Ethereum (ETH) to Arbitrum [00:01:13].

To qualify for the week's NFT, users must utilize a selected list of bridges [00:01:18]. An extra bonus NFT can be obtained by using the bridge that has facilitated the most wallet bridging activity [00:01:26].

Key details for Week 1 bridging:
*   **Asset Counted**: Only ETH is counted for the bridge rate [00:01:40].
*   **Minimum Sum**: There is no minimum amount of ETH required to bridge [00:01:46].
*   **Multiple Bridges**: Users are allowed to use multiple bridges [00:01:48].

Currently, Hop is identified as the leading bridge in terms of wallet activation, followed closely by Celer Network [00:02:50].

## Airdrop Speculation and Strategy

A common strategy for participating in the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] involves using bridges that do not yet have their own tokens [00:02:01]. The reasoning behind this is the speculation that using such bridges might also qualify participants for a separate airdrop from the bridge protocol itself, effectively "killing two birds with one stone" [00:02:04].

Recommended bridges without existing tokens include Lifi, Bungee, and Hashflow [00:02:26]. While gas fees are low, the cost can accumulate if many bridges are used [00:02:21].

When bridging, users should consider both gas fees and slippage [00:04:53]. For example, the bridge may have higher slippage compared to aggregators like Bungee, which aims to provide the highest return by pulling info from various sources [00:03:59].

## Specific Bridge Incentives

Several bridges participating in the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] offer additional incentives beyond the standard NFTs:

*   **Lifi**: Announced that they will be rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details on rewards are not yet fully released [00:03:07].
*   **Hashflow**: Offers a limited edition NFT that winners can redeem for Hashflow tokens at launch [00:03:21]. To qualify, users can swap any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum [00:03:30]. Winning criteria include the top 100 participants by total volume and 100 randomly selected "lucky price burns" [00:03:37].
*   **Bungee**: To qualify for their additional incentive, users must be among the top 1000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction [00:03:54].
*   **Hop**: 10 lucky "hoppers" will receive a small brand NFT as a special gift for bridging with them [00:04:03].

Blur is a new NFT marketplace and aggregator offering various features, including real-time pricing for NFT traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Blur has a confirmed token airdrop, accessible via blur.io/airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Blur Airdrop Phases

Blur's airdrop is divided into two phases: Airdrop 1 and Airdrop 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Airdrop 1
Airdrop 1 was primarily for users who had traded NFTs in the six months prior to its announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The amount received depended on trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Participants received "care packages," which will later convert into Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Legendary care packages contain significantly more Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

The claim period for Airdrop 1 was 14 days from October 19th, suggesting an end around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Airdrop 2
For those who missed Airdrop 1, Airdrop 2 provides another opportunity to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To qualify for Airdrop 2, users must list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize Airdrop 2 Rewards

While there isn't an explicit formula for Airdrop 2, specific actions can help maximize the received Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### 1. [[benefits_of_listing_nfts_on_blur | NFT Listing Activity]]
The primary way to earn Airdrop 2 rewards is by listing NFTs on Blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. To maximize potential rewards:
*   **List More NFTs:** The more NFTs listed, the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **List Blue Chip NFTs:** Prioritize listing blue chip collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **List Active Collections:** Focus on active collections that generate significant trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Blur's listing setup is designed to be user-friendly:
*   Users can choose to list only on Blur or concurrently push listings to LooksRare and OpenSea (X2Y2 was temporarily disabled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Pricing can be easily set at floor price, top trade, or via a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   An auto-adjust feature for fees is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Blur does not charge a marketplace fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### 2. [[incentivized_royalties_on_blur | Incentivized Royalties]]
Blur offers [[incentivized_royalties_on_blur | incentivized royalties]]. While paying royalties is optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, choosing to do so will reward users with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategy aims to encourage more NFT listings on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### 3. Loyalty Points
Every wallet on Blur has a loyalty point system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. To earn high loyalty points:
*   Ensure that if you are listing your NFTs across multiple marketplaces, the lowest price for your NFT is listed on Blur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   High loyalty points increase the odds of receiving "super rare" care packages, which contain a greater quantity of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The Blur tokens are expected to be distributed in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, with the current focus being on collecting care packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

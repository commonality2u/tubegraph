A Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is a platform where users can trade tokens directly, exemplified by platforms like PancakeSwap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These platforms allow users not only to trade but also to become [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems|liquidity providers]] to earn a portion of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Role of Traders

Traders are key stakeholders in a DEX. They seek to trade a diverse range of protocol tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Their primary considerations include:
*   **Low Slippage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Good Liquidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>

When traders execute a trade, the DEX earns a cut of the trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Role of Protocols

Protocols, or projects, represent another vital set of participants in a DEX. They are looking for a platform with high liquidity to set up their token pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This is analogous to a company choosing to list on a major stock exchange like SGX due to its greater liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Protocols desire a high-liquidity environment, which is facilitated by [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems|liquidity providers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

For instance, if a protocol (e.g., "Fight") wants to incentivize more yield, it can encourage users to provide liquidity for its token paired with another asset like BUSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This strategy benefits the protocol by requiring users to buy its token to participate in the liquidity pool, thereby improving liquidity for both the protocol and the DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Interplay and Challenges

The interplay between traders, protocols, and liquidity providers is crucial for a DEX's ecosystem. While traders and protocols drive demand for liquidity, the incentivization of [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems|liquidity providers]] and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems|stakers]] often involves distributing DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Many [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems|stakers]] and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems|liquidity providers]] receive these tokens through farming rather than buying them from the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This can lead to misaligned incentives; during market downturns, these participants might be the first to sell their DEX tokens, impacting token prices like Cake and Sushi, which experienced declines over 90 days when the market was performing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This dynamic explains why some individuals avoid buying DEX tokens, preferring to farm them instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

However, the landscape for holding DEX tokens is evolving, particularly with the emergence of [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens|crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

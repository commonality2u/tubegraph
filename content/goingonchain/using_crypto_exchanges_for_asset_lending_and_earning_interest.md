In times of market volatility and rising interest rates, having crypto assets work harder can help cover expenses like mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms faced issues like halted withdrawals or collapse due to exposure to events like Terra or 3AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Withdrawing assets from these affected services, such as Hodlnaut and Finblox, meant they were no longer earning yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

One strategy to keep assets earning is to park them on crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## How Crypto Exchanges Facilitate Lending

Most crypto exchanges offer services that allow users to lend out their crypto assets in return for interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### KuCoin
On KuCoin, users can lend out their crypto assets with specified terms, such as seven or fourteen days, to earn interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Additionally, KuCoin Earn allows users to park their [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoins]] or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR), with tenure options being flexible or fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### FTX
The FTX app provides a simplified interface for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing assets, without a complex trading interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

*   **Deposits and Transfers**
    *   Transferring ERC-20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX app is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Depositing USDC (an ERC20 token) onto the FTX app is also free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates and Earnings**
    *   FTX offers 8% APY on the first $10,000 of crypto assets, which then drops to 5% for amounts exceeding that limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   The effective APY can be around 6.1% when exceeding the $10,000 limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   Other assets, such as Ethereum, also share the same APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   A user reported earning approximately $72 in interest over a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals**
    *   Without Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, the maximum withdrawal limit is $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals can be made via international wire transfer to a bank account that accepts foreign currency (USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, USDC can be sent to a MetaMask wallet or other crypto wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals from FTX are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Origin of Yield
The yield earned on platforms like FTX can originate from several sources:
*   The platform itself may be lending the assets for margin and internal lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   Assets might be used as a source of liquidity for [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | lending and borrowing]] activities on related platforms, such as FTX Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   The yield could also be a marketing incentive to attract users to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations
It is crucial to understand that using crypto exchanges for asset lending is not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A primary concern is platform risk; if the exchange fails or halts withdrawals, all assets held on the platform could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Prudent risk management, including diversifying assets across different platforms, is advised to mitigate such risks and ensure some assets continue to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

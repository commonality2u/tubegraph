This article provides an update and detailed overview of the [[Hundred Finance mirroring event | Hundred Finance]] protocol, clarifying the distinction between Supply APY and Stake APR, and explaining the mechanics of earning, staking, and managing rewards on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Mechanics: Supply, Stake, and Loan

Hundred Finance offers users the ability to supply crypto assets, stake tokens, and take out loans, each with distinct implications for earning rewards and asset management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Supplying Assets and Earning Supply APY

When you supply a stable or crypto asset to Hundred Finance, you earn a "Supply APY" on that asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. As a receipt for your supplied assets, you receive an "h token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, if you supply MEM, you receive hMEM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

> For instance, supplying 500 MEM to Hundred Finance will only yield the Supply APY (e.g., 0.27%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Staking H Tokens and Earning Stake APR

To earn the "Stake APR" on HND tokens, you must stake your h tokens (the receipt tokens received from supplying assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The staking option is accessible by selecting "stake" and choosing to stake your hMEM or other h tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

> [!warning] Staking Limitation
> Once you stake your h tokens, you will no longer be able to take a loan against your supplied assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Taking a Loan

If your primary objective is to take a loan, you should only supply assets and then take a loan; you should not stake your h tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> For example, if you supply 500 MEM and want to take a loan for SPELL, you would select SPELL and borrow up to your limit (e.g., 50% of your limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If you were to then stake half of your hMEM, your supply value and corresponding borrow limit would drop by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## HND Rewards and veHND

HND tokens are earned as rewards on Hundred Finance, primarily through staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Collecting HND Rewards

To withdraw your earned HND rewards, navigate to the HND section on the platform and select "collect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This dashboard also provides an overview of your supply APR and staking APR for HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Locking HND for veHND

You can lock up your HND tokens to earn "veHND" (vote-escrowed HND), which provides additional rewards and governance power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The amount of veHND you receive depends on the lock-up duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:

*   **4 years**: 100 HND locked yields 100 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **2 years**: 100 HND locked yields 50 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

If you add more HND to an existing lock-up, it will follow the previously committed lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Uses of veHND

veHND serves two primary functions:

1.  **Voting for Pool Rewards**: You can use veHND to vote on different pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Pools with more votes receive a higher average APR on HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
2.  **Boosting Personal Rewards**: veHND allows you to boost your own HND rewards from staking, potentially up to 2.5 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the required veHND for maximum boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

> [!info] Voting Cycle
> You can vote with your veHND every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Reward calculations and voting outcomes are applied at the end of each "epoch," the timing of which is displayed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

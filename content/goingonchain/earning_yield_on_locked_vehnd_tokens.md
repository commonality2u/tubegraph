On the [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]] protocol, users can enhance their yield by locking HND tokens to obtain veHND (or mveHND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This locked form of HND grants voting power that can be used to boost the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) on specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## How Locking HND Boosts Yield

When you [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | stake assets to earn yield]] on [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]], the yield is typically earned in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. To increase this yield, you can convert your HND tokens into mveHND by locking them up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

This mveHND allows you to:
*   **Vote for specific pools** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Boost the APR** on the chosen pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

For example, to achieve an 86% APR on a FRAX pool, you would need to lock enough HND tokens to attain the maximum boost of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Locking 300 HND for four years could provide a 1.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, while increasing the locked amount to 1000 HND could achieve the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This mechanism provides a direct benefit for [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | locking HND for additional benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Cross-Chain Mirroring of veHND

A significant development on [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]] is the introduction of a mirroring event for locked veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This feature allows users to take their locked veHND from one chain, such as Fantom, and mirror it over to another chain, like Polygon, or any other chain supported by [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

This mirroring capability means that users do not need to perform separate lockups on different chains to boost yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Instead, the existing locked veHND can be utilized across chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Process of Mirroring veHND
1.  Navigate to the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
2.  Select the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired destination chain where the veHND will be mirrored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
4.  Click "Mirror" and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

[[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]] leverages LayerZero services to facilitate this cross-chain mirroring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon, though not all mirroring directions may be active yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

This feature provides a strong incentive for users to engage with [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]] across multiple chains, as it allows them to immediately [[using_vehnd_for_boosting_rewards | use veHND for boosting rewards]] without additional lockups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. For example, veHND locked on Fantom can be mirrored to Polygon to boost APRs on pools there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

Llama Swap is a product developed by DefiLlama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. It is presented as a method to avoid additional fees, such as the 0.15% swap fee implemented by Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Key Features and Advantages

### Aggregator of Aggregators
Llama Swap functions as an aggregator that includes other aggregators like [[using_aggregators_like_1inch_and_c_swap | 1inch]] and [[using_aggregators_like_1inch_and_c_swap | C Swap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>. By combining these, it aims to provide competitive rates for token swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

### No Fees
One of the primary benefits of using Llama Swap is that it charges no fees for swaps made through its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. This contrasts with platforms like Uniswap, which impose a swap fee for using their user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Privacy Feature
Llama Swap also offers a privacy feature that allows users to hide their IP address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

### Example Swap Rate
For instance, when looking to sell one Ethereum (ETH), Llama Swap could provide a rate of 1575 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>.

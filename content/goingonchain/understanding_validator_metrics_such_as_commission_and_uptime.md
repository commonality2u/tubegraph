Staking LUNA allows holders to earn more LUNA and receive airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. To stake LUNA, users can navigate to the "Staking" section within their Terra wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This section displays a list of validators, typically sorted by uptime by default, but can also be sorted by commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. There are typically over 100 validators available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Key Validator Metrics

When [[choosing_validators_for_luna_staking | selecting a validator]], several key metrics should be considered:

### Commission
Commission refers to the percentage of your staking rewards that the validator takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Ideally, users should look for validators with a 0% commission to maximize their rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Uptime
Uptime indicates how consistently the validator is operating. A validator's uptime should be as close to 100% as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. If a validator is not functioning, stakers will not earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Voting Power
Voting power represents the influence a validator has within the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to avoid centralizing power at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, individual preferences, such as interest in specific airdrops (e.g., Orion airdrop), might lead someone to partially stake with a higher-ranked validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Self-Delegation
Self-delegation is the amount of LUNA that the validator themselves has staked with their own node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher self-delegation amount indicates that the validator has more "skin in the game," demonstrating their commitment to the network's health and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Staking and Claiming Rewards

Once a validator is chosen, users can select the amount of LUNA they wish to delegate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. After delegating, a summary of the delegated amount and earned LUNA rewards will be visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In addition to LUNA rewards, stakers can also receive special airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

To collect airdrops, users can visit Terra Smart Stake (terrasmartstake.io), input their Terra address, and check for unclaimed airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If eligible, they can then claim their available airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Inverse Finance is a platform that has recently upgraded its governance token to **Inverse Plus** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The objective behind this upgrade is to add value to the governance token, differentiating it from others that may not accrue value or are solely used for voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Inverse Plus is designed as a "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Key Products

Inverse Finance operates primarily through three main products:
*   The IMV token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   Anchor, a [[borrowing_and_lending_mechanisms_on_inverse_finance | lending and borrowing]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   DOLA, their native stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

### DOLA Stablecoin

DOLA offers farming opportunities on both Ethereum (ETH) and Phantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For swapping DOLA, users can utilize either Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Stabilizer is Inverse Finance's proprietary liquidity pool, comprised of a DAI and DOLA pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It features a swap fee of approximately 0.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, guarantees a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, and holds about $4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Anchor Lending and Borrowing

Anchor serves as the central hub for [[borrowing_and_lending_mechanisms_on_inverse_finance | lending and borrowing]] activities on Inverse Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The platform's total value locked (TVL) is approximately $65 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Users can deposit assets to earn a base reward and additional rewards in IMV tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, depositing ETH yields a base reward of 0.08% APY and a 5.34% APR in IMV tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The IMV token itself stands out with a 122% APY when supplied to Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This high yield is achieved because supplying IMV on Anchor also simultaneously stakes the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## IMV Token and xIMV Staking Benefits

Inverse Finance aims to enhance the value of its governance token, IMV, through a staking mechanism that issues xIMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. When users deposit IMV into Inverse Finance, they receive xIMV in return, which provides several benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>:

1.  **IMV Emission**: Stakers receive IMV emissions approximately 6,400 times per day per Ethereum block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The annual percentage yield (APY) for staking IMV to receive xIMV is capped at 500% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This cap cannot be altered without a new governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   **Note**: There is no maximum supply for the IMV token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, if emission rates become excessively high, the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) can implement a cap, halting further minting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
2.  **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  **Voting Rights**: xIMV holders gain voting rights within the protocol's governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The governance page shows active polls, with 35 proposals made and 32 passed, including the recent Inverse Plus upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. All votes are conducted on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  **Collateral for Borrowing**: Perhaps the most notable feature is the ability to use xIMV as collateral to borrow DOLA stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This means users can:
    *   Buy IMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
    *   Supply IMV (earning 122% APY in IMV emissions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
    *   Earn a share of the protocol revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
    *   Vote in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
    *   Use the staked IMV (xIMV) as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

This mechanism allows for capital efficiency, as funds are not locked and continue to earn rewards even while being used as collateral for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Transparency Features

Inverse Finance provides a transparency tab on its platform, which links directly to its smart contracts and illustrates how they interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This section also presents financial figures, similar to reading a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

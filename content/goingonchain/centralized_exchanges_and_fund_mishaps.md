The cryptocurrency space periodically experiences incidents involving centralized exchanges (CeX) and fund transfers that trigger speculation and user concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Crypto.com's ETH Transfer Incident
On October 21st, 2022, Crypto.com sent 220,000 ETH to Gate.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The CEO of Crypto.com stated that this was a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a> and that the funds had been recovered with the help of Gate.io <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

This event led to speculation about exchanges potentially assisting each other by sending assets across platforms, possibly to facilitate Proof of Reserve audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Gate.io subsequently issued a clarification, stating that their Proof of Reserve, conducted on October 19th, did not include the deposit from Crypto.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Despite this clarification, users continued to withdraw assets from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Implications for Users
The incident highlighted the broader concern regarding the security of funds held on [[risks_associated_with_decentralized_finance_defi_and_centralized_finance_cefi | centralized exchanges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A key principle in crypto ownership, "not your key, not your coin," underscores the importance of self-custody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Recommendation
> It is generally advised to remove assets from [[risks_associated_with_decentralized_finance_defi_and_centralized_finance_cefi | centralized exchanges]] (CeX) for greater control over one's funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

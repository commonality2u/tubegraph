Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are unique digital assets, and their value can be influenced by various factors, including associated airdrops or features. Tokenization, in this context, refers to representing real-world or digital assets as fungible tokens on a blockchain, often allowing fractional ownership or liquidity.

## Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Acoin
The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a notable NFT collection. Holders of a BAYC NFT were eligible to receive Acoin [[difference_between_coins_and_tokens | tokens]] via an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A key characteristic of this airdrop was the absence of a "snapshot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, meaning that as long as one owned a BAYC NFT, they could claim the Acoin [[difference_between_coins_and_tokens | tokens]] once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This mechanism led to a surge in the BAYC floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Tokenization via NFTX Vaults
NFTs can be tokenized, similar to how Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. An NFTX vault, for instance, allows a collection of NFTs (like 5 BAYC NFTs) to be represented by a fungible token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. When one buys this token, they own parts of the underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Flash Loan Exploit
An anonymous individual leveraged the no-snapshot airdrop rule and a technique called a flash loan to claim Acoin [[difference_between_coins_and_tokens | tokens]] associated with BAYC NFTs without long-term ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### How a Flash Loan Works
A flash loan allows users to borrow a large amount of assets at a low cost, with the strict condition that the borrowed amount must be repaid within the same blockchain transaction (or block) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### The Exploit Steps
1.  **Identify Unclaimed NFTs**: The individual found an NFTX vault containing five BAYC NFTs that had not yet claimed their Acoin [[difference_between_coins_and_tokens | tokens]] airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  **Purchase and Leverage**: They purchased a BAYC NFT from OpenSea for approximately $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This BAYC was then used as collateral on the NFTX vault to take a flash loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Flash Loan Execution**: In a single Ethereum transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>:
    *   The individual borrowed the five BAYC NFTs from the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   Used these NFTs to claim approximately 60,000 worth of Acoin [[difference_between_coins_and_tokens | tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Returned the borrowed BAYC NFTs back to the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Sold the BAYC NFT initially purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   Sold the claimed Acoin [[difference_between_coins_and_tokens | tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  **Outcome**: The individual profited around $800,000 from this series of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

This event sparked debate on whether it constituted an "attack" or a clever "arbitrage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For those interested in learning more about flash loans, platforms like Aave provide documentation and tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

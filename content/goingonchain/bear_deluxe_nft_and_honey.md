Bear Deluxe is presented as one of three [[NFT with Passive Income | NFTs that can generate passive income]] without requiring active trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Key Features and Utility
*   **Floor Price:** The current floor price for a Bear Deluxe NFT is 2.55 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Total Supply:** There are 6,900 Bear Deluxe NFTs in total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Daily Earnings:** Each Bear Deluxe NFT can earn one jug of "honey" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Honey Utility:** While the price of honey is not yet established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, it has various uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For example, honey can be combined with a beehive to create a "B The Lightning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The "B The Lightning" is capable of minting 0.13 honey per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This system highlights how NFTs are evolving to become more like games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Important Considerations
The utility tokens like honey, similar to bananas from [[cyberkongz_nft_and_bananas | CyberKongz]] and cheese from [[non_fungible_mice_nft_and_cheese | Non Fungible Mice]], have specific use cases within their ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Users should conduct their own research before engaging, as these "farming tokens" could be subject to dumping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This is not financial advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

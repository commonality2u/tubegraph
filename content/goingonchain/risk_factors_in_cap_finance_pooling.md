Pooling assets on [[CAP Finance platform overview | CAP Finance]] for [[yield_generation_on_cap_finance | yield generation]] involves several risk factors that users should consider. It is important to note that pooling is not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>.

## Counterparty Risk (Trader Wins)

CAP Finance operates as a decentralized exchange where traders trade against a pool of ETH and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. The pool acts as the counterparty to the traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. This mechanism means that the attractive yields offered to liquidity providers (the house/market maker) come from traders' losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

*   **Potential Loss of Principal:** If a group of traders experiences significant wins, they will take profit directly from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. In such a scenario, liquidity providers might not get their full deposit back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. A large win from a group of traders could lead to a loss of deposit for the pooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:01">[02:28:01]</a>.

## Withdrawal Limitations and Fees

When withdrawing funds from the CAP Finance pool, certain conditions apply:

*   **Withdrawal Fees:** A 1% fee is charged for withdrawals from both the ETH and USDC pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.
*   **24-Hour Lock-Up Period:** After depositing money into the pool, there is a 24-hour lock-up period during which funds cannot be withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Dynamic Yields

The yield offered for pooling is dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:20">[02:24:20]</a>. As more funds are deposited into the pool, the yield is expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This means the high initial yields may not be sustained as the platform grows.

### General Risks

As with any engagement in [[risks_associated_with_decentralized_finance_defi_and_centralized_finance_cefi | decentralized finance (DeFi)]] and especially with [[risks_associated_with_new_investment_platforms | new investment platforms]], users should conduct their own research and be aware that past performance is not indicative of future results.

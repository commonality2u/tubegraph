The Terra ecosystem is currently experiencing an active NFT season, with significant market activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Current Landscape
A Google Sheet is available that tracks most of the current [[initial_nft_offering_and_launch_strategy | project launching]] on Terra. This resource was created by "the lady Joe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Notable Projects and Market Activity
NFTs like Galaxy Punk have been fetching very good prices on the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Incidents and Warnings
During periods of intense market activity, there is an increased risk of scams and unusual occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Two notable incidents highlight these risks:

### Kara Waifu Incident
Kara Waifu launched on "nowhere" but subsequently performed a rug pull, deleting all their social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It was also noted that their drawings appeared to be copied from other projects on different blockchain chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Terabytes Incident
The artist behind Terabytes deleted all social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, the artist reportedly donated all funds to the Angel Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. There are conflicting accounts regarding this incident:
*   Some believe the public's negative reception to the artwork contributed to the artist's withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Others suggest the artwork might have been generated using a "pixel dupe maker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Regardless of the specifics, both Kara Waifu and Terabytes projects are no longer active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Important Reminder
Given these incidents, it is crucial for individuals to conduct their own thorough research before engaging with any new NFT projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

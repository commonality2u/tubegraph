Blur is a new NFT marketplace and aggregator that offers a variety of features aimed at NFT traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In addition to its core marketplace functions, Blur provides real-time pricing and other tools for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Key Features

### NFT Listing Capabilities
Blur offers a robust listing setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Users can choose to list their NFTs exclusively on Blur or concurrently push listings to other marketplaces like LooksRare and OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The platform allows users to easily set prices, offering options such as listing at floor price, top trade, or using a ladder system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. An auto-adjust feature is also available for fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Fee Structure and Royalties
Blur does not charge a marketplace fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While paying royalties is optional, Blur incentivizes users to do so through "incentivized royalties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. If a user chooses to give royalties, they are rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategy aims to encourage more NFT listings and platform usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Loyalty Program
Blur incorporates a loyalty system for each wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Users earn high loyalty points if their NFTs are listed lowest on Blur compared to other marketplaces where they are also listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Higher loyalty points increase the odds of receiving "super rare care packages," which contain a greater number of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Confirmed Airdrops

Blur has confirmed two airdrop events for its Blur tokens, which are not speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Users can visit blur.io/airdrop to access information about these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Blur tokens are anticipated to be released in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Airdrop 1
[[blur_nft_airdrop_specifics | Airdrop 1]] was available to users who had traded NFTs in the six months prior to October 19, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The volume of their trades determined the number of "care packages" received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These care packages will later be converted into Blur tokens, with "legendary" packages containing more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Users had 14 days from October 19, 2022, to claim their Airdrop 1 care packages, with collection expected to end around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Airdrop 2
[[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrops | Airdrop 2]] is for users who missed the first airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. To qualify, users must list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While an explicit formula for Airdrop 2 distribution has not been shared, users can [[benefits_of_listing_nfts_on_blur | maximize]] their airdrop by listing more NFTs, especially blue-chip collections and active collections that generate trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Participating in incentivized royalties and maintaining high loyalty points also contribute to maximizing Airdrop 2 rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

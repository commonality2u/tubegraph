In the evolving landscape of decentralized finance, projects that continuously build and innovate, even during bear markets, are recognized for their solidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Spirit Swap is one such team, releasing their V2 with significant enhancements, particularly for Inspirit holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Inspirit holders, who undertake the increased risk of locking their tokens, are set to receive more substantial benefits and rewards in [[Spiritswap V2 features and improvements | Spiritswap V2]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:30">[04:26:30]</a>.

## Enhanced User Interface for Inspirit
The user interface for the Inspirit page has undergone a significant improvement in V2, moving from a cluttered and messy V1 layout to a much clearer and more organized presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:13">[03:36:13]</a>. The new design provides a clear voting page, allowing users to easily see where their votes are directed and how to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:06">[03:50:06]</a>. The dashboard also offers a transparent view of the current Inspirit balance and locked Spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:11">[03:59:11]</a>.

## Claimable Bribes Reward
One of the most anticipated features for Inspirit holders is the introduction of a claimable bribes reward system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:58">[04:06:58]</a>. Previously, protocols would directly drop bribes to users, making tracking and claiming tedious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:12">[04:09:12]</a>. With V2, Spirit Swap has integrated this functionality directly into the Inspirit page, allowing users to claim their rewards and bribe rewards conveniently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:34">[04:17:34]</a>.

## AMM Fee Distribution for Voters
The Automatic Market Maker (AMM) fees in [[AMM changes and pool types in Spiritswap V2 | Spiritswap V2]] have been adjusted from 0.3% to 0.18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:40">[04:34:40]</a>. This 0.18% fee is distributed as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:17">[04:40:17]</a>:
*   **25% Base Fee**: Allocated to all Inspirit holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:40">[04:43:40]</a>.
*   **25% Protocol Fee**: Directed to the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:17">[04:46:17]</a>.
*   **50% Voting Fee**: Distributed exclusively to Inspirit holders who vote for the gauge attached to a specific pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:23">[04:50:23]</a>.

### Example of Voting Fee Distribution
Consider an example where an Inspirit holder has 10 Inspirit tokens and directs them all to the Lqdr-FTM pool gauge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:10">[04:59:10]</a>. If this gauge receives a total of 100 Inspirit votes, the holder possesses a 10% share of that gauge's voting fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:48">[05:10:48]</a>. If the pool generates $100,000 in fees the following week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:29">[05:17:29]</a>:
*   $25,000 (25%) goes to all Inspirit holders via the base fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:56">[05:20:56]</a>.
*   $25,000 (25%) goes to Liquid Driver as protocol fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:14">[05:26:14]</a>.
*   $50,000 (50%) goes to the pool's vote fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:43">[05:29:43]</a>.
    *   The Inspirit holder, with their 10% share of this pool's voting fees, would receive $5,000 worth of Lqdr and FTM tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:16">[05:32:16]</a>.

## Real Yield Model to Prevent Dilution
The implementation of a real yield model significantly enhances the attractiveness of participating as an Inspirit holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:57">[05:40:57]</a>. In the past, Spirit emission would dilute Inspirit holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:49">[05:47:49]</a>. However, in V2, Inspirit holders will not be diluted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:13">[05:52:13]</a>.

### Example of Real Yield
For instance, if 100,000 Spirit tokens are to be emitted in a given week, and there are 500 million Spirit in total supply, with 200 million Spirit locked as Inspirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:50">[05:55:50]</a>. A calculation ensures that 40,000 Spirit will be distributed to Inspirit holders that week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:05">[06:07:05]</a>. This mechanism provides Inspirit holders with a subsidized flow of emissions, preventing dilution from farmers and making Inspirit an even more compelling asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

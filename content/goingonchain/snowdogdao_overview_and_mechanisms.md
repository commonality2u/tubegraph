SnowdogDAO is presented as a highly "degen" play, featuring very high APYs similar to how [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] initially launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The team behind SnowdogDAO remains anonymous, leading to concerns about potential rug pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It is explicitly stated that the high APYs are not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_typical_olympusdao_forks | Differences from Typical OlympusDAO Forks]]

SnowdogDAO is not a typical OlympusDAO fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The team utilizes the Olympus fork methodology primarily to raise capital for a meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Operational Mechanism and Timeline (8-Day Event)

The SnowdogDAO event is designed to last for eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Day 1 to Day 5:** Users can mint S-DOG tokens, causing the total supply to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The vesting period for minted S-DOG is three days, which is shorter than the typical five-day vesting period seen in projects like Wonderland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Day 5 Onwards:** Minting of S-DOG tokens ceases, but users can still redeem previously minted tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Day 8 (The "Big Day"):** This day is expected to be characterized by significant price volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   All assets held by the DAO, except for those in the liquidity pool, will be swapped for MIM (Magic Internet Money), a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   This MIM will then be used to buy S-DOG tokens from the S-DOG/MIM liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   The S-DOG tokens bought back will be burned, reducing the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Staking rewards will be paused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   S-DOG will transition to a fixed supply and become the main currency for a project called AVEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

In summary, Day 1 to Day 5 largely resembles an OlympusDAO model, but from Day 5 to Day 8, the mechanics change, ultimately leading to S-DOG becoming a meme token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Team

The same anonymous team responsible for [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] also released SnowdogDAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While the anonymity presents a risk of a rug pull, as of the recording, [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] was still operating without issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## [[market_impact_and_asset_movement_from_snowbank_to_snowdog | Market Impact]]

The launch of SnowdogDAO caused a price dump in [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] as users began to move liquidity from [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] to SnowdogDAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. SnowdogDAO's price saw a significant increase shortly after launch, peaking around $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## [[strategy_and_steps_for_participating_in_snowdogdao | Participation Strategy for Degens]]

For those interested in a "degen" approach, two main strategies are outlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>:

1.  **Minting with Highest Discount:**
    *   The S-DOG/MIM LP pool offers the highest discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   For example, S-DOG could be minted at $2,000 when the market price was $5,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   The vesting term is three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Upon vesting, users have two options:
        *   Claim and sell tokens at the market price if favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
        *   Claim and auto-stake to benefit from the high APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  **Speaker's Personal Strategy:** The speaker participated by "aping in" for two days, implementing a strategy of redeeming and selling every few hours to try and recover capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Risks

Several risks are highlighted:

*   **Speed Requirement:** Projects of this nature require quick entry and exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **New Project:** It is a new project and not a typical OlympusDAO fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Anonymous Team:** The team's anonymity introduces counterparty risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Degen Play:** The entire endeavor is classified as a "very degen play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Meme Coin Outcome:** After the eight-day period, the token will become a meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Projects with anonymous development teams in the cryptocurrency space, often referred to as "degen plays," present significant risks due to the lack of accountability and transparency. Snow Dog DAO is cited as an example of such a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Characteristics and Risks of Anonymous Team Projects

These types of projects often exhibit extremely high [[understanding_the_sources_of_crypto_yield_and_associated_risks | APY]]s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, such high [[understanding_the_sources_of_crypto_yield_and_associated_risks | APY]]s are typically unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

A major concern with anonymous teams is the potential for a [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | rug pull]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, where the developers abandon the project and make off with user funds. While a [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | rug pull]] might not always happen, the possibility exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Many of these projects, like Snow Dog DAO, utilize the Olympus DAO fork method to raise capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, they can have significant differences from typical Olympus DAO forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Case Study: Snow Dog DAO and Snowbank

The team behind Snow Dog DAO is the same as the one that released Snowbank, and they remain anonymous for both projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Snow Dog DAO was designed to operate for a limited period, specifically eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. During this period:
*   **Day 1 to Day 5**: Users could "mint" S-DOG tokens, increasing the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The vesting term for minting was three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Day 5 to Day 8**: Minting ceased, but redemption was still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Day 8**: The price was expected to become "super volatile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The project planned to take all assets (except the [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | liquidity]] pool), swap them for Magic Internet Money (MIM) stablecoin, and use it to buy S-DOG from the S-DOG/MIM [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | liquidity]] pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These bought S-DOG tokens would then be burned, reducing the supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Staking rewards would pause, and S-DOG would become a fixed-supply "meme currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

The project was described as a "degen play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, with the expectation that it would transition into a meme token after eight days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
When Snow Dog DAO launched, there was a dump on Snowbank as people moved [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | liquidity]] from Snowbank to Snow Dog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## General Risks and Considerations

For projects involving anonymous teams and "degen plays," the following risks and considerations are highlighted:

*   **Speed is crucial**: Such projects require a "fast in, fast out" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **New and unconventional**: They are often new and not typical forms of established protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **High risk**: The overall nature of these projects is considered very "degen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

> "This kind of project need to be fast in fast out and also this is a new project not your typical olympus dial form again the team is anonymous and this is a very degen play because this whole thing is going to last for 8 days after that you will be getting a bim coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>

It is strongly advised that any involvement in such projects is not financial advice, and individuals should always conduct their own research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

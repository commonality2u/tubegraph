Bridging UST (TerraUSD) to the [[Avalanche network features | Avalanche]] network can unlock various [[DeFi Yield Opportunities on Avalanche | farming opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Yield Opportunities on Avalanche

On Avalanche, users can potentially achieve significant yields:
*   Up to 56% in yield with the UST-AVAX pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.
*   For those concerned about impermanent loss, parking UST in a stablecoin pool can earn approximately 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This represents a viable [[DeFi strategies on Avalanche | DeFi strategy]] to mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Bridging Process using Satellite

To bridge UST from Terra to Avalanche, the Satellite software can be used, offering potentially better rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Steps to Bridge

1.  **Select Source Chain and Asset**: Choose "Terra" as the source chain and "UST" as the source asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  **Define Destination**: Specify "AVAX" as the destination chain and input your Avalanche address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   **Fees**: A transfer fee of 0.1% applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   **Minimum Transfer**: The minimum transfer amount is 15 UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
3.  **Connect Wallet & Transfer**: Click "Connect Wallet and Transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This will prompt a signature request on your MetaMask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
4.  **Sign Transaction**: Upon signing, a one-time deposit for the recipient will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Using the Keeper Wallet

A crucial step in this process involves the Keeper wallet, which is essential for the Cosmo ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

1.  **Transfer UST to Keeper**: You must move your UST from your Terra Station wallet to your Keeper wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  **Input Transfer Amount**: Once UST is in Keeper, specify the amount you wish to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  **Approve Transaction**: This action will trigger your Keeper wallet for approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   **Cost**: The transaction fee for sending is approximately 0.004 LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Completion and Usage

After approving the transaction, wait approximately three to five minutes for the transfer to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Your UST should then appear in your MetaMask wallet on the Avalanche network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Once UST is on Avalanche, you can use it on platforms like Pangolin to participate in stablecoin [[DeFi Yield Opportunities on Avalanche | farming opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

When managing cryptocurrency assets, the choice between cold wallets and hot wallets is a crucial decision, directly impacting the [[importance_of_storing_crypto_assets_safely|safety]] and accessibility of your funds. The overarching principle is "not your key is not your coin," emphasizing the importance of retaining control over your private keys rather than leaving assets on centralized exchanges (CeX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Cold Wallets

Ideally, the best method for storing crypto assets is using a cold wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are hardware devices that store your cryptocurrency offline, making them highly secure against online threats.

*   **Common Examples:** Ledger is a commonly used brand, but many other brands of cold wallets are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Security:** Cold wallets are considered the most secure option because they keep your private keys offline, away from potential hackers.

## Hot Wallets

While cold wallets are preferred, circumstances may necessitate the use of a hot wallet, especially for more frequent transactions or immediate access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Hot wallets are software-based and connected to the internet. As [[noncustodial_wallets_and_key_management|noncustodial wallets]], users are responsible for managing their own keys; losing these keys means losing access to all assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Hot wallets generally offer more control, allowing users to add networks and configure settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Specific Hot Wallet Examples and Their Use Cases:

*   **MetaMask:**
    *   Works for Ethereum (ETH), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Tron, and supports all EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) chains like AVAX, FTM, Matic, and Cronos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   **Limitation:** Cannot be used for Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Blue Wallet:**
    *   Recommended for storing Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Phantom Wallet:**
    *   Used for Solana (SOL) assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

    *   Suitable for Cosmos (ATOM) assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

    *   A simple, multi-chain hot wallet that allows storing Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and Cosmos assets all within one application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

    *   **Limitation:** Offers less configuration, as users cannot add custom networks or set custom RPCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   **Important Note on Versions:** Trust Wallet is *only* available as a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. To use Trust Wallet on a desktop, it must be connected via WalletConnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Any Trust Wallet Chrome extension found in the Chrome Web Store is a fake and a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

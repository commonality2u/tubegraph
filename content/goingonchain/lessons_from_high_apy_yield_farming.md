This article details a personal experience with [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield farming]], specifically focusing on the lessons learned from participating in a high Annual Percentage Yield (APY) farm and the mistakes made along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The speaker achieved a 10x gain from an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) before delving into this farming experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Case Study: Guys Farm on Phantom Network

Guys Farm is a decentralized, non-custodian money market on the Phantom network, similar in design to Aave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>. It launched on October 6th, initially attracting about $3 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL) on its first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

### Key Features and Rewards Structure

*   **Team Anonymity & Multisig**: The team behind Guys Farm is anonymous, but they implemented a multisig on their code for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:38">[01:33:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:44">[03:42:44]</a>. This requires three out of five high-profile individuals from the DeFi industry (including Filecoin Foundation, SpookySwap, DeFi Llama, and Guys) to sign off on any code changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:02">[03:59:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:18">[04:04:18]</a>. There is also a two-day time lock delay for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:24">[04:21:24]</a>.
*   **Decentralization**: The platform aims to differentiate itself by having no governance and no Venture Capital (VC) involvement, with all earned revenue going back to token holders and equity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>.
*   **Earning Rewards**: Users can earn Guys tokens by:
    *   Lending and borrowing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:40">[02:36:40]</a>.
    *   Providing liquidity to the Guys-FTM liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:45">[02:40:45]</a>.
    *   Receiving airdrops for supplying on Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>.
*   **Reward Penalties and Locking**: To prevent immediate dumping of rewards and protect the ecosystem, a 50% penalty is applied if rewards are claimed and exited within 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:06">[02:52:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:06">[03:02:06]</a>. Alternatively, users can lock their Guys tokens for three months to earn platform fees and supernative fees, but early exit is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:36">[03:23:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:36">[03:30:36]</a>.

## High APY Experience and Losses

The speaker initially jumped into the Guys-FTM liquidity pool due to its "super crazy" 10,000% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:49">[04:36:49]</a>.

*   **Initial Investment**: Approximately $2,800, a mix of USDT and FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:23">[05:15:23]</a>. The value of the liquidity pool was around $1,000 at the time of entry (Day 2 or 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:37">[05:31:37]</a>.
*   **Early Gains**: When Guys token was at $10 and daily APY was around 1.21%, the speaker was earning about 12 Guys tokens a day, equivalent to $120, demonstrating the "superpower of passive income" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:01">[06:39:01]</a>.
*   **The Painful Decline**: The situation became "very painful" when:
    1.  The price of the Guys farming token dropped significantly (e.g., from $10 to $2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:42">[08:24:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:42">[08:35:42]</a>.
    2.  The APY (and thus the quantity of tokens generated) decreased rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:40">[07:28:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:42">[08:38:42]</a>.
    3.  The value of both assets in the liquidity pool (Guys and FTM) dropped, leading to a "triple hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:49">[08:47:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:59">[09:53:59]</a>. The speaker was down about 20% on the total portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:31">[05:28:31]</a>.

## Key Learnings and Mistakes

The experience highlighted several critical lessons:

*   **Exposure to Multiple Volatile Assets**: Being exposed to two volatile assets (Guys and FTM) in a liquidity pool means a drop in both can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:51">[09:43:51]</a>.
*   **Capital Requirements for Stablecoin Farming**: While [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | using stablecoins]] like USDT, DAI, or USDC for farming can mitigate asset price exposure (as they are tied to $1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:13">[12:43:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:13">[13:02:13]</a>, the returns can be very slow unless one has a "huge capital" (e.g., $20k-$30k) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:12">[10:08:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:32">[13:24:32]</a>. This contrasts with "degen" strategies seeking high, fast returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:41">[13:37:41]</a>.
*   **Rapid Capital Flight**: Capital can flee platforms "much faster" than expected, especially with liquidity mining programs on competing chains drawing funds away quickly (e.g., money moving from Phantom to Harmony due to DeFi Kingdoms and Curve/Sushi integration) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:11">[10:30:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:22">[11:07:22]</a>.
*   **Chasing High APY**: Jumping into a farm solely because of extremely high APY can be a mistake, even if the team seems decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:38">[17:23:38]</a>. This is considered a "degenerate" (degen) strategy and requires caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:06">[18:57:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:06">[19:02:06]</a>.
*   **Breaking a Key Rule**: A common rule in [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield farming]], as taught by channels like "So Tacky," is "not to buy farm tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:45">[18:41:45]</a>. The speaker admits to breaking this rule by buying the farming tokens to put into the liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:52">[18:47:52]</a>.

> [!warning] The Triple Hit
> When [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | yield optimization]] goes wrong, it can be a "triple hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:18">[10:16:18]</a>:
> 1.  The price of the farming token drops.
> 2.  The APY declines.
> 3.  The value of the assets in the liquidity pool decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:30">[10:21:30]</a>.

## Next Steps and Risk Assessment

Despite the losses, the speaker decided not to "cut loss" by immediately withdrawing all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:07">[14:03:07]</a>. The strategy moving forward is to:

*   **Vest and Lock Rewards**: Every two days, earned Guys tokens will be exited from the pool (incurring the 50% penalty) and then locked into the platform for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:45">[16:42:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:45">[16:56:45]</a>.
*   **Earn Platform Fees**: This locking mechanism allows the user to earn platform fees (in DAI, Guys, ETH, FTM, and USDC) and penalty fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:51">[15:46:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:18">[17:04:18]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Outlook**: The speaker is taking a long-term approach, waiting for the lock to expire in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:04">[16:59:04]</a>. The decision is based on the Guys Network's continued position as the second-highest TVL protocol on the Phantom network, indicating "strong potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:45">[19:32:45]</a>.
*   **Max Loss**: The speaker is willing to accept a maximum loss of $1,500 if the platform were to completely shut down and Guys token went to zero, as some capital (FTM and stablecoins) can still be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:10">[16:02:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:32">[16:15:32]</a>.

> [!info] Monitoring is Key
> For non-stablecoin [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield farming]] in liquidity pools, constant monitoring is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:42">[12:22:42]</a>.

This experience underscores the volatility and risks inherent in high APY [[yield_farming_vs_real_yield | yield farming]], especially when dealing with new, non-stablecoin assets.

Collateral plays a crucial role within the [[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor Protocol's business model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, primarily facilitating the [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | borrowing of funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and contributing to the system's yield generation.

## Collateral in the Lending and Borrowing Process

When a user, like Bob, wishes to [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | borrow money]] on Anchor, they must provide their crypto assets as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This means they "stick" or stake their crypto as a collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. An example given is Bob using $3,000 in bLuna as collateral to borrow $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Staking Rewards from Collateral

A significant aspect of collateral on Anchor is the "sticking reward" or staking reward it generates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This reward is based on the value of the collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For instance, if the staking reward return is 5.83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, a collateral of $3,000 would generate approximately $150 in staking rewards (3000 * 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Contribution to Anchor's Business Model

The staking rewards generated from the collateral are a key component of how Anchor Protocol maintains its high yield for lenders, who can earn [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | up to 19-20% in interest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The total amount collected from both the borrower's interest payments and the collateral's staking rewards is pooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This pooled sum is then distributed, with a portion going to the lender (e.g., Alice expecting 20% APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, and the remainder going to the [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | Anchor yield reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This mechanism showcases the power of decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

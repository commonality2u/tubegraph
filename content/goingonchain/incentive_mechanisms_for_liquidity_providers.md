## What are Crypto Bribes?
Crypto bribes are an open and transparent incentive mechanism used within decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, specifically decentralized exchanges (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Unlike traditional bribes, crypto bribes are publicly declared, for example, a protocol might tell a holder to vote for them in exchange for a share of a "bribe" worth a certain value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Changing the Game for DEXs
Historically, [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity pool providers]] and stakers would farm for DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The relationship between protocols and [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity providers]] often involved protocols seeking high liquidity, which [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity providers]] could supply, often with the readiness to "dump" the DEX token at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Crypto bribes introduce a new dynamic where DEXs openly announce that a percentage of their token emissions (e.g., 30%) will be distributed based on votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The protocol that receives the highest number of votes gets the largest portion of these emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How Crypto Bribes Work
Protocols compete for votes to increase their DEX token reward for their specific liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This competition, in turn, attracts more [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity providers]] to their pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Participants are also incentivized to buy the protocol's own tokens to chase higher Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This mechanism can also help push up the price of the protocol's token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

[[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | Liquidity providers]] become less willing to sell their DEX tokens because they need them to vote, often for their own pools, to ensure they win more emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Protocols may also buy DEX tokens to gain votes, adding buying pressure to the DEX token itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

The concept of crypto bribes allows a project to offer incentives (e.g., up to 100k VIS) directly to DEX token holders to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This attracts DEX token holders, even if they are not already part of the specific protocol's liquidity pool, by offering them a share of the bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Stakers of DEX tokens also benefit, as they can use their tokens to vote and earn additional yield instead of selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Aligned Incentives
This system creates an alignment of incentives among various stakeholders:
*   **Stakers and [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | Liquidity Providers]]**: They are incentivized to hold their DEX tokens to vote and earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Traders**: Benefit from low slippage and high liquidity in the DEX, which generates more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Protocols**: Gain from increased liquidity and participants buying their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **DEX Token**: Experiences increased buying pressure as holders seek to acquire more tokens to benefit from the bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Case Study: BEETS
Prior to January, the BEETS token often experienced selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. After initiating bribe offerings of 30% of their emissions on January 6th, voting increased, leading to higher demand for BEETS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. While not eliminating all selling pressure, the bribes created strong buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Another example of a DEX utilizing crypto bribes is SpiritSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, with projects like Greater DAO offering bribes through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Investment Considerations
When investing in DEX tokens, it is advisable to look for projects with similar incentive setups where all stakeholders' interests are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Without such alignment, a DEX token risks primarily being a "farming token," which can lead to consistent sell pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | Crypto lending platforms]] function similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) lending models like Funding Society or Moolah Sense [00:00:17]. These platforms allow individuals to act as either lenders or borrowers [00:00:23]. As a lender, you deposit cryptocurrency and earn interest in return [00:00:27]. As a borrower, you can deposit crypto as collateral to receive a loan, and your crypto is returned upon repayment of the loan and interest [00:00:31].

## Featured Platforms

This article compares three prominent [[specific_crypto_option_platforms | crypto lending platforms]]: BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Hodlnaut [00:00:37]. The rates discussed are current as of June 20, 2021 [00:03:04].

### BlockFi
BlockFi is a well-known platform regulated in the U.S. [00:01:05].
*   **Interest Payouts**: Interest is paid out monthly [00:00:53].

## Comparison of Features and Fees
A summary of features for the three platforms:
*   **Deposit Fees**: None for any of the platforms [00:02:09].
*   **Withdrawal Fees**: Celsius Network stands out with no withdrawal fees [00:02:12], while BlockFi and Hodlnaut have them [00:00:57, 00:01:57].

*   **Payout Period**: BlockFi pays monthly [00:00:53], while Celsius Network and Hodlnaut provide weekly payouts [00:02:24].

When comparing [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest rates]], Hodlnaut generally provides the highest rates for stablecoins [00:02:31]. However, Celsius Network is considered very attractive due to its combination of no withdrawal fees, larger coin selections, weekly payouts, and decent interest rates [00:02:34].

## [[considerations_and_risks_in_using_crypto_lending_platforms | Considerations and Risks]]
It is crucial to consider the inherent risks involved in using these platforms. For example, if a platform like Celsius Network were to fail ("say gg"), any funds held on it would also be at risk [00:02:41].

## [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | Strategies for Earning Interest]]
If you already hold cryptocurrencies, you might consider lending them out to earn interest [00:02:47]. If you don't own crypto, you could consider buying stablecoins like USDT or USDC. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by the US dollar, similar to holding US dollars, but they offer significantly higher interest rates than traditional banks [00:02:51].

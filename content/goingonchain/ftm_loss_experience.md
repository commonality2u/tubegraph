On a "grim Sunday," the speaker experienced a significant financial loss due to a hack on Grim Finance related to a Tomb FTM vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The entire position was lost, which was described as a "very painful" experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The pain was exacerbated by the timing: the position was established on a Saturday night, and the hack occurred early Sunday morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The primary lesson derived from this incident is the principle: "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## DeFi Insurance Recommendation

For individuals engaging in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), especially those with large positions, it is advisable to purchase insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

> "If you are in a large position it's better for you to buy insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

Suggested insurance platforms include:
*   **InsureDAO**: While it did not cover Grim Finance, it provides coverage for other protocols within the Fantom ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, if one has a large position in Abracadabra, insurance can be purchased against potential hacks, allowing for money reclamation if an incident occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Anchor Protocol Insurance**: The speaker personally utilizes Anchor Protocol insurance, though it tends to run out quickly, requiring frequent checks for availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A referral code is mentioned for obtaining discounts on insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Future Content

The speaker plans to share portfolio updates and strategies for different risk profiles to assist others in getting started in DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

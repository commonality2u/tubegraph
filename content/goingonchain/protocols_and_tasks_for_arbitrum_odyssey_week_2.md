From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

[[arbitrum_odyssey_week_2_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey Week 2]] was initially scheduled to begin, but the campaign was paused due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Reasons for Pause
The primary reason for pausing the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was a significant surge in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. At one point, a single swap transaction reportedly cost around $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This high cost is particularly problematic for an [[layer_2_solutions_and_arbitrums_role | L2]] solution, which is designed to provide cheaper gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The campaign will resume once "Nitro" is launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Nitro is described as an accelerated version of Arbitrum, designed to help reduce the heavy load on the chain and consequently lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Important Reminders
For participants who have already bridged assets to Arbitrum, it is now possible to collect the Week 1 [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
If the bridging process was completed using [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | Hop]], users should check their Discord for instructions on how to collect a bonus [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | Hop]] recorded the highest bridging volume during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Additionally, [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | Hop]] announced the winners of a small [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | NFT]] giveaway, and participants can check if their address is among the 10 winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Proposed Protocols and Tasks for Week 2
For the supposed [[arbitrum_odyssey_week_2_overview | Week 2]] of the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]], two main protocols were featured for tasks: Yield Protocol and GMX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### 1. Yield Protocol
Yield is a fixed-rate borrowing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Users can provide collateral to borrow stablecoins like USDC or DAI at a fixed interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Currently, a 0% fixed rate is available with a maturity date of September 30, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. If the loan is not paid back on time, the interest rate converts to a variable rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Lending is also an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>; for example, lending 50 USDC with a September maturity allows early withdrawal, though it may incur slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

To qualify for the [[arbitrum_odyssey_week_2_overview | Week 2]] tasks on Yield, participants needed to complete one of three actions with a minimum sum of $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>:
*   Lend $50 or more of an asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Provide $50 or more in liquidity (LP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Borrow $100 or more in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
The easiest option is to lend $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. GMX
GMX is a perpetual trading platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, well-known in the crypto community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Users can long, short, and swap tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

To qualify for the [[arbitrum_odyssey_week_2_overview | Week 2]] tasks on GMX, participants needed to complete all three actions with a minimum sum of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
*   Open a leverage trade (long or short) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. An array of assets is available for leverage trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   Perform a token swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Mint GLP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   GLP is a liquidity provider token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   When GLP is purchased, it is automatically staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   The current Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for GLP is 16.87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
    *   Rewards are distributed in ETH, currently at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This makes GLP a popular way for users to accumulate ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_campaign_overview | Arbitrum Odyssey campaign]] will resume once Nitro is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, allowing participants to continue collecting [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | NFTs]] and potentially qualify for future [[speculations_about_an_arbitrum_airdrop | airdrops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

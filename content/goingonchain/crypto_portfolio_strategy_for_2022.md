This article outlines a crypto portfolio strategy for 2022, focusing on current holdings, a unique borrowing approach, and three key investment areas identified for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Current Portfolio & Accumulation Strategy

The speaker's current crypto portfolio includes Luna, Ethereum (ETH), Heroes, and Player as the top three holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The strategy involves continuing to accumulate Luna and ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Instead of selling these assets, the approach is to borrow money using them as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This method avoids the need to bring in substantial fresh funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Luna:** Used to borrow UST from Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Ethereum:** Staked in MakerDAO to borrow stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The borrowed stablecoins are then used to [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | invest elsewhere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This strategy is part of a broader [[building_cryptocurrency_portfolios | cryptocurrency portfolio building]] approach.

## Key Investment Areas for 2022

Three main areas are being focused on for investments in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:

### 1. Ethereum Layer 2 Solutions

There is an anticipation of significant discussion and activity around Ethereum Layer 2 solutions, especially within the first six months of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Smart money is already moving into Layer 2 protocols, and centralized exchanges are integrating Layer 2 networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   Binance is adding Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   OKEx is adding ZK-Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Specific Layer 2 networks of interest include Optimistic Arbitrum One and ZK-Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### 2. Metaverse and Play-to-Earn Games

While prices of metaverse tokens have decreased from their highs, games remain a crucial factor for driving wider crypto adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Games that integrate DeFi elements are particularly compelling, with Defi Kingdom cited as an example that has seen price increases even during bearish periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Instead of directly investing in games, the focus is on gaming DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. These DAOs function like talent agencies, recruiting players who earn from games, with a portion of the revenue shared back to the DAO's treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Yield Guild Games (YGG) had 845 million in its treasury as of September data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Current portfolio holdings include "Mary Circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Watchlist items include YGG SEA (a sub-DAO of YGG) and Avocado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

This approach relates to [[treasury_and_asset_accumulation_strategy | treasury and asset accumulation strategies]] within the crypto space.

### 3. Multi-chain Projects

Interest extends to multi-chain projects, with current holdings in Spell and Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. There is also an interest in accumulating Ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. An experimental sub-portfolio was created with a 1k investment split between Time (40%), Spell (30%), and Ice (30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Specific multi-chain projects detailed:
*   **Wonderland Money (TIME):** The largest DAO, holding $1 billion in assets and generating approximately $144,000 daily, which equates to about $52 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Wonderland plans to expand to be multi-chain starting in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This highlights [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] focused on high-performing DAOs.
*   **Popsicle Finance (ICE):** Specializes in yield optimization on Uniswap V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. As Uniswap V3 expands to Polygon, Popsicle Finance will follow, anticipating a significant influx of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This is relevant to [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | earning interest on crypto assets]].
*   **Abracadabra (SPELL):** Already multi-chain on BSC and soon expanding to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Abracadabra demonstrates substantial usage in managing "internet money" and generates considerable fees weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

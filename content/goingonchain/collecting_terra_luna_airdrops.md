Holding [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop|LUNA]] has presented opportunities for growth, allowing holders to earn more [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop|LUNA]] and participate in airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Staking LUNA to Earn Rewards and Airdrops

To earn additional [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop|LUNA]], you must stake your existing [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop|LUNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This process begins by accessing the staking feature within your [[using_terra_wallet_for_staking_operations|Terra wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Upon entering the staking section, you will find a list of 105 validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These validators are initially sorted by uptime, but you have the option to re-sort them by commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Choosing a Validator

When selecting a validator for [[staking_luna_for_rewards|staking LUNA]], several factors should be considered:

*   **Decentralization Principle**
    *   It is generally advised not to stake with the top 5 validators to prevent excessive power concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Validator Criteria**
    *   **Voting Power:** This indicates the validator's influence within the network. For example, "oral money" has a voting power of six percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
    *   **Self-Delegation:** This metric represents the amount of [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop|LUNA]] the validator has staked themselves, demonstrating their commitment or "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A higher self-delegation amount is generally preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   **Commission:** This is the percentage of your rewards that the validator retains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Validators offering zero percent commission are often sought after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   **Uptime:** It is crucial to select validators with 100% uptime, as you will not earn rewards if the validator is not operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Delegating LUNA**
    *   Once a validator is chosen, click the "delegate" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    *   Input the desired amount of [[luna_classic_and_new_luna_token_airdrop|LUNA]] to stake, then proceed by selecting "next" and "go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
    *   Upon completion, your [[using_terra_wallet_for_staking_operations|Terra wallet]] will display a summary of your delegated amount and the [[staking_luna_for_rewards|LUNA]] rewards you are earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

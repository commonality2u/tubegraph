NFTs can be utilized to generate passive income, rather than solely through trading and reselling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This involves owning an NFT that produces a fungible token with a specific utility.

## CyberKongz

CyberKongz are described as an original (OG) method for earning passive income from NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
*   **Total Supply**: 1,000 CyberKongz were released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **Floor Price**: As of the recording, the floor price for a CyberKong was 155 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   **Earning Mechanism**: Owning a CyberKong allows you to earn 10 "bananas" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
*   **Banana Value**: One banana is valued at 75 USD, meaning an owner can make 750 USD daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **Utility of Bananas**: Bananas have utility, creating a market for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. They are required to:
    *   Set a biography for your CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
    *   Rename your CyberKong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
    *   Breed to produce "baby Kongz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Bear Deluxe

Bear Deluxe NFTs also offer a passive income stream.
*   **Floor Price**: The floor price was 2.55 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Total Supply**: There are 6,900 Bear Deluxe NFTs in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Earning Mechanism**: Each Bear Deluxe NFT can earn one "jug of honey" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Honey Utility**: While the price of honey was not yet established, it enables actions such as adding a beehive to turn a Bee Deluxe into a Bee Lightning, which can then mint 0.13 honey per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The NFTs are evolving to be more like a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Non-Mine (Minted Mice)

The Non-Mine NFT collection, featuring "minted mice," operates with a unique passive income model.
*   **Floor Price**: The floor price was approximately 9 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Total Supply & Burning**: Out of 10,000 minted mice, 6,450 have been burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Breeding Mice**: The remaining 3,550 mice are crucial as they are the only ones capable of breeding and producing new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Earning/Breeding Mechanism**:
    *   To earn "cheese," you must stake your mice. One mouse can yield one cheese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   A maximum of 10 mice can be staked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Cheese can also be acquired through Uniswap or private sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Two mice, along with cheese, are required to breed a new mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Breeding Notes**: When breeding, the two parent mice are burned, and the newly produced mouse cannot breed itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

These examples demonstrate how NFTs can generate passive income through associated tokens (like bananas, honey, and cheese) which have specific utilities within their respective ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:02">[01:42:02]</a>.

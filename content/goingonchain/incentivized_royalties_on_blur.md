Blur, an NFT marketplace and aggregator, has introduced incentivized royalties as a feature within its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While Blur does not impose a marketplace fee, setting royalties is optional for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## How Incentivized Royalties Work

If a user chooses to set royalties on their NFTs listed on Blur, they are rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This mechanism is known as "incentivized royalties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Users have the option not to give royalties, but if they do, they will receive a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Purpose of Incentivized Royalties

Blur implemented this system because, as a marketplace, it aims to encourage users to list more of their NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A higher volume of listed NFTs naturally attracts more users to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Connection to Blur Airdrops

Choosing to give royalties contributes to the second round of Blur's confirmed airdrop program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This strategy is part of a broader set of [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrops|strategies to maximize airdrop rewards]], which also includes listing more NFTs, especially blue-chip and active collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Blur tokens themselves are expected to be distributed in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

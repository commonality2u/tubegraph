The previously stable and high [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] of 19.5% on Anchor Protocol is expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This change is due to a newly passed vote that will make the earn rate [[Dynamic Saving Rate on Anchor | dynamic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The primary objective of this adjustment is to make Anchor more [[Strategies to improve Anchors borrowing | sustainable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Dynamic Interest Rate Formula

The specific change in the [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] will be governed by a "magical formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. As an example:
*   If the yield reserve increases by 5%, the [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] will increase by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   If the yield reserve drops by 5%, the [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] will decrease by 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

This adjustment will occur on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Current Yield Reserve Trend

Over the past 30 days, the yield reserve has been on a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This decline is attributed to more people depositing funds than [[Lending and borrowing process on Anchor Protocol | borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Strategies to Improve Sustainability

To address the imbalance and improve the yield reserve, Anchor is planning to [[Strategies to improve Anchors borrowing | add more collateral]] options to the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   Recently, [[AVAX Collateral and Borrowing on Anchor | AVAX]] was added as collateral, allowing [[AVAX Collateral and Borrowing on Anchor | AVAX]] users to [[Lending and borrowing process on Anchor Protocol | borrow]] UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   However, adding new collateral types takes time and cannot be done rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Personal Strategy

Given the current trends and the time required to implement new collateral options, it is anticipated that the [[interest_rates_on_anchor_protocol | interest rate]] on Anchor will likely start to decrease in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Even with potential drops, the rate is expected to remain significantly higher than traditional local bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The speaker's personal strategy is to:
*   Continue using Anchor due to the anticipated interest rate still being competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Adopt a wait-and-see approach regarding the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Begin exploring other options for [[earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | stablecoin use]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Astroport is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Terra that aims to be a decentralized platform for token exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The project has a specific plan for its tokenomics and distribution, including an initial token drop strategy.

## Token Breakdown and Allocation

The Astroport token distribution is structured as follows:
*   **Liquidity Pool Providers (LPs):** 55% of tokens are allocated to liquidity pool providers, distributed over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Team and Investors:** 30% of tokens are allocated to the team and investors, distributed over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Additionally, Astroport will feature two other sub-tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## [[astroport_launch_details_and_token_drop_strategy | Token Drop Strategy]]

Astroport will not conduct an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) but will instead distribute its tokens via a token drop mechanism broken down into three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The three phases of the token drop are:

1.  **DeFi Participant Airdrop:** Individuals who participated in DeFi activities on Terra, particularly farming, are expected to receive an airdrop of tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Specific details on eligibility criteria for this phase were not fully disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
2.  **[[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] Liquidity Provider Migration:** Users who provide liquidity on [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] are invited to migrate their liquidity to Astroport. Those who move their liquidity will receive tokens as an incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Astroport UST Pool Commitment:** Tokens earned from the first two phases can be committed to the Astroport UST pool to earn even more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Phases two and three of the token drop include a lockup period, which users can choose the duration for within the user interface, similar to Pylon Protocol's vesting periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

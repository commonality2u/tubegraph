Cidadao is a platform that integrates blockchain technology with [[tangibles_real_estate_investment_model | real estate investment]], distinguishing itself from other DeFi projects by being backed by physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Introducing Real Estate On-Chain (IRO) Process

The platform facilitates the process of bringing commercial property owners' assets onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This is achieved through a process called IRO, or "Introducing Real Estate On-Chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### IRO Mechanism
During an IRO, participants commit a minimum sum of USDC into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Successful IRO:** If the minimum sum is met, tokens and rewards are distributed to participants, and the property is effectively brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful IRO:** If the minimum sum is not met, funds are refunded to participants, and the property is not bought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Participants cannot withdraw their committed funds until the IRO field is successful or failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### IRO Rewards
The project distributes IRO rewards directly to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agents, thereby compensating those who commit funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, if a daily reward is $1000 and a participant commits $1000 on day one with no other commitments, they would receive 100% of that reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. If another participant commits $9000 on day two, the first participant's share of the reward would decrease to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### First Project Example: Cardiff Building
The first property to undergo the IRO process is the "Cardiff building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **IRO Duration:** 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **IRO Value:** Approximately $21 million, which is the sum that needs to be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **IRO Reward:** Approximately $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Property Details:** A detailed page is available highlighting the property's fair value, stable income, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Tokenomics

Cidadao utilizes two primary tokens:

1.  **RET (Real Estate Token):** If an IRO is successful, committed USDC is swapped for RET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. RET can be sold on Uniswap or used to earn Knight tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This represents the [[converting_real_world_assets_into_nfts | conversion of real-world assets into a digital token]].
2.  **Knight (Cidadao Governance Token):** Knight is the platform's [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | governance token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Owning Knight provides exposure to other properties listed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The platform receives 2% of all properties listed on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

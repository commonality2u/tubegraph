Mofo, a lending and borrowing market, has developed technology so robust that other prominent platforms are looking to adopt or integrate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Its modular and [[permissionless_and_customizable_markets_in_mofo | permissionless]] architecture makes it an attractive solution for various blockchain ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Interest from Compound

Even established decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols like Compound are looking to adopt Mofo's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This comes as Compound, an "OG" in the space, has been losing Total Value Locked (TVL) in comparison to newer DeFi applications, while Mofo has been gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:03:45]</a>. Unlike Compound, where updating tokens or changing interest rates goes through a governance model, Mofo's design is permissionless and modular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:59">[02:13:59]</a>.

## Bera Chain's Integration

Bera Chain is set to pay a license fee to fork Mofo's technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They require a new, clean, and modular money market that can seamlessly integrate into their existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Mofo's modular design makes it easier to plug into their native tokenomics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Key Differentiators Attracting Adoption

Mofo's core technological advantages include:
*   **Isolated Markets** Each market on Mofo operates in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This means that if one market, for example, the WETH/USDC market, were to be exploited, the rest of the markets would not be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. This contrasts with common pool models like Aave, where a single supplied asset allows borrowing from a broad list of assets within the common pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **[[permissionless_and_customizable_markets_in_mofo | Permissionless Market Creation]]** Anyone can create a Mofo market by providing five essential parameters: the collateral asset, loan asset, Loan-to-Value (LTV), interest rate model, and oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **[[permissionless_and_customizable_markets_in_mofo | Customizable Parameters]]** While these parameters are [[permissionless_and_customizable_markets_in_mofo | customizable]] at creation, once set in the smart contract, they cannot be changed, providing users with certainty about market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Modular Design** The overall modularity of Mofo's architecture makes it highly adaptable and easy for other platforms to integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

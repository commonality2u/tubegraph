Blur is a new [[blur_nft_marketplace_features | NFT marketplace]] and aggregator that provides features and real-time pricing for NFT traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Listing NFTs on Blur offers several advantages, primarily through its confirmed airdrop program and unique platform functionalities.

## Confirmed Airdrops

Blur has a confirmed [[blur_nft_airdrop_specifics | airdrop]] program, not speculation, which can be accessed at blur.io/airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This program consists of two phases: Airdrop 1 and Airdrop 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Airdrop 1
Airdrop 1 was allocated to users who had traded NFTs in the six months prior to October 19, 2022, with care packages distributed based on trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. These care packages will later convert into Blur tokens, with "legendary" packages containing more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The claim period for Airdrop 1 was 14 days from October 19, 2022, estimated to end around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Airdrop 2
For those who missed Airdrop 1, Airdrop 2 is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To qualify for Airdrop 2, users must list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. While there's no explicit formula, [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrops | maximizing the airdrop]] involves listing more NFTs, including blue-chip collections and active collections that generate volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The Blur tokens are expected to be released in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Advanced Listing Features
Blur offers a sophisticated listing setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Users can list their NFTs on Blur exclusively or concurrently push their listings to other marketplaces like LooksRare and OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The platform also allows for easy price setting, including options to set prices at floor price, top trade, or using a ladder system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Additionally, users can auto-adjust for all fees, simplifying the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Marketplace Fee Structure
Blur does not impose a marketplace fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While providing creator royalties is optional, Blur offers [[incentivized_royalties_on_blur | incentivized royalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This means if a user chooses to give royalties, they will be rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This incentive encourages users to list more NFTs, which helps grow the platform's user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Loyalty Program
Every wallet on Blur has a loyalty point system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Users earn higher loyalty points if they list their NFTs lowest on Blur compared to other marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Higher loyalty points increase the odds of receiving "super rare" care packages, which contain a significantly larger amount of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

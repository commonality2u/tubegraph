Inverse Finance recently upgraded its governance token to [[inverse_finance_governance_token_upgrade | Inverse Plus]], aiming to add more value beyond just voting rights, calling it a "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Core Products
Inverse Finance offers three main products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>:
1.  **IMV Token**: For buying and staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Anchor**: A platform for lending and [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  **DOLA**: Their native [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## DOLA Stablecoin
DOLA is Inverse Finance's [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Farming Opportunities**: [[yield_farming_and_liquidity_pools_in_Inverse_Finance | Yield farming]] opportunities for DOLA are available on Ethereum and Fantom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Swapping**: DOLA can be swapped using Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   **Stabilizer**: This is Inverse Finance's own [[yield_farming_and_liquidity_pools_in_Inverse_Finance | liquidity pool]], consisting of a DAI and DOLA pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
        *   The swap fee is approximately 0.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
        *   It guarantees a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
        *   The pool has about $4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Anchor: Lending and Borrowing
Anchor is the lending and [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrowing]] platform within Inverse Finance, with a Total Value Locked (TVL) of around $65 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Users can deposit assets to earn a base reward and a rewards APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, depositing ETH yields a base reward of 0.08% APY and an IMV token APR of 5.34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **IMV Token High APY**: Supplying IMV tokens on Anchor stands out with an APY of 122% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This high return is because supplying IMV also involves staking it simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## IMV Token: Inverse Plus Benefits
The [[inverse_finance_governance_token_upgrade | Inverse Plus]] upgrade focuses on bringing more value to the governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. When users deposit IMV into Inverse Finance, they receive xIMV, which comes with several benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

1.  **IMV Emission**: xIMV holders receive IMV emission, which is distributed per Ethereum block (approximately 6,400 times a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   Staking IMV to get xIMV has a cap of 500% APY, which can only be changed through a new governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   There is no maximum supply for the IMV token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, if the emission rate becomes too high, the DAO can introduce a cap, and minting will cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

2.  **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a cut of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

3.  **Voting Rights**: xIMV grants voting rights within the Inverse Finance governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The governance page shows active polls, with 35 proposals made and 32 passed, all through on-chain voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The [[inverse_finance_governance_token_upgrade | Inverse Plus]] proposal itself was recently passed via this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

4.  **Collateral for Borrowing DOLA**: One of the most notable features is the ability to use xIMV as collateral to [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | borrow]] DOLA [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   This means users can buy IMV, supply it to earn IMV emission (e.g., at 122% APY), earn a share of protocol revenue, vote in governance, and simultaneously use their staked IMV as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   This offers significant capital efficiency, as funds are not locked and continue to earn rewards while being used as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For example, $100 worth of staked IMV used to borrow $30 of DOLA still earns the 122% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Transparency
Inverse Finance also features a transparency tab, which is noted as a unique offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This tab provides smart contract links and details on how these contracts interact, along with financial numbers, similar to a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

[[importance_of_digital_security_and_asset_management_in_cryptocurrency | Digital security and asset management]] are critical in the world of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A personal experience highlights the severe consequences of security breaches in decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Risk of Hacks

A significant loss occurred when Grim Finance was hacked on a Sunday morning, just after a position was established on Saturday night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This event resulted in the loss of an entire position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Protecting Your Assets

A fundamental lesson learned from such incidents is: "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This emphasizes the [[importance_of_storing_crypto_assets_safely | importance of storing crypto assets safely]] and the need for robust [[security_measures_for_cryptocurrency_wallets | Security measures for cryptocurrency wallets]].

## Insurance as a Safeguard

For individuals with large positions in DeFi, purchasing insurance is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Insure**: One option is Insure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While it did not cover Grim Finance, it does cover other protocols within the Fantom ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. For example, if you have a large position in Abracadabra, you can buy insurance against a hack, allowing you to claim back your funds if an incident occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Anchor Protocol Insurance**: Insurance for Anchor Protocol is also available, though it tends to run out quickly, requiring frequent checks for availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Referral codes can be used to obtain discounts on insurance purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Portfolio Management and Risk

When considering [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investing]], it is important to develop a [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | cryptocurrency investment approach]] that aligns with different [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | risk profiles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Understanding and [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | managing risk]] is a continuous journey in the DeFi space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

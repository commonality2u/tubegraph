Cryptocurrency scams are prevalent, and users should exercise caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. One common tactic involves a "USDT scam" that preys on individuals trying to be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## The USDT Gas Fee Siphoning Scam

This scam typically begins on [[social_media_and_telegram_scams | social media]], such as Telegram or Instagram, where an individual DMs the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### How the Scam Works
1.  **Initial Contact & Deception**: The scammer provides a wallet address and seed phrase, claiming they have difficulty withdrawing assets and asking for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. They might use a story, such as being sick, to elicit sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  **Wallet Bait**: Upon loading the provided wallet, the target will see a significant amount of USDT (e.g., $1135) but no gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
3.  **The Trap**: If the target tries to help by loading gas fees (e.g., TRX for a Tron wallet), the moment the gas is added, it is immediately siphoned to another wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Technical Explanation of the Siphoning
The scam leverages specific cryptocurrency wallet permissions:
*   When examining the scam wallet on a blockchain explorer (like TronScan), while the address might be, for example, `GT9H`, the "owner permission" is actually held by a different wallet, such as `W19C` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The "active permission" also belongs to this separate wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   This means the scammer (via the `W19C` wallet) has control over the `GT9H` wallet's operations, even though the `GT9H` address is visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Any gas (e.g., TRX) sent to the scam wallet (e.g., `GT9H`) is immediately transferred out to the scammer's main wallet (e.g., `2QPE`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   This actual scammer's wallet accumulates all the siphoned [[gas_fees_siphoning_in_crypto_scams | gas fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, one such wallet accumulated about $2,000 in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### What Not to Do
*   Do not attempt to "help" by sending gas fees to such a wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Do not attempt to change the wallet permissions. Clicking "edit access" and saving will incur a fee (e.g., 100 TRX), which will also be immediately sent to the scammer's wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### How to Recognize Scam Wallets
*   **Check Owner Permissions**: On a blockchain explorer, a normal wallet's "owner permission" key should be identical to the wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If the owner permission is different, it's a strong indicator of a scam wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Check Active Permissions**: Similarly, the "active permission" key should also match the wallet address for a legitimate wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. If it's different, it's a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] [[protecting_against_scams | Be cautious]] of unsolicited DMs on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. People are falling for these scams, sending money that is immediately siphoned away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While some claim this trick is to scam other scammers, innocent people can also fall victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Always be careful in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

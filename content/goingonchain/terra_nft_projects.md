A Google Sheet, created by "the lady Joe," tracks most of these new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Incidents and Scams

When the market experiences rapid growth, scammers and unusual incidents are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Two notable incidents recently occurred:

### Kara Waifu

The Kara Waifu project launched and subsequently executed a "rug pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. All of the project's social media accounts were deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It was also highlighted that their drawings were copied from other projects on different blockchain chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### [[terabytes_nft_incident | Terabytes]]

The artist behind the [[terabytes_nft_incident | Terabytes]] project "went away" and deleted all social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. However, the artist donated all the money earned to the Angel Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Two theories circulated regarding the public's reaction to this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>:
*   Some claimed the public reacted negatively because the artwork was not considered "nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   Another story suggested that the artwork was generated using a "pixel dupe maker," a tool capable of creating pixel drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Both Kara Waifu and [[terabytes_nft_incident | Terabytes]] projects are now defunct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

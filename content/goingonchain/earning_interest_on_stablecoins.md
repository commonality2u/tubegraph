If you are looking for a platform to park your [[stablecoin_investment_options | stablecoin]] assets and earn interest, Finblox is an option to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Finblox Features and Rates

Finblox offers competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) on various crypto assets:
*   **USDC and USDT**: 15% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This rate is higher than what banks in Singapore offer for SGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   **SGD Coin (xSGD)**: 6.5% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. xSGD is a stablecoin by Strix, previously known as Xfres, which allows users to mint SGD into xSGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Other Cryptocurrencies**:
    *   Avalanche (AVAX): 8% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
    *   Polygon (MATIC): 20% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
    *   Axie Infinity Shards (AXS): 90% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

Interest on Finblox is paid daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Platform Access and User Experience

Currently, Finblox is accessible only via its mobile application; there is no web interface available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The app's interface for managing savings and crypto vaults is noted to be similar to Holdnaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Supported Blockchains and Fees

A significant advantage of Finblox is its integration with multiple blockchains, including Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This multi-chain support means transfer fees for deposits are generally much cheaper compared to platforms primarily using ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

For instance, depositing Polygon (MATIC) allows you to choose the Polygon chain directly, resulting in lower gas fees compared to an ERC20 transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, if you mint xSGD and transfer it to Finblox, the fees might still be based on the ERC20 standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Comparison with Holdnaut

Finblox offers several distinctions when compared to Holdnaut:

*   **Stablecoin APY**: Finblox provides 15% APY on USDT and USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Holdnaut's highest recent rate for USDT was 13.86% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Interest Tiers**: Holdnaut's interest rates are tiered, while Finblox does not appear to have tiered rates at the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Supported Chains**: Holdnaut primarily utilizes the ERC20 chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, whereas Finblox supports a wider array of chains, leading to potentially lower transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | Risks]]

The primary [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | risk]] associated with using Finblox is **platform risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Unlike Holdnaut, which has received in-principle approval from MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), indicating some level of vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, Finblox is a relatively new platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. At the time of a user's sign-up, there was no Know Your Customer (KYC) process required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

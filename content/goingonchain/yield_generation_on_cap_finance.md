CAP Finance is presented as a "degen low cap" protocol still considered a [[real_yield_in_defi | Real Yield]] protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The information shared is intended for knowledge sharing and is not financial advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## How CAP Finance Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
CAP Finance operates as a decentralized exchange for synthetic assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Currently, it supports trading for Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Traders on CAP Finance can use up to 50x leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Unlike traditional exchanges, traders on CAP Finance trade against a liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This pool is composed of ETH and USDC, acting as the counterparty to traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Source of Yield
The attractive yields offered on CAP Finance primarily come from traders' losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   If a trader wins, they take profit from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   If a trader loses, the asset goes into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   When a trader is liquidated, a partial amount of their asset also enters the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   Notably, if a trader loses, 100% of their position goes into the ETH and USDC pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This information was obtained from Discord, as it is not highlighted in the official documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Essentially, participants who provide liquidity to the pool act as "the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Yield Earning Opportunities
Users can generate yield on CAP Finance through two primary methods:

### 1. Providing Liquidity to Pools
By pooling ETH and USDC, users can earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Currently, the ETH pool offers approximately 69% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   The USDC pool offers approximately 34% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### 2. Staking CAP Token
Users holding and staking the native CAP token can earn around 11.5% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This is suitable for those bullish on the protocol's long-term potential, similar to GMX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, it's important to note that the CAP token currently offers no governance rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## [[risk_factors_in_cap_finance_pooling | Risk Factors]] in Pooling
While the yields are attractive, pooling funds on CAP Finance is not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Trader Wins:** In a scenario where a group of traders achieves significant wins, liquidity providers might not retrieve their full deposit as profits are taken from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This is a crucial consideration for those acting as market makers or "the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Fees and Lock-up:** Withdrawals incur a 1% fee for both the ETH and USDC pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Additionally, there is a 24-hour lock-up period after depositing, during which funds cannot be withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Yield:** The yield is dynamic and will decrease as more funds enter the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **No Stop Loss:** For traders, the platform lacks a stop-loss feature, and liquidation occurs at 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Market Positioning and Outlook
CAP Finance operates in the decentralized perpetual exchange space, alongside leaders like GMX and Gains Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. GMX and Gains are well-established and demonstrate strong trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

CAP Finance differentiates itself by aiming for zero trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The strategy is to build a flywheel effect: no fees attract more traders, leading to higher trading volume, and consequently, more liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

As of the transcript, CAP Finance has a market capitalization of approximately $12.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In terms of valuation, GMX has a P/E ratio of roughly 14.5, while CAP Finance's P/E ratio is around 9.87 based on current numbers and consideration of total revenue shares to holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Users can verify these numbers on Token Terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

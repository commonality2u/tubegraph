[[anchor_protocol_business_model | Anchor Protocol]] is a platform designed to facilitate peer-to-peer lending and borrowing [00:00:15]. It offers a high yield on stablecoin deposits, which can be an attractive feature for users.

## Interest for Lenders

Users who deposit funds into [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] as lenders can earn significant interest. The stated interest rate observed for depositors is approximately 19.53% [00:00:05], with the general range for lenders (e.g., "Alice") being between 19% to 20% in interest [00:00:19].

## Interest for Borrowers

Borrowers on [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | Anchor Protocol]] (e.g., "Bob") pay a floating interest rate [00:00:25]. In addition to paying interest, borrowers must provide crypto as [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] [00:00:23]. When this crypto is staked, it generates a staking reward [00:00:50]. Borrowers also receive [[ANC token as a reward | ANC tokens]] for borrowing money [00:00:29].

An example of a borrow Annual Percentage Rate (APR) observed was 21.55% [00:00:38]. The staking reward return rate has been observed around 5.83% [00:00:53].

## How High Yields are Maintained

The high yield provided to lenders on [[anchor_earn_interest_rate_changes | Anchor Protocol]] is maintained through a combination of the interest paid by borrowers and the staking rewards generated from borrowers' [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] [00:00:31].

### Example Calculation

Consider a scenario where:
*   Alice lends $1,000, expecting to receive 20% APR [00:01:02].
*   Bob borrows $1,000 using $3,000 of bLuna as [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] [00:00:56].

Based on these figures:
1.  **Bob's Borrowing Cost**: Bob pays an approximate 22% interest on his $1,000 loan, which amounts to $220 annually [00:01:06].
2.  **Staking Reward**: The $3,000 in [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] generates a staking reward, calculated at approximately 5% of the collateral value, yielding about $150 [00:01:10].
3.  **Total Collected**: The total amount collected from the borrower and collateral staking is $370 ($220 + $150) [00:01:13].
4.  **Distribution**: Out of the $370 collected, $200 goes to Alice (the lender's 20% interest on $1,000) [00:01:15], and the remaining $170 goes to the [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | Anchor yield reserve]] [00:01:17].

This mechanism illustrates how the platform can sustain high interest rates for lenders by pooling funds from both borrower payments and staking rewards. This process is a key aspect of decentralized finance [00:01:20].

The launch of [[SnowdogDAO overview and mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] had a noticeable impact on [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]], primarily due to liquidity movement between the two projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

## Liquidity Shift

When [[SnowdogDAO overview and mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] was introduced, there was a dump in the price of [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a>. This occurred because participants began moving their liquidity from [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] over to the new [[SnowdogDAO overview and mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

The team behind [[SnowdogDAO overview and mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] is the same anonymous team that released [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Despite the initial liquidity shift, [[snowbank_project_updates | Snowbank]] was noted to still be "going fine" at the time of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

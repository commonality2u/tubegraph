If an initial small investment doesn't yield promised results, they might provide a "lame excuse" and demand more capital to "trigger" the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This tactic exploits the victim's desire to recover their initial investment or achieve the promised returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Recognizing [[recognizing_red_flags_in_online_scams | Red Flags]]

Several indicators can help identify a potential scam:

*   **Unrealistic Promises**
    *   Offers that seem "too good to be true," such as guaranteed high returns, are often scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Suspicious Social Media Presence**
    *   Scam channels might have a large number of followers but very few videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Comments sections filled exclusively with positive feedback and no negative experiences are a strong [[recognizing_red_flags_in_online_scams | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This indicates that genuine negative comments are likely being filtered or removed, or the comments are fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Demands for More Money**
    *   If a platform or individual asks for additional funds after an initial investment fails to deliver, it is a clear sign of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Unverifiable Code/Scripts**
    *   Be cautious of scripts that require blind copying and pasting, especially if they interact with cryptocurrency wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Such code can be designed to secretly redirect funds to the scammer's wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

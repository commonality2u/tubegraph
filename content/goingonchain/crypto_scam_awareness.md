A common cryptocurrency scam tactic involves promising high returns through automated trading bots that claim to "front-run" transactions on decentralized exchanges like PancakeSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These scams often operate through dedicated YouTube channels or other social media platforms.

## How the Scam Operates

The scam typically begins with a YouTube channel promising that following a script will allow users to create a bot capable of front-running transactions on PancakeSwap, guaranteeing a significant profit, such as 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These channels often have a large number of followers and an abundance of positive comments, creating a deceptive sense of legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Victims are encouraged to engage with the scammers, often via [[social_media_and_telegram_scams | Discord]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. When a user tests the bot with a small amount of cryptocurrency, such as BNB, the bot predictably fails to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The scammer then provides a "lame excuse," claiming that insufficient funds were provided to trigger the front-running mechanism and demanding more capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This is a psychological trick designed to exploit the victim's desire to recover their initial investment and gain the promised profits, making them willing to invest more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Ultimately, any cryptocurrency sent to the bot or associated wallets is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Identifying Red Flags

Several red flags can help users recognize and avoid this type of [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | cryptocurrency scam]]:

*   **Disproportionate Engagement** A YouTube channel with a large number of followers (e.g., 12,000) but only one video is a significant red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Suspiciously Positive Comments** Comments that are "too good to be true" and entirely positive, with no negative feedback, indicate manufactured engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Unverifiable Code** The provided code or script for the bot often includes calls to an unknown [[how_to_recognize_scam_wallets | wallet address]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Copying and pasting code blindly without understanding its function can lead to funds being sent directly to the scammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Pressure for More Capital** A request for additional funds after an initial test fails is a clear sign of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Protection

To protect against these scams, it is crucial to:
*   Be skeptical of promises of guaranteed high returns.
*   Verify the legitimacy of channels and accounts.
*   Never blindly copy and paste code that you do not understand, especially if it interacts with your [[how_to_recognize_scam_wallets | crypto wallet]].
*   Share information about scams with friends to prevent them from falling victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Cidadao is a platform that integrates blockchain with real estate, distinct from other DeFi projects due to its backing by physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The core process for bringing properties on-chain and distributing tokens and rewards is called the "Introducing Real Estate On-chain" (IRO) process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Introducing Real Estate On-chain (IRO) Process

The IRO process is a 10-day period during which participants commit USDC into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. A minimum sum must be met for the IRO to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### IRO Success and Token Distribution
If the IRO is successful after the 10-day duration, participants' committed USDC is swapped for Real Estate Tokens (RET) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Along with the RET, participants receive rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The RET can be sold on Uniswap or used to earn "Knight," Cidadao's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Owning Knight provides exposure to other properties listed on the platform, as Cidadao receives 2% of all listed properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### IRO Failure and Refunds
If the minimum sum for the IRO is not met by the end of the 10-day period, the funds committed by participants are returned to them, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Participants are unable to withdraw their committed funds until the IRO is either successfully filled or fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## IRO Rewards

Rewards are distributed to participants in a successful IRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. These IRO rewards are given directly to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agents fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For the "Cardiff Building," the first project, the IRO value to be met is approximately 21 million, with an IRO reward pool of about 1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Reward Calculation Example
Cidadao provides an example for reward calculation:
*   **Scenario 1: Single Participant**
    *   If the fair value of a property is 100k and the daily reward is 1000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   If a participant commits 1000 on day one and no other participants join, they receive 100% of the 1000 reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2: Multiple Participants**
    *   If on day two, another participant (Bob) commits 9000, the initial participant would then receive only 10% of the reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency|Cryptocurrencies]] are a form of payment used for trading or exchanging items, and their operation is based on the concept of blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## What is Blockchain?
You can conceptualize blockchain as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. To maintain its integrity, validators are required to check on the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This validation process ensures that all transactions recorded on the blockchain are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Blockchain Algorithms
Within blockchain technology, there are two primary algorithms for validating transactions:
1.  Proof of Work (PoW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
2.  Proof of Stake (PoS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

### Proof of Work (PoW)
Proof of Work is the algorithm used to validate transactions on networks like the [[bitcoin|Bitcoin]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This method typically involves "[[bitcoin|Bitcoin]] mining," where individuals purchase specialized hardware and consume significant amounts of energy to validate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Proof of Stake (PoS)
Proof of Stake is increasingly favored by various protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a> because it eliminates the need for expensive hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> and avoids the energy consumption issues associated with Proof of Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. To gain control over a Proof of Stake network, one doesn't rely on computational power but rather needs to own 51% of the cryptocurrency on that specific network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens
In the realm of cryptocurrencies, there's a distinction between "coins" and "tokens":

### Coins
Coins refer to cryptocurrencies that operate on their own independent blockchain or "chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Examples include [[bitcoin|Bitcoin]], which runs on the [[bitcoin|Bitcoin]] network, and Ethereum, which operates on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Tokens
Tokens, such as USDC or RVNC, do not have their own independent blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Instead, they typically run on top of an existing chain, like USDC and DAI running on the Ethereum chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

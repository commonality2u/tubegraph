The video outlines a specific [[cryptocurrency_investment_approach | crypto strategy]] for 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This strategy focuses on accumulating core assets and leveraging them to invest in emerging sectors.

## Core Portfolio and Asset Accumulation
The presenter's current portfolio prominently features Luna, Ethereum (ETH), and Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The plan is to continue accumulating Luna and ETH throughout 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Instead of selling these assets, the strategy involves borrowing money against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This approach minimizes the need to inject significant fresh funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Luna**: UST can be borrowed using Luna from Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: ETH can be staked in Geist to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

These borrowed stablecoins are then utilized for further [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | investment]] in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This aligns with a [[treasury_and_asset_accumulation_strategy | treasury and asset accumulation strategy]] by continually leveraging existing holdings.

## Key Investment Areas for 2022
Three primary areas of interest for 2022 are identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>:

### 1. Ethereum Layer 2
Layer 2 solutions for Ethereum are expected to be a significant topic, especially in the first six months of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   "Smart money" is observed to be investing in Layer 2 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Centralized exchanges are integrating Layer 2 networks; for example, Binance added Arbitrum, and OKEx added ZK Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Specific interest lies in Optimistic Arbitrum One and ZK Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### 2. Metaverse Games and Gaming DAOs
While Metaverse token prices have recently decreased from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, games are considered crucial for driving crypto adoption, particularly those with DeFi elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   DeFi Kingdom is cited as an example of a game integrating DeFi, showing price growth even during bearish market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The focus shifts from direct game investment to **Gaming DAOs**, which function like talent agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. They recruit players, earn from games, and share profits, with a portion of revenue directed back to the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   Yield Guild Games (YGG) reported a treasury of 845 million as of September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   Current holdings include Mary Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Watchlist includes YGG SEA (a sub-DAO of YGG) and Avocado Guild (with an upcoming token launch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### 3. Multi-chain Ecosystems
The multi-chain narrative is another key area of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

A sub-portfolio was created with an initial investment of $1,000, allocated 40% to Time, 30% to Spell, and 30% to Ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

#### Specific Multi-chain Cryptocurrencies:
*   **Wonderland (TIME)**:
    *   The largest DAO with assets totaling $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Generates significant returns, approximately $144,000 daily or $52 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   Planned expansion to multi-chain operations starting in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Popsicle Finance (ICE)**:
    *   Focuses on yield optimization for Uniswap V3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Moving to Polygon, which is expected to bring a large influx of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Abracadabra.money (SPELL)**:
    *   Currently on BSC and soon expanding to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Known for its significant usage in managing internet money and generating substantial fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

This [[building_cryptocurrency_investment_portfolio | cryptocurrency investment portfolio]] strategy for 2022 combines a long-term holding of established assets with strategic re-investment into high-growth, emerging sectors, demonstrating a clear [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | investment strategies in a volatile market]] approach by leveraging assets rather than selling them. The focus on Layer 2, Metaverse DAOs, and multi-chain solutions indicates a forward-looking perspective on the crypto landscape.

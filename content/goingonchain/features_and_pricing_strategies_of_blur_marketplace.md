Blur is a new NFT marketplace and aggregator that provides a range of features aimed at NFT traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It offers real-time pricing and various tools to enhance the trading experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Key Features

*   **Aggregator Functionality**
    Blur acts as an aggregator, allowing users to concurrently list NFTs not only on Blur but also on other marketplaces like LooksRare and OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. As of the transcript's date, X2Y2 was temporarily disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Flexible Listing Prices**
    Users can easily set listing prices, with options to list at floor price, top trade, or use a ladder approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. There's also an auto-adjust feature for fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Zero Marketplace Fees**
    Blur does not impose a marketplace fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Pricing and Incentive Strategies

Blur employs unique strategies to encourage listing and platform engagement, primarily through optional royalties and loyalty points.

### [[incentivized_royalties_and_loyalty_points_on_blur | Incentivized Royalties]]
While it is optional to include royalty fees, Blur encourages users to do so through an incentivized royalty system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If a user chooses to give royalties, they are rewarded with Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategy aims to attract more listings, which in turn brings more users to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### [[incentivized_royalties_and_loyalty_points_on_blur | Loyalty Points]]
Each wallet on Blur has a loyalty point system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. If an NFT is listed on multiple marketplaces but is listed at the lowest price on Blur, the user receives higher loyalty points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Higher loyalty points increase the odds of receiving super rare care packages, which contain a greater quantity of Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Confirmed Airdrops

Blur has confirmed airdrops for its users, distributed through "care packages" that will later translate into Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Airdrop 1
Airdrop 1 was available to users who had traded NFTs in the last six months, with the allocation depending on their trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Different types of care packages exist, with legendary ones containing more Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Users had 14 days to claim Airdrop 1 from October 19th, with the collection period expected to end around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Airdrop 2
For those who missed Airdrop 1, Airdrop 2 is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To qualify, users need to list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

#### [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrop | Maximizing Airdrop 2]]
While there is no explicit formula, users can maximize their Airdrop 2 allocation by:
*   Listing more NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Listing blue-chip NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Listing NFTs from active collections, as these generate more trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The Blur tokens themselves are projected to be released in January 2023, with the current focus being on collecting care packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Cidadao is a platform designed to bring [[integration_of_blockchain_and_real_estate | blockchain and real estate]] together, distinguishing itself from other DeFi projects by being backed by physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The platform works by identifying commercial building owners interested in bringing their properties on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The IRO Process: Introducing Real Estate On-Chain

The core mechanism for tokenizing real estate on Cidadao is called "IRO," which stands for "Introducing Real Estate On-Chain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### How IRO Works
1.  **Commitment Period**: Participants commit USDC into a pool over a duration of typically 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  **Minimum Sum**: A minimum sum, known as the IRO value, must be met by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For the Cardiff Building project, this value is approximately $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
3.  **Success or Refund**:
    *   If the IRO is successful (the minimum sum is met), tokens and [[tangible_token_usage_and_rewards_system | rewards]] are distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    *   If the sum is not met, funds are returned to participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
4.  **IRO Rewards**: The project offers an IRO [[tangible_token_usage_and_rewards_system | reward]], which for the Cardiff Building is about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. These rewards are given directly to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The share of rewards depends on the percentage of total commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   _Note_: Committed funds cannot be withdrawn until the IRO outcome is determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Real Estate Token (RET)

The Real Estate Token (RET) is the [[nft_and_tokenization | token]] associated with a specific property brought on-chain.

*   **Acquisition**: Upon a successful IRO, the committed USDC is swapped for RET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: RET allows participants to gain exposure to the physical asset's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Usage**:
    *   RET can be sold on Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   It can also be used to earn Knight, Cidadao's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Knight Governance Token

Knight is the governance token for the Cidadao platform itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

*   **Acquisition**: Knight can be earned by utilizing RET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Ownership**:
    *   Owning Knight provides exposure to other properties listed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   The platform receives 2% of all properties listed on it, which likely contributes to the value or utility of Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example Project: Cardiff Building
> The first project on Cidadao is the Cardiff Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Details such as fair value, stable income, and rental income are highlighted on a dedicated page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The IRO value for this property is approximately $21 million, with an IRO reward of about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The IRO date is yet to be announced, but more information is available on their Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The unique aspect of Cidadao, with its physically-backed [[nft_and_tokenization | tokens]], makes it an interesting project in the DeFi space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

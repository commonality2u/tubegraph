Bitcoin is not backed by any physical assets or government bodies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This characteristic differentiates it from traditional assets like US Treasury bonds or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Due to its unbacked nature, Bitcoin has the potential to go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

A key strategy for 2022 involves borrowing money against existing crypto assets rather than selling them to acquire new funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This approach eliminates the need to bring in significant new capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This aligns with broader [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | cryptocurrency lending platforms]] and [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | strategies for earning interest]] on crypto assets.

## Process and Examples

Instead of directly selling assets like Luna or Ethereum (ETH), funds can be borrowed using these assets as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The stablecoin obtained through borrowing can then be invested elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Specific examples of this strategy include:
*   **Luna**: Borrowing UST using Luna as collateral through [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | Anchor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Depositing ETH into Geist to borrow stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The upcoming [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | Ethereum Merge]] is a significant event for the Ethereum blockchain, marking its full transition from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">00:31:31</a>. Despite common misconceptions, [[the_merge_on_ethereum | The Merge]] is not expected to reduce [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:23">01:23:23</a>.

## Why [[the_merge_on_ethereum | The Merge]] Will Not Lower Gas Fees

The primary reason [[the_merge_on_ethereum | The Merge]] will not lower [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fees]] is due to the specific layer of the blockchain it modifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">01:38:38</a>. Blockchains generally consist of three layers:
1.  **Execution Layer**: Where transactions are processed.
2.  **Consensus Layer**: Where network agreement on the state of the blockchain is achieved.
3.  **Data Availability Layer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:44">01:44:44</a>.

[[the_merge_on_ethereum | The Merge]] specifically changes the **consensus layer**, moving it from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">01:52:52</a>. However, when users pay [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fees]], they are paying for the resources used on the **execution layer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">02:00:00</a>. Since [[the_merge_on_ethereum | The Merge]] does not alter the execution layer, there will be no direct changes to transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">02:08:08</a>.

## Factors Influencing Gas Fees

[[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | Gas fees]] on a blockchain are primarily influenced by market dynamics and network conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">02:20:20</a>:

*   **Supply and Demand**: A blockchain effectively "sells" block space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">02:13:13</a>. If there is high demand from many users wanting to utilize that block space, the [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fee]] will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:20">02:20:20</a>. This was observed on networks like Fantom when user activity surged, causing [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fees]] to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">02:28:28</a>.
*   **Block Size**: After the London upgrade (around August 2021), Ethereum expanded its block size to be more variable, adapting to network needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">02:47:47</a>.
*   **Application Complexity**: The complexity of decentralized applications (dApps) being used also affects [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fees]]. More complex dApps require more transactions, leading to higher fee usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:01">03:01:01</a>.

These factors, related to the execution layer and network demand, are the primary determinants of [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | gas fees]], not the consensus mechanism change brought by [[the_merge_on_ethereum | The Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:11">03:11:11</a>.

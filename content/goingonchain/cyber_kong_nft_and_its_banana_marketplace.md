## Banana Utility

The existence of a market for bananas is driven by their utility within the Cyber Kong ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:

*   **Setting Biography**: Bananas are required to set a biography for a Cyber Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Renaming**: Renaming a Cyber Kong also requires bananas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Breeding**: Bananas are essential for breeding new "baby Kongs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

> [!caution] Investment Considerations
> Like other "farming tokens" such as honey from [[bear_deluxe_nft_and_honey_utility | Bear Deluxe NFTs]] or cheese from [[anonmine_nft_and_cheese_strategy | AnonMine NFTs]], the market for bananas can be subject to price fluctuations if users decide to dump their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. It is crucial for potential investors to conduct their own research before making any decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

[[overview_of_bend_dao | Bend Dao]] is a lending and borrowing platform designed for NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The platform allows users to deposit their NFTs and borrow ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, or supply ETH to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Overview of Yields

As of the transcript, users supplying ETH on [[overview_of_bend_dao | Bend Dao]] could earn a total of 77% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This includes 72% earnings in ETH plus the platform token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Borrowing ETH with NFTs

When borrowing ETH with an NFT on [[overview_of_bend_dao | Bend Dao]], users currently face a significant interest rate of minus 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This high borrowing interest rate is primarily due to a lack of sufficient ETH supply for deposits on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The platform accepts only seven selected blue-chip NFTs as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The platform also facilitates buying NFTs at a discount through a "down payment" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For example, a MAYC with a full price of 14.6 ETH could be acquired for 11.05 ETH, with the remaining amount considered a loan from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While the loan can be paid back at any time, interest will accrue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Supplying ETH for Yield

Supplying ETH is the method to earn a high APR on [[overview_of_bend_dao | Bend Dao]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The utilization rate for supplied ETH is approximately 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Considerations for Lenders

A high utilization rate, such as the 95% seen on [[overview_of_bend_dao | Bend Dao]], implies a potential issue for lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It means that while lending can earn significant yield, there might be difficulties in withdrawing or retrieving the lent ETH due to its high utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

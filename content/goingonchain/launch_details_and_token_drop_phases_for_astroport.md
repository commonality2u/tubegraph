From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

[[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]], a next-generation Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Terra, is undergoing auditing and is slated for launch around mid-November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Unlike traditional Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs), [[initial_nft_offering_and_launch_strategy | Astroport]] will implement a "token drop" strategy, structured into three distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Token Distribution
[[tokenomics_of_astroport_including_token_distribution_and_subtokens | Astroport's token distribution]] allocates 55% of tokens to liquidity pool providers over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The team and investors will receive 30% of tokens over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Additionally, [[tokenomics_of_astroport_including_token_distribution_and_subtokens | Astroport]] will feature two other subtokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Token Drop Phases
The token drop is designed to incentivize participation and migration within the Terra ecosystem:

1.  **DeFi Participation/Terra Farming** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
    *   Tokens will be distributed to users who have participated in Terra's DeFi ecosystem, likely through farming activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Specific details regarding eligibility criteria were not explicitly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
2.  **Terraswap Liquidity Migration** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
    *   Users providing liquidity on [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] are encouraged to migrate their liquidity to [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Tokens will be awarded to those who make this transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
3.  **Astroport UST Pool Commitment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
    *   Tokens acquired from the first two phases can be committed into the [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] UST pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This commitment allows users to earn even more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Lockup Periods
Phases two and three of the token drop will include lockup periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Users will have the option to choose their preferred lockup duration directly within the user interface, similar to a vesting schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

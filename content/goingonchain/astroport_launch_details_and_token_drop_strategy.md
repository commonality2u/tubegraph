Astroport is an AMM on Terra that had not yet launched at the time of the transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Launch Timeline and Method
Astroport was undergoing auditing and was anticipated to launch around mid-November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Unlike traditional [[initial_nft_offering_launch_method | Initial NFT Offering (INO)]] or Initial DEX Offerings (IDOs), Astroport utilized a token drop mechanism for its distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Token Drop Strategy
The [[tokenomics_and_distribution_for_astroport | token drop]] is structured into three distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>:

### Phase 1: DeFi Participation
Individuals who participated in DeFi on Terra were eligible for an initial distribution of tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. While specific details were not provided, it was suggested that those engaged in farming activities on Terra would receive a share of the tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Phase 2: Terraswap Liquidity Migration
Astroport invited users who provided liquidity on [[comparison_between_astroport_and_terraswap | Terraswap]] to migrate their liquidity to Astroport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Tokens were awarded to users who moved their liquidity over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Phase 3: Astroport UST Pool Commitment
Tokens earned from Phase 1 and Phase 2 could be committed to the Astroport UST pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This commitment allowed users to earn even more tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Lockup Period
For participants in Phase 2 and Phase 3 of the token drop, a lockup period was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Users had the flexibility to choose the duration of this lockup period within the user interface, similar to a vesting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

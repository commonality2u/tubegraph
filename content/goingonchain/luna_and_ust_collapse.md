The LUNA and UST collapse was a "super tough" event for many investors, leading to liquidations and significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One individual's LUNA position was liquidated, resulting in an "empty" bag, requiring them to recover and start from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Despite the pain, there's a continued belief in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Downfall

The downfall of LUNA was attributed to several converging factors:

### Coordinated Attack
A key factor was a "coordinated attack" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Attackers acquired 1 billion UST, which they then loaned for 3 billion BTC, and subsequently sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This action caused a bank run on [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]] as it triggered a UST depeg, leading to widespread panic selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Terra's UST Mechanism
The design of the [[ust_mechanism_and_its_impact_on_luna | Terra UST mechanism]] played a critical role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. When users sell UST, new LUNA is minted, increasing its supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This created a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle": the more people sold UST, the more LUNA was minted, further driving down LUNA's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### LFG's Bitcoin Reserves
The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) held a reserve of Bitcoin intended to stabilize UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, their continuous selling of BTC to try and stabilize UST led to panic across the entire crypto market, further exacerbating the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Broader Market and Macroeconomic Events
The collapse occurred amidst challenging macroeconomic conditions, including high inflation and negative economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Adding to the pressure, the Treasury Secretary commented on UST, calling for regulation, which intensified market concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Aftermath and Current State

As a result of these factors, UST depegged, and the price of LUNA plummeted to less than 10 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Terra's stated priority was to restore the UST peg over LUNA's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This strategy involved continued burning (of UST to restore peg) which implicitly leads to more LUNA production and a further decline in LUNA's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

The broader market also felt the impact, with Bitcoin continuing its decline due to large sell-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Even USDT, another stablecoin, briefly lost its peg during this tumultuous period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Attacker's Perspective
A Twitter thread from one of the attackers, detailing their "victory lap," is available for those interested in understanding their perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | Crypto lending platforms]] function similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services, such as Funding Societies or MoolahSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. On these platforms, individuals can participate as either a lender or a borrower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

As a lender, you provide funds and, in return, receive interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As a borrower, you deposit crypto assets as collateral to obtain a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Your deposited crypto is returned once the loan and its associated interest are repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Platforms and Their [[features_and_fees_of_crypto_lending_platforms | Features]]

Three platforms commonly discussed are BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Holdnaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### BlockFi
BlockFi is a well-known platform regulated in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Interest Payouts:** Interest is paid monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Lock-in/Minimums:** There is no lock-in period and no minimum sum required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Fees:** BlockFi charges withdrawal fees, though they offer one free crypto withdrawal and one free stablecoin withdrawal per calendar month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Additional withdrawals incur a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Example [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | Earnings]]:** Lending $10,000 in a stablecoin like USDC can yield approximately $860 in interest over one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, which is significantly higher than traditional bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Celsius Network
Celsius Network is headquartered in London and offers a wider selection of coins for lending and borrowing compared to BlockFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Interest Payouts:** Payouts are weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Lock-in/Minimums:** No lock-in period and no minimum sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Fees:** Celsius Network does not charge withdrawal fees, making it a very attractive option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Promotions:** They offer a $50 BTC bonus for new sign-ups who transfer $400 or more into the platform and hold it for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Holdnaut

## [[risks_associated_with_new_investment_platforms | Risks]] and Considerations

Despite the attractive [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest rates]] offered by [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | crypto lending platforms]], it is crucial to consider the inherent [[risks_associated_with_decentralized_finance_defi_and_centralized_finance_cefi | risks]] involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Platform Failure:** If a platform like Celsius Network were to fail, any funds held on it would likely be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This highlights the importance of understanding the [[understanding_the_sources_of_crypto_yield_and_associated_risks | sources of crypto yield and associated risks]].
*   **Not Financial Advice:** It is important to conduct your own research and make independent investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Recommendations for Potential Users
*   **Lending Existing Crypto:** If you already hold cryptocurrencies, consider lending them out to earn passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Stablecoins:** For those new to crypto lending or seeking less volatility, consider purchasing stablecoins like USDT or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by fiat currencies like the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They offer significantly higher [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest rates]] compared to traditional savings accounts at banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

*Note: The interest rates mentioned are accurate as of June 20, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.*

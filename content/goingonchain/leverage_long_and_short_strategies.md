Leverage long and short strategies are methods to potentially amplify returns on Hundred Finance, a [[borrowing_and_lending_strategies | lending and borrowing]] platform that operates multi-chain, often used on the Fantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Leverage Long Strategy

To execute a [[AVAX and leveraging strategies | leverage long]] strategy on Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>:
1.  Supply a crypto asset as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
2.  Borrow a stablecoin using the supplied crypto asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
3.  Use the borrowed stablecoin to buy more of the crypto asset you want to long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

**Example**:
If you hold Ether (ETH) and wish to [[AVAX and leveraging strategies | long]] ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>:
1.  Supply ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
2.  Borrow USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
3.  Take the USDC to a decentralized exchange (DEX) and buy more ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
4.  If the price of ETH increases, sell a portion of your ETH holdings for stablecoin to repay the loan, and the difference is your gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Leverage Short Strategy

To execute a [[AVAX and leveraging strategies | leverage short]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>:
1.  Supply a stablecoin or a crypto asset as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  Borrow the crypto asset you intend to short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  Sell the borrowed crypto asset for a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

**Example**:
If you hold ETH and wish to [[AVAX and leveraging strategies | short]] Bitcoin (BTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>:
1.  Supply ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  Borrow BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
3.  Go to a DEX and swap the borrowed BTC for a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  When the price of BTC goes down, withdraw the stablecoins and use them to buy back BTC at a lower price to repay the loan, earning the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Hundred Finance provides documentation with numerical examples on how to perform both [[AVAX and leveraging strategies | leverage long]] and [[AVAX and leveraging strategies | leverage short]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. These strategies are examples of the diverse ways to earn yield within DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

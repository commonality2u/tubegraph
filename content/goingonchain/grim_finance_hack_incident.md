### DeFi Insurance Options

*   **InsurAce**: This platform is mentioned as a potential option for buying insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While it did not cover Grim Finance, it provides coverage for other protocols within the Fantom ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For example, if a user has a large position in Abracadabra, they could purchase insurance against a potential hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Anchor Protocol Insurance**: The user personally buys Anchor Protocol insurance, though it is noted that this coverage often runs out quickly, requiring frequent checks for availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A referral code for discounts on insurance purchases may be made available in the comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

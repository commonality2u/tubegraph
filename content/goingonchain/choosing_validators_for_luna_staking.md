## Accessing Validators

You can find a list of validators by going to your [[using_terra_wallet_for_staking_operations | Terra wallet]] and clicking on "staking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This list is typically sorted by uptime by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. You can change the sorting criteria to uptime, commission, or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. There are 105 validators available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Validator Selection

When choosing a validator, several factors should be taken into account:

### 1. Voting Power

It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This advice aims to prevent the concentration of power among a few entities, promoting decentralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, a validator like Orion might have a voting power of six percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. You can choose to stake partially with one validator (e.g., if you are interested in a specific airdrop) and partially with others to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### 2. Self-Delegation

Self-delegation refers to the amount of LUNA that validators have staked themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This acts as an indicator of their "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. A higher self-delegation amount is generally preferable, indicating a stronger commitment from the validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### 3. Commission

Commission is the percentage of your earned rewards that the validator takes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When possible, look for validators that offer a 0% commission rate to maximize your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### 4. Uptime

A validator's uptime indicates how consistently they are online and performing their duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It is crucial to choose validators with 100% uptime, as you will not earn rewards if the validator is not operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Staking Your LUNA

Once you have selected a validator, you can proceed with the staking process:
1. Click "delegate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2. Input the desired amount of LUNA you wish to stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3. Click "next" and then "go" to complete the delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

After delegating, you will be able to view a summary of your staked amount and the rewards you are earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. In addition to LUNA rewards, you may also be eligible for special [[collecting_terra_luna_airdrops | airdrops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. To check and [[collecting_terra_luna_airdrops | collect airdrops]], visit terrasmartstake.io, input your Terra address, and scroll down to see any available unclaimed airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

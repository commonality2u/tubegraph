To achieve [[using_stablecoins_and_other_exchanges_for_better_rates | better rates]] when bridging UST to other chains, such as AVAX, one can utilize software called Satellite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This method allows for transferring UST to different chains where farming opportunities might be available, such as an AVAX pool offering up to 56% yield, or a stablecoin pool yielding around 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Transfer Process with Satellite

The process for using Satellite involves several steps:

1.  **Select Source Chain and Asset**: Choose "Terra" as the source chain and "UST" as the source asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  **Specify Destination**: Input "AVAX" as the destination chain and provide your AVAX address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Transfer**: Click "connect wallet and transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This action will prompt a signature request on your MetaMask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Signing this generates a one-time deposit for the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Fees and Minimums

*   **Transfer Fee**: A transfer fee of 0.1% applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Minimum Transfer**: The minimum transfer amount is 15 UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Wallet Interactions

A key step involves using the Keeper wallet, which is part of the Cosmo ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. You must transfer your UST from your Terra Station wallet to the Keeper wallet before initiating the Satellite transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

1.  **Move UST to Keeper**: Ensure the desired amount of UST is in your Keeper wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Approve Transaction**: The transfer process will trigger your Keeper wallet for approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Sending this transaction costs approximately 0.004 LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Completion and Post-Transfer Use

After approving the transaction, it typically takes three to five minutes for the transfer to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Once finished, your UST will appear in your MetaMask wallet on the AVAX network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

With the UST on AVAX, you can then proceed to platforms like Pangolin to deposit and participate in stablecoin farming opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

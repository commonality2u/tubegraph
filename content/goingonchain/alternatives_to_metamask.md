While many cryptocurrency users primarily utilize Metamask, given its status as one of the earliest [[types_of_crypto_wallets | wallets]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, the advancement of crypto has led to an increase in available wallet options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Here are three alternatives:

## Brave Wallet

Brave Wallet is notable for being built directly into the Brave browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This integration means users do not need to download an extra Chrome extension, which can reduce risks to the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

*   **User Interface and Connectivity** The wallet features a visually appealing user interface (UI) and connects to various chains, similar to Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It also includes a portfolio page that pulls price data from Coingecko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Weaknesses** Its coin tracker is not as robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It struggles to track LP tokens, requiring manual addition by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Additionally, new or certain tokens may not be automatically recognized; for example, the cre8r token had to be added manually, despite Metamask automatically displaying it upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Rabby Wallet

Developed by Debank, Rabby Wallet is a Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While it aims to provide a smooth multi-chain experience, it can sometimes misidentify the active chain, such as thinking it's on a different chain when visiting a Fantom site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Security Feature** A significant strength of Rabby Wallet is its "Security" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This allows users to view a list of all token approvals they have granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For instance, it can show if USDC has been given unlimited access ("infinite") to many Fantom protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This feature highlights the risk of infinite approvals, where a compromised project could affect all user funds, whether it's $3,000 or $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Users can also decline approvals for unknown projects, a functionality not available in Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Argent Wallet

Argent is a smart wallet, meaning it is built on a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Currently, it supports Ethereum (ETH) and Layer 2 ZKsync networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Activating the wallet requires a one-time gas fee because of its smart contract nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is particularly useful for storing NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   **Key Features**
    *   **No Seed Phrase** Users do not need to remember a seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Login is managed via email and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, with the seed phrase securely split and encrypted between Argent and iCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   **Guardian Feature** Argent includes a "Guardian" feature, allowing users to designate a trusted person, like a spouse, as a guardian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. If a user's phone is lost, the guardian can remotely lock the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This security setup is a primary reason for its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

[[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] is a cross-chain money market protocol that has quickly risen to prominence on the Arbitrum chain, ranking among its top protocols with significant Total Value Locked (TVL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While offering typical money market functionalities like lending assets to earn yield and borrowing against collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, [[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | Radiant Capital]] introduces an interesting iteration on the lending protocol, particularly in its borrowing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:21">[03:06:21]</a>.

## Traditional Borrowing Limitations

Typically, when a user borrows assets on a specific blockchain, such as Phantom, the borrowed assets are confined to that chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:09">[03:08:09]</a>. If there's an urgent need for those stablecoins on a different chain, like Polygon, the user would traditionally have to bridge the assets over manually, which can be a multi-step process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Radiant Capital's Cross-Chain Borrowing Solution

[[functionality_and_benefits_of_radiant_capital | Radiant Capital]] introduces a unique feature that allows for **cross-chain borrowing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This means a user can deposit collateral on one chain (e.g., Arbitrum) and borrow an asset that is then bridged directly to another specified chain (e.g., Polygon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. For example, if a user needs stablecoins on Polygon, they can borrow them on Arbitrum via [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] and have them bridged directly to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This streamlines the process of accessing liquidity across different blockchain networks, eliminating the need for manual bridging after borrowing.

## Powered by Stargate

This innovative cross-chain borrowing functionality within [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] is enabled by its integration with Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

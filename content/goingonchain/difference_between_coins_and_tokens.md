The terms "coins" and "tokens" are both used to refer to cryptocurrencies, but they have distinct differences, primarily related to their underlying blockchain infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[01:07]</a>.

## Coins
Coins are cryptocurrencies that operate on their own independent blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[01:10]</a>. They function on their own dedicated network, similar to how Bitcoin runs on the Bitcoin network, and Ethereum runs on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[01:14]</a>.

## Tokens
Tokens are cryptocurrencies that do not possess their own independent blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[01:23]</a>. Instead, they are built and operate on top of existing blockchain networks. Examples include USDC and RVNC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[01:23]</a>. For instance, USDC and DAI run on top of the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[01:28]</a>.

Cryptocurrencies can generally be categorized into two main types: coins and tokens. The primary distinction lies in whether they operate on their own independent blockchain or utilize an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>.

## Coins
[[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | Coins]] are a form of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrency]] that operate on their own dedicated blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. This means they run on their own independent network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
Examples include:
*   **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Runs on the Bitcoin network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
*   **Ethereum (ETH)**: Runs on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Tokens
[[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | Tokens]] are another type of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Unlike coins, [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | tokens]] do not operate on their own independent blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Instead, they are built and run on top of an existing blockchain, leveraging its infrastructure and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

Examples of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | tokens]] include:
*   [[types_of_stablecoins | USDC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>
*   [[types_of_stablecoins | DAI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>
*   RVNC (as mentioned in the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>

For instance, [[types_of_stablecoins | USDC]] and [[types_of_stablecoins | DAI]] are [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | tokens]] that function on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

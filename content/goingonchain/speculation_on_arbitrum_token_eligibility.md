From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

There is significant [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation]] surrounding a potential token airdrop from Arbitrum, similar to the one executed by [[optimism_and_arbitrum_airdrops | Optimism]] (OP) for its early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is widely believed that Arbitrum will also launch a token and require specific tasks to qualify early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Arbitrum Odyssey Program

Originally, Arbitrum introduced a program called [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] to identify early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This program involved several tasks, such as [[bridging_to_arbitrum | bridging]] assets to Arbitrum, which would reward participants with an [[nft_incentives_from_bridging_on_arbitrum | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] was intended to be an eight-week initiative with weekly tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, it was halted prematurely due to excessive network traffic and a spike in gas prices, driven by the intense [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation]] about a future airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Nitro Upgrade and Odyssey's Fate

To address the network congestion, Arbitrum introduced the [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro upgrade]], designed to handle more traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The [[nitro_upgrade_for_arbitrum | Nitro upgrade]] went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite the upgrade, the [[arbitrum_odyssey_program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] did not resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For those who wish to complete the [[arbitrum_odyssey_bridging_strategies | Odyssey task]] from the past, it now requires purchasing an NFT on the secondary market via OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Current "Quest to Earn Roles" Program

Currently, there is another program that involves quests to earn roles on Arbitrum's Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While officially stated as a way to gain Discord roles, this program is also a source of [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation]] for potential token eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Despite the official messaging, approximately 50,000 individuals are participating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Participation Details

*   **Cost**: Participating in this program costs around 0.02 ETH plus gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Platform**: The tasks are managed through guild.xyz/Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Requirements**: To begin, users must connect their wallet, Discord account, and Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Tasks**: Tasks involve purchasing small amounts of specific tokens (e.g., 0.01 JMX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Token Acquisition**: Most required tokens can be acquired on Uniswap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Safety Precaution**: When purchasing tokens, it is crucial to copy the contract address from an explorer (like Etherscan) and paste it into the decentralized exchange (e.g., Uniswap) to avoid scam tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Directly pasting token names can lead to selecting fraudulent tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Upon completing the tasks and making the necessary token purchases, the Guild.xyz platform will refresh, granting access to the corresponding Discord roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Completing all tasks can take approximately 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

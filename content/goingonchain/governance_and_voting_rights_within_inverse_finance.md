Inverse Finance recently upgraded its governance token to [[inverse_finance_governance_token_upgrade | Inverse Plus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This upgrade aims to add more value to the governance token, moving beyond simple voting utility, and is described as a "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Role of IMV and xIMV Tokens

Holding and staking the IMV token is central to participating in Inverse Finance's governance. When users deposit IMV into Inverse Finance, they receive xIMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This xIMV token confers several benefits:
*   **IMV Emission**: Holders receive IMV emissions, which are distributed per Ethereum block (approximately 6,400 times a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The cap for this emission is 500% APY and can only be altered through a new governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. There is no maximum supply for the IMV token, but the DAO can introduce a cap to cease minting if emissions are too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Voting Rights**: xIMV grants holders voting rights within the Inverse Finance governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Collateral for Stablecoin Borrowing**: Uniquely, xIMV can be used as collateral to borrow the project's stablecoin, DOLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This feature allows for capital efficiency, as the staked IMV continues to earn its APY even while used as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## On-Chain Governance Process

Inverse Finance utilizes an active on-chain voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The governance page demonstrates active polls, with 35 proposals initiated and 32 successfully passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The recent [[inverse_plus_tokenomics_and_value_proposition | Inverse Plus]] upgrade itself was passed through this on-chain voting mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The project emphasizes transparency, providing a transparency tab that details smart contract links and their interactions, similar to reading a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

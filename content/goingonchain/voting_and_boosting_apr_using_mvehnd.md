Hundred Finance, a multichain lending and borrowing protocol, has introduced a significant development that allows users to leverage their locked [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] across different chains to [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boost rewards]] and APRs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Hundred Finance Overview

Hundred Finance operates as a multichain lending and borrowing protocol, available on eight different chains, with Polygon being the latest addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. On Hundred Finance, users can:
*   Stake assets to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, staking $500 could earn a 26% yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Supply assets to be used as collateral for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Participate in backstop provision, which involves supplying assets for liquidation to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Yield is earned in [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | HND tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Earning and Using mveHND

Once [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | HND tokens]] are earned, they can be locked up and converted into [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | mveHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The primary utility of [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | mveHND]] is to vote for specific liquidity pools to [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boost the APR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

For instance, to achieve a high APR like 86% on FRAX, users need to [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | lock enough HND tokens]] to get the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. A user staking $500 could [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | lock up]] 300 [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | HND tokens]] for four years to achieve a 1.5x boost, or increase it to 1000 [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | HND tokens]] to get the maximum 2.5x boost, thus [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | earning more rewards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Mirroring Event

Hundred Finance recently completed its first "mirroring event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This development allows users to take their [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | locked veHND]] from one chain (e.g., FTM) and mirror it over to another chain (e.g., Polygon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This eliminates the need for "double locking" on different chains, which was a previous downside for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Users can now simply mirror their [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | mveHND]] and use it to vote and [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boost their APR]] on the destination chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For example, a user's mirrored [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | mveHND]] could provide a 1.07x boost for a USDC pool on Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero service for this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Currently, [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | mveHND]] mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While not all mirroring directions are fully ready, mirroring from Fantom to Polygon is functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### How to Mirror veHND

From the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom), users can find a "Mirror" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. They simply choose the desired destination chain, click mirror, and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This mirroring capability significantly incentivizes users to engage with Hundred Finance across multiple chains, as their existing [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | locked veHND]] can be immediately utilized to [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boost APRs]] on different pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

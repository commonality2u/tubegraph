For individuals looking to [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | earn interest on stablecoins]], platforms like Finblox and Hodlnaut offer varying rates and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Finblox

Finblox currently offers a 15% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on USD Coin (USDC) and Tether (USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They also support SGD Coin (xSGD), providing a 6.5% APY, a rate significantly higher than traditional Singaporean banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. xSGD is issued by Strix (formerly known as Xfiniti) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, and users can mint SGD into xSGD on their platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

In addition to stablecoins, Finblox offers competitive rates for other cryptocurrencies, including 8% for Avalanche, 20% for Polygon (MATIC), and 90% for Axie Infinity Shards (AXS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Interest on Finblox is paid daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The platform is currently only accessible via its mobile application, with no web interface available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Its interface is similar to Hodlnaut, featuring a saving vault and crypto vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Supported Networks and Fees

Finblox integrates with multiple blockchain networks, including Solana, BNB Chain, and Polygon, which results in significantly cheaper transfer fees compared to platforms primarily using ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. However, minting xSGD and depositing it into Finblox still involves ERC20 fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For Polygon (MATIC) deposits, users can choose the Polygon network directly, leading to lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Hodlnaut

Hodlnaut offers a highest rate of 13.86% for USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Interest on Hodlnaut is paid weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Unlike Finblox, Hodlnaut's interest rates are tiered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Hodlnaut primarily utilizes the ERC20 chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | Risk Management]]

The primary risk associated with these platforms is platform risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Hodlnaut has received in-principle approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), suggesting a level of vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Finblox, however, is a newer platform and did not require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification upon sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. These factors are part of the [[regulatory_implications_and_future_of_stablecoins | regulatory implications]] to consider for [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | cryptocurrency investment strategies]].

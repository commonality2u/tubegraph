[[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] is a prominent cross-chain money market protocol, currently ranked among the top 10 protocols on the Arbitrum Chain, holding the sixth position with close to $54 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It has quickly gained attention from yield farmers due to its impressive yields, including a locking APR of 100% and an LP APR of 542% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Addressing Initial Concerns and Updates

Initially, there were [[concerns_and_updates_on_radiant_capital | concerns]] about [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] regarding unaudited contracts, lack of KYC, no time lock, an association with Sifu, and LP snipers at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, the team has issued statements and subsequently made significant updates to address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>:
*   Oracle ownership has been moved to a Tutor multi-sig <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   A time lock has been added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   The contract is now verified and audited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Regarding KYC, the team clarified their stance, aligning with Offchain Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Core Functionality of a Money Market

As a cross-chain money market, [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] facilitates several key use cases and [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | strategies]] for users:

### Lending Assets
Users can deposit their assets, such as Ethereum (ETH), to earn yield. For instance, depositing ETH can yield 2.54% on the ETH itself, plus an additional 5.61% APR in [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] token incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These percentages are dynamic and subject to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Borrowing Assets
Users can borrow assets by using their deposited assets as collateral. For example, if a user is bullish on ETH but lacks stablecoins, they can deposit ETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins like USDC. This allows them to avoid selling their ETH while increasing leverage, though leverage carries inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Borrowing USDC, for instance, might incur a 3.63% cost but also provide a 5.31% APR in incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Looping for Yield Farming
A common strategy for yield farmers is "looping," where stablecoins are used to farm more platform tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Traditionally a manual process involving repeated deposits and borrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] streamlines this with a "one-click" looping feature. For example, using DAI with a leverage of 4 (equivalent to looping four times) can result in a net APY of 32.88%, factoring in borrowing costs and a reward APR of around 41.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Unique Features and Benefits

### [[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | Cross-Chain Borrowing]]
[[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] introduces a significant innovation in borrowing: [[radiant_capitals_unique_crosschain_borrowing_feature | cross-chain borrowing]]. Unlike other money markets where borrowed assets are confined to the chain they were borrowed on, [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] allows users to borrow on one chain (e.g., Arbitrum) and bridge the asset to another (e.g., Polygon) if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This unique functionality is enabled by integrating with Stargate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Incentives and Tokenomics
[[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] features a specific [[investment_strategies_and_tokenomics_of_radiant_capital | incentive model]] for its token:
*   **Vested Rewards**: All yields earned from lending, borrowing, and LP provision are vested for 28 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Users can choose to break the vesting early, but they will only receive 50% of their rewards, with the remaining 50% going to the [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] token lockers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Token Locking**: Users can lock their tokens to earn both platform and penalty fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This mechanism, similar to [[cap_finance_platform_overview | Gaias Finance]] on FTM, means locked tokens cannot be unstaked at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The APR for locking can be as high as 800% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Platform Fees**: These fees are generated from user borrowing costs and are distributed in a variety of assets, including stablecoins, ETH, and wBTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Providing (LP) Rewards**: The APR for providing liquidity is about 542% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>, though users should be mindful of impermanent loss risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This high APR is due to 20% of the [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] token emissions being allocated to pool rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Token Allocation**: Approximately 70% of the tokens are used for incentives, with 50% going to supply and borrowing, and 20% to pool 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Unlock Schedule**: Most token unlocks occur within a 24-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

The evolution of [[features_and_fees_of_crypto_lending_platforms | lending protocols]] like [[radiant_capital_overview_and_status | Radiant Capital]] showcases interesting iterations in decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

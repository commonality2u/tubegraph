The backstop provision is one method to earn yield on platforms like Hundred Finance, which operates as a [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | compound-form]] platform for [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency_lending_platforms | lending and borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:98">[00:22:98]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:39">[01:44:39]</a>

Instead of simply lending out USDC, users can participate in the backstop provision by providing liquidity to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>. This liquidity is then used by the platform to execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:95">[01:57:95]</a>.

## Potential Yield

By participating in the backstop provision and providing USDC, users can earn an estimated annual percentage rate (APR) of around 8.79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>. This is considered a way to earn yield on Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:94">[04:20:94]</a>.

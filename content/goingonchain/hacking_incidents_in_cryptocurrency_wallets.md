Recent events highlight the critical need for robust [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security features]] when managing cryptocurrency. Wallet hacking incidents are a significant concern within the crypto space, leading to substantial financial losses for individuals and institutions alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Notable Hacking Incidents

Several high-profile cases demonstrate the vulnerabilities present in various types of crypto wallets:
*   **Defiance Capital Founder**: The founder of Defiance Capital experienced a major loss of 1.6 million in a [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallet]] hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He primarily used his mobile phone for transactions and later suspected the cause was a [[crypto_scam_awareness | phishing attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **MetaMask Chrome Extension**: A user's MetaMask Chrome extension was compromised, resulting in a loss of $400 worth of Ether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **NFT Phishing Attack**: A separate incident saw $1.7 million in NFTs stolen through a [[crypto_scam_awareness | phishing attack]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

These incidents underscore various methods of compromise, including laptop compromises, [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | scams]], and signing malicious transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Types of Crypto Wallets and Their Security

The ongoing debate on social media platforms like Twitter often centers on the security differences between [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallets]] and [[types_of_crypto_wallets | cold wallets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Hot Wallets
[[types_of_crypto_wallets | Hot wallets]] are cryptocurrency wallets that are constantly connected to the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Examples**: MetaMask and [[trust_wallet_app_risks | Trust Wallet]] are common examples of [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Risk**: While convenient for frequent transactions, [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallets]] on mobile phones are generally considered not safe enough due to their online connectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Cold Wallets
[[types_of_crypto_wallets | Cold wallets]], or hardware wallets, are not connected to the internet, providing an enhanced layer of [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Example**: A Ledger hardware device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Enhanced Security**: When a [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallet]] like MetaMask is used with a Ledger, it essentially functions as a [[types_of_crypto_wallets | cold wallet]] because transactions must be physically signed and approved on the hardware device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This provides a crucial step in preventing unauthorized transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Limitation**: Even with a hardware device, if the user signs a malicious contract, the hardware cannot protect against user error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Ledger devices typically cost around $200, though discounts may be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Wallet Security

Beyond choosing between hot and cold wallets, users can adopt several strategies to enhance their crypto [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]].

### Using Multiple Wallet Addresses
A common strategy is to own multiple wallet addresses, each serving a specific purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For example:
*   One for trading and DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   One for buying NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   One for storing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   One for testing out new platforms or protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Argent Smart Wallet

[[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | Argent]] is highlighted as a "smart wallet" that offers advanced [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security features]] not typically found in standard wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Unlike traditional wallets, [[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | Argent]] is a smart contract wallet, meaning its functionality is written on a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Its contracts are open source, allowing technical users to review them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

#### Key Security Features of Argent
[[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | Argent]]'s smart contract nature allows for programmable [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]] controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>:
*   **Multisig (Guardians)**: Users can set up "guardians" who act as third-party signers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. These guardians can help:
    *   Approve transactions that exceed a user-set limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Assist in wallet recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   Instantly lock the wallet if a mobile phone is compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Transfer Limits**: Set daily or per-transaction transfer limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Approved Addresses**: Specify a whitelist of trusted addresses for sending funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Token Allowance**: Control how much of a specific token can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### User Experience and Functionality
[[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | Argent]] works with WalletConnect and primarily supports Ethereum and ZK Sync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. It offers integrated DeFi functionalities:
*   **In-wallet Swapping**: Allows users to trade tokens directly within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Staking Integration**: Enables staking, e.g., ETH2 staking via Lido <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Index Funds and Stablecoin Yields**: Provides options to invest in index funds (powered by Index Coop) and earn yields on stablecoins from protocols like Yearn, Aave, or Zerion Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This brings DeFi directly to the user, eliminating the need to search for different protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

#### Downsides and Costs
While offering top-notch [[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | security]], [[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | Argent]]'s smart contract nature incurs costs:
*   **Activation Fee**: Activating the wallet requires paying a [[gas_fees_siphoning_in_crypto_scams | gas fee]] (network fee), which can be around $44, depending on network conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Fees**: Upgrading the wallet's features (e.g., ERC-1155 support) also incurs a network fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Wallet Recovery Fee**: Recovering a lost wallet necessitates another network fee payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Previously, [[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | Argent]] covered these costs, but now users are responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Funding Fees**: Funding the wallet by moving funds from Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet) to Layer 2 (ZK Sync) also incurs a network fee, which can be expensive if Ethereum [[gas_fees_siphoning_in_crypto_scams | gas fees]] are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## General Security Advice

For enhanced [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]]:
*   **Consider a Hardware Device**: Using a hardware wallet like Ledger connected to a [[types_of_crypto_wallets | hot wallet]] (e.g., MetaMask) ensures transactions are signed off-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Secure Seed Phrase Storage**: For extreme [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | security]], write down your seed phrase on paper and store it securely offline, ensuring it's not lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## What is IRO?
IRO, or "Introducing Real Estate On Chain," is a process used by the Sidadao platform to bring physical commercial properties onto the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Unlike some decentralized finance (DeFi) projects, Sidadao's offerings are backed by a physical asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The IRO Process
The IRO process aims to connect commercial building owners with participants interested in investing in tokenized real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Property Sourcing and Listing
The platform identifies commercial building owners willing to bring their property on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A detailed page is provided for each property, highlighting its fair value, stable income potential, and current rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Participant Commitment
During an IRO, a minimum sum must be committed by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The commitment period typically lasts 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Participants commit USDC into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Once committed, funds cannot be withdrawn until the IRO process concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Reward Structure
If an IRO is successful, tokens and rewards are distributed to participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These IRO rewards are given directly to participants and supporters instead of paying third-party agents, effectively converting agent fees into participant incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Rewards are allocated based on the proportion of commitment. For example, if a daily reward is $1,000 and a participant commits $1,000 when the total fair value is $100,000 and no one else commits, they receive 100% of the $1,000 reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. If another participant later commits $9,000, the initial participant's share of the reward would reduce to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Outcomes
*   **Successful IRO**: If the minimum required sum is met, committed USDC is swapped for RET (Real Estate Token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These RET tokens can be sold on platforms like UniSwap or used to earn Knight tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Knight is Sidadao's governance token, and holding it provides exposure to other properties listed on the platform, as Sidadao takes 2% of all listed properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful IRO**: If the minimum sum is not met, the committed funds are refunded to participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Case Study: Cardiff Building
The Cardiff Building is the first project announced for an IRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The IRO date for the Cardiff Building is yet to be announced, but more information can be found on Sidadao's Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The IRO value for the Cardiff Building is approximately $21 million, which is the sum that needs to be met, with an associated IRO reward of about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Benefits
The IRO process provides an interesting approach to the [[integration_of_blockchain_and_real_estate | integration of blockchain and real estate]] by ensuring that tokens are backed by a physical asset, adding a layer of tangible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

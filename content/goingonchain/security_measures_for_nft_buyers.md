Users engaging with OpenSea, particularly those involved in buying or listing NFTs, should be aware of recent [[protecting_against_scams | security incidents]] and [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | recommended measures]] to protect their assets.

## Recent Phishing Attack on OpenSea
A [[crypto_scam_awareness | phishing attack]] has been observed on OpenSea, impacting 17 users who inadvertently fell victim to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Trackers indicate that the Ethereum (ETH) stolen by the hacker has been transferred to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Tornado Cash functions as a "washing machine" where crypto is deposited and emerges at an untraceable destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Background of the Incident
The incident originated when OpenSea initiated the release of a new smart contract, requiring users to migrate their listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This contract was designed to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, addressing prior instances where users lost NFTs due to inactive listings being exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. OpenSea disseminated the link to this new contract via their official Twitter channel and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It is suspected that hackers exploited this migration process to target users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Some users have also suggested that the OpenSea contract itself may contain a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Recommended [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | Security Measures]] for Users
To enhance [[security_of_crypto_assets | security of crypto assets]], users are advised to take the following preventative steps:

*   **Revoke OpenSea Approval**: It is recommended to [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | revoke your approval]] granted to OpenSea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   This can be done by visiting Dbank.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
    *   Navigate to the "approval" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
    *   If OpenSea has been granted access, you will see the approval listed there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
    *   Proceed to revoke this access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Revoking a contract requires paying gas fees on the Ethereum network, so be mindful of the current gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

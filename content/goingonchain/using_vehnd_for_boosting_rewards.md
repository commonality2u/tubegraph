On Hundred Finance, users can utilize veHND tokens to boost their rewards. This process involves locking up HND tokens to receive veHND, which then grants the ability to increase the APR on staked assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Obtaining veHND
To obtain veHND, users must lock up their HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This is done on the voting page within Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The amount of veHND received is dependent on the duration for which HND is locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:
*   Locking 100 HND for 4 years yields 100 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Locking 100 HND for 2 years yields 50 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

If additional HND is added to an existing lockup, it will follow the previously committed lockup period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, if a 2-year lockup is active, adding more HND will provide 50% of its value in veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Benefits of veHND
With veHND, users can perform two primary actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>:

1.  **Vote for Pools**: Users can vote to direct more rewards to specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Pools that receive more votes will have a higher average APR on their HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Voting can only be done every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  **Boost Own Rewards**: veHND allows users to boost their own APR on their staked assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. A current APR of 18.87% can be boosted up to 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the required veHND for maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Applying the Boost
To apply the boost, users lock up their HND and then click "apply" on the platform, which triggers a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

After applying the boost, the staking APR can increase significantly, for instance, from 18.87% to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The APR is subject to change in subsequent epochs, based on total votes in different pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The timing of the next epoch's end is displayed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Exploiting Airdrop Mechanics with Flash Loans

The lack of a snapshot requirement for the APE coin airdrop created a unique situation where owning a BAYC (Bored Ape Yacht Club) token allowed for a one-time withdrawal of APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This dynamic caused the floor price of BAYC tokens to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. At one point, a BAYC token was approximately $13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, and holding one could yield about 10,000 APE coin tokens, valued at roughly $130,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### The Flash Loan Technique

An anonymous individual successfully leveraged a [[flash_loan_technique | flash loan]] to capitalize on this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. A [[flash_loan_technique | flash loan]] is a method allowing one to borrow a large sum at low cost, provided it is repaid within the same blockchain block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

The anon discovered a vault on NFTX that contained five unclaimed BAYC tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. These BAYC tokens within the vault were tokenized, conceptually similar to how REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) allow ownership of underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

The process undertaken was as follows:
1.  The anon acquired a BAYC token from OpenSea, costing around $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
2.  This BAYC token was used as collateral on the NFTX vault to secure a [[flash_loan_technique | flash loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
3.  In a single Ethereum transaction, the anon borrowed five BAYC tokens from the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
4.  These borrowed BAYC tokens were immediately used to claim approximately 60,000 APE coin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
5.  The borrowed BAYC tokens were then returned to the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
6.  The originally purchased BAYC token was sold back into the vault, and the claimed APE coin tokens were sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

Through this sequence, the individual reportedly profited by about $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Classification: Attack or Arbitrage?

The nature of this activity is open to interpretation, with questions arising as to whether it constitutes an attack or an [[arbitrage_opportunity_on_terra | arbitrage opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>. Regardless, the individual's ingenuity in executing this complex transaction is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

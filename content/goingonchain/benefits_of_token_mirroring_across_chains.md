Hundred Finance has introduced a significant feature: its first [[Hundred Finance mirroring event | mirroring event]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This development allows users to take their locked veHND (vote-escrowed HND tokens) from one chain, such as Fantom (FTM), and mirror it over to another chain, like Polygon, or any other chain Hundred Finance supports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Understanding Hundred Finance

Hundred Finance is a [[multichain_projects_and_investment | multichain]] lending and borrowing protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It operates on eight different chains, with Polygon being the latest addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. On Hundred Finance, users can:
*   Stake assets to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   Supply assets to use as collateral for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Participate in backstop provision to earn yield from liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Yields are earned in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. These HND tokens can then be locked to become mveHND, which can be used to vote for specific pools, thereby boosting the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, users can achieve a max boost of 2.5x by locking sufficient HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Problem Solved by Mirroring

Before the mirroring feature, a user operating on multiple chains with Hundred Finance would have to perform separate lockups of HND tokens on each chain to gain veHND benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This "double locking" was a significant downside for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## How Mirroring Works and Its Benefits

The mirroring event allows users to easily transfer their locked veHND across chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Once mirrored, this veHND can be used on the target chain to vote and boost the APR on pools there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For instance, veHND mirrored from Fantom to Polygon can be used to boost APR on a USDC pool on Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero service to facilitate this cross-chain mirroring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon, though not all directions are yet fully enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Fantom to Polygon mirroring, for example, functions seamlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Performing a Mirror Operation
The process for mirroring veHND is straightforward:
1.  Navigate to the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Select the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired destination chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
4.  Click "Mirror" and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Overall Impact

This mirroring capability is a significant advantage for Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Without it, users would have less incentive to engage with Hundred Finance on multiple chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Now, with the ability to immediately mirror existing veHND from one chain to another, users have a direct use case to boost their APRs on any supported chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

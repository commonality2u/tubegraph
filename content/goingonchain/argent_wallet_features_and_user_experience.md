The [[argent_smart_wallet_and_security_setup | Argent wallet]] is a type of [[smart_contract_wallets_and_their_features | smart contract wallet]] designed with enhanced security features and a user-friendly interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Unlike traditional wallets, Argent is written on a smart contract, allowing for programmable functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Core Features and Security
Argent's design offers security options not typically found in conventional hot wallets like Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
Key security features include:
*   **Multisig Capability**: Users can set up multi-signature approvals for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Transfer Limits**: It's possible to set limits on transfer amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
*   **Approved Addresses**: Users can pre-approve specific addresses for sending funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Guardians**: Argent allows users to appoint "guardians" who can act as third-party signers, similar to a multisig setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
    *   Guardians can approve transactions, especially for untrusted addresses and dApps, if a transaction exceeds a set limit (e.g., $5,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
    *   Guardians can assist with wallet recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
    *   Guardians can instantly lock a compromised wallet, for instance, if a mobile phone is compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
*   **Token Allowance**: Users can set limits on how much of a specific token can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Open Source Contracts**: Argent's smart contracts are open source, allowing technical users to review them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet Connect Compatibility**: The wallet works with Wallet Connect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## User Experience and Interface
The Argent wallet is noted for its user-friendly interface, particularly when compared to other wallets like Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. The app is considered less complicated and easier to use, possibly due to fewer options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. It is built with users in mind, especially those focused on Layer 2 solutions or Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

### Integrated DeFi and Swapping
Argent integrates DeFi functionalities directly within the wallet, removing the need for users to search for different protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Token Swapping**: Users can trade tokens directly within the wallet, functioning like a decentralized exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Staking**: It supports staking options, such as ETH staking via Lido <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Index Funds**: The wallet features integration with index funds, powered by Index Co-op <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Yield**: Users can participate in stablecoin yield opportunities, earning interest on assets like USDC through protocols like Yearn, Aave, or Zero Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Crypto Purchase**: Users can buy crypto directly within the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Network Compatibility
Currently, the [[argent_smart_wallet_and_security_setup | Argent wallet]] primarily works with Ethereum and ZK-rollups (specifically zkSync) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. It does not support networks like Fantom, Avalanche, or Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Wallet ID
Users receive a unique ID for their wallet, for example, "bossd.argent.xyz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Downsides and Costs
While Argent offers robust security, there are associated costs due to its nature as a [[smart_contract_wallets_and_their_features | smart contract wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
*   **Activation Fee**: Activating the wallet requires paying a gas fee, which can be significant (e.g., ~$44 for 0.0145 ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Fees**: Upgrading wallet functionalities, such as to support ERC-1155 tokens, also incurs a network fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet Recovery Fees**: Recovering a lost wallet address also requires paying a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Previously, Argent covered these costs, but now users must pay them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Funding Fees**: Funding the wallet involves moving funds from Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet) to Layer 2 (zkSync), which incurs network fees depending on Ethereum gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

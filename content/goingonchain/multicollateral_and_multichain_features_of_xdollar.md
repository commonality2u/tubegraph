[[overview_of_xdollar_protocol | xDollar]] is a lending protocol that enables users to borrow stablecoins at a low collateral ratio and zero percent interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A key characteristic of [[overview_of_xdollar_protocol | xDollar]] is its design to be both [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multi-chain]] and multi-collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Aim: Multichain and Multicollateral
[[overview_of_xdollar_protocol | xDollar]] aims to be a [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multi-chain]] and multi-collateral platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means users can utilize various assets like MATIC, Avalanche, or Ethereum as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Supported Chains
[[overview_of_xdollar_protocol | xDollar]] has evolved its chain support across its versions:
*   **[[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | xDollar v1]]**
    *   Works with Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   [[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | xDollar v1]] is currently undergoing a migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **[[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | xDollar v2]]**
    *   Initially launched on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   The team is actively working to onboard [[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | v2]] onto Autochain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, and more layer 2 solutions and protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   The presenter is looking forward to [[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | xDollar v2]] being deployed on other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Benefits
The [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multi-chain]] and multi-collateral approach offers several advantages:
*   **Versatility**
    *   Users can use different assets as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**
    *   Deployment on networks like Polygon will result in cheaper fees for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Low Collateral Ratio**
    *   A significant feature is its low collateral ratio of 110%, which is beneficial for "degen traders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Zero Percent Interest**
    *   Loans carry a zero percent interest rate, though there is a one-time fixed fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This makes it more suitable for long-term borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Use Cases
The [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multi-chain]] and multi-collateral features enable specific use cases:
*   **Borrowing with Diverse Assets**
    *   If [[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | v2]] is available on Polygon, users can use MATIC as collateral to borrow xIM (the stablecoin for [[xdollar_v1_and_v2_differences | v2]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   The borrowed xIM can then be swapped for other stablecoins like USDC to buy other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   This strategy is ideal for long-term borrowing due to the one-time fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

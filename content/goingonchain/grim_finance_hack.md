On a Sunday, Grim Finance experienced a hack, which resulted in a user losing their entire position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The user had placed their position on Saturday night, and the hack occurred the following Sunday morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

Following the hack, a key lesson highlighted was "not your keys, not your coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For those engaging in decentralized finance (DeFi) with large positions, it is recommended to purchase insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Insurance Options

InsurAce is a platform that offers insurance, though it did not cover Grim Finance at the time of the hack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, InsurAce does cover other protocols within the Fantom ecosystem, such as Abracadabra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If a covered protocol is hacked, users can claim their money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

A user also mentioned purchasing Anchor Protocol insurance, noting that it tends to run out quickly, requiring frequent checks for availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Referral codes may be available for discounts on insurance purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

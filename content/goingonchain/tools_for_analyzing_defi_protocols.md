The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has seen a shift in narratives, moving from high-APY "ponzu-like" yield farming, where platform tokens were aggressively sold, to a focus on [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In the [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] model, users of a protocol provide revenue, and holders receive a share of this revenue in mainstream assets like ETH or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This shift necessitates new approaches to [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]].

## Common Valuation Models & Metrics

Common [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]] for DeFi protocols often involve comparing metrics to understand how protocols generate revenues and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This typically includes:
*   **Volume and Fee Generation** Analyzing the trading volume to determine the fees generated by the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio** Calculating a ratio to estimate the P/E, which can then be used to assess if a platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Key Analytical Tools

Several tools are available to help obtain the necessary data for these [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]]:
*   **Token Terminal** A platform that provides various DeFi metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Dune Analytics** Known for its community of "gigachats" who build informative dashboards, offering in-depth [[onchain_analysis_techniques | onchain analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages** Many protocols host their own statistics pages, where users can directly access relevant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Analysis

When utilizing these tools and [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]], several factors must be carefully considered:

> [!NOTE]
> There is no single "right" or "wrong" model; the best approach depends on how one chooses to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

*   **Token Supply Figure** The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can significantly alter results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Emissions as Expenses** Emissions, which are often used to attract users, should be treated as expenses in [[valuation_models_for_defi_protocols | valuation models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Underlying Blockchain and Ecosystem** The choice of blockchain can impact user behavior and platform valuation. For example, if a protocol like dYdX moves to a new chain (e.g., Cosmos), it raises questions about user migration, security, and changes in wallet and interface requirements, all of which can affect its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

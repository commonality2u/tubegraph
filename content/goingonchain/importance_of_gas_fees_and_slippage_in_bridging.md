When [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | bridging]] assets, especially during campaigns like the Arbitrum Odyssey, it's crucial to consider not only the potential rewards, such as [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | airdrops]] and [[bridging_strategies_for_nft_and_airdrop_rewards | NFTs]], but also the practical costs involved: gas fees and slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Gas Fees

Gas fees are the transaction costs on the blockchain. While current gas fees might be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, these costs can accumulate significantly if multiple bridges are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Users have the option to select bridges that offer lower gas fees to minimize costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Slippage

Slippage refers to the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. When bridging, slippage means that the amount of cryptocurrency received on the destination chain might be less than expected based on the initial input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. For example, bridging 0.1 ETH might result in receiving 0.0972 ETH, indicating some slippage occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Some bridges, particularly those that function as [[How to avoid Uniswap fees using aggregators | aggregators]] like Bungee, can help mitigate slippage by pulling information from various sources to find the route with the highest return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, it's important to note that certain bridges might inherently have higher slippage compared to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Key Considerations

When bridging, it's essential to consider both the gas fee and the potential slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. While low gas fees are desirable, a high slippage could result in a greater loss of funds than a higher gas fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Evaluating both factors ensures a more cost-effective and efficient bridging experience.

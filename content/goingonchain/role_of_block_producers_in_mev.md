From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 
The role of block producers, previously known as miners and now validators due to the [[transition_from_proof_of_work_to_proof_of_stake | transition from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake]], is central to [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. MEV is a complex and deep subject, representing both a blessing and a problem, particularly prominent on Ethereum due to its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### What is MEV?
[[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from a block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This extraction is achieved by including, excluding, or changing the order of transactions within a block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The total extracted [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] has reached approximately $675 million, highlighting its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Power of Block Producers
As a block producer (miner or validator), the standard reward is received for block production and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, block producers hold significant power because they can choose which transactions to process and in what order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. They can prioritize transactions that offer more rewards, thereby increasing their own profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Transaction Flow and Validator Selection
Transactions, such as swapping USDC to ETH on Uniswap, making a purchase on OpenSea, or sending tokens to a wallet, enter a public holding area called the mempool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This mempool is transparent, allowing anyone to view pending transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Validators then select transactions from the mempool, validate them, and append them to the blockchain, making them successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Technically, validators have the authority to select pending transactions based on economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Interaction with Searchers
In practice, independent actors known as "searchers" actively monitor the mempool for profitable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These searchers, often using bots, identify opportunities and push them to validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] profits generated by searchers are shared with the block producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Searchers will only bid up to the maximum amount the block producer can earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Value Extraction Strategies
Block producers benefit from various value extraction strategies, often facilitated by searchers:
*   **Gas golfing:** Transactions are structured to use the least amount of gas by having long strings of zeros in addresses or leaving small token balances in contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This allows searchers to increase gas prices to get their transactions processed first while keeping overall gas consumption low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Generalized front-running:** A bot copies a profitable transaction from the mempool, bids up the gas, and gets its own transaction processed first, front-running the original user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Back-running:** Bots rapidly scoop up newly listed tokens at low prices immediately after they are added to a pool, then sell them when prices rise, effectively being the first to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Sandwich trading:** Bots front-run a user's large purchase by buying the token before the user's transaction, and then back-run by selling the token after the user's transaction, causing price impact and high slippage for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Flashbots and Private Pools
Flashbots connect searchers and block producers in a private pool, preventing the general public from being affected by increased gas prices that occur when [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | MEV]] takes place in a public mempool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Searchers bundle opportunities found in the mempool and send them to a Flashbots relay. From there, block builders construct the most profitable blocks, which are then sent to the validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This system allows for centralized block production with decentralized and trustless block validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Common [[use_cases_for_mev_such_as_dex_arbitrage_liquidation_and_sandwich_trading | MEV Use Cases]] for Block Producers
*   [[use_cases_for_mev_such_as_dex_arbitrage_liquidation_and_sandwich_trading | DEX arbitrage]]: Profiting from price differences of the same token across different decentralized exchanges (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   [[use_cases_for_mev_such_as_dex_arbitrage_liquidation_and_sandwich_trading | Liquidations]]: Bots search for lending positions that can be liquidated to earn liquidation fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Freelancers and independent contractors frequently encounter difficulties, often finding themselves at a disadvantage in payment disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Disagreements can arise when a freelancer believes they have met project standards, but the client perceives the work differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Without formal contracts, such situations can devolve into "your word versus my word" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. While platforms like Upwork or Fiverr offer solutions in Web2, the Web3 space presents unique needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Web3 Solutions

For freelancers operating in the Web3 space, platforms like Trust Treaty offer a potential solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Trust Treaty functions as an [[escrow_services_for_freelancers_in_web3 | escrow service]] built on a blockchain, essentially a refundable smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### How Trust Treaty Works

1.  **Contract Creation**: A client, like "Alice," creates a contract on Trust Treaty, detailing the service required, start and end dates, and the agreed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Critical information, including expectations from both parties, must be clearly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  **Payment Lock-in**: The client locks in the payment, which can be in stablecoins like USD, USDT, or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This fund is moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform, to which neither the client nor the service provider has direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  **Platform Fees**: A platform fee is incurred, and a dispute cost is also set (e.g., 50), which decreases if the overall contract value decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
4.  **Anonymity**: Users are represented by wallet addresses, allowing for anonymity. A designer who showcases work on Twitter can remain anonymous while still being part of a client's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
5.  **Contract Execution**: The client signs the contract, generating a unique link that can be shared with the service provider, "Bob" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. After reviewing the details, Bob signs to make the contract effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
6.  **Communication and Payment**: Both parties can communicate via the platform's UI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Once the work is completed, Bob can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If Alice confirms everything is in order, she finalizes the agreement, releasing funds to Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Dispute Resolution

In case of issues, Alice can open a dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Both parties submit evidence, and two independent dispute agents are assigned to analyze the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are disbursed accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   If they disagree, a manager intervenes to make the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Risks Associated with Web3 Freelancing Platforms

While promising, such platforms introduce new risks:

*   **Platform Risk**: If the platform ceases to exist, the locked funds in the secured wallet might also be lost because the keys are not held by either the client or the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dispute Decision Bias**: Although dispute agents are meant to be independent, human bias may still influence their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

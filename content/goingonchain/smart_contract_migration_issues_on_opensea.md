## [[opensea_phishing_attack | Phishing Attack]] Incident

Following a smart contract migration by Opensea, a [[opensea_phishing_attack | phishing attack]] occurred where 17 users accidentally fell victim to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Investigators tracking the hacker's wallet observed that the stolen Ether (ETH) was sent to Tornado Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Tornado Cash functions as a "washing machine" where cryptocurrency can be deposited and then emerge untraceable at a destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The situation is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Background of the Migration

The incident began because Opensea released a new smart contract and requested users to migrate their listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The purpose of this new contract was to upgrade and delete inactive NFTs on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This measure was implemented because people had previously lost NFTs due to inactive listings being exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Opensea announced the link to the new contract on their Twitter channel and also sent out an email about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Attack Vector

It is suspected that the hacker seized the opportunity presented by the smart contract migration to conduct phishing attacks on some users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Additionally, some users have reported that the Opensea contract itself might have a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## User Recommendations

To stay safe during such incidents, users are advised to [[how_to_revoke_opensea_contract | revoke their approval]] to Opensea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This can be done by visiting Dbank, choosing the 'approval' section, and revoking access if Opensea has been granted approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Revoking a contract incurs gas fees, as the action is performed on the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Users should be aware of the prevailing gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Two major Layer 2 (L2) solutions are [[Arbitrum]] and [[Optimism comparison | Optimism]] (OP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Optimism Airdrop

[[Optimism comparison | OP]] airdropped tokens to its early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Arbitrum Airdrop Speculation

It is widely believed that [[Arbitrum]] is also likely to have a token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. To qualify for a potential [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrop]], users may need to complete certain tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Arbitrum Odyssey Program

[[Arbitrum]] initially launched a program called [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This program involved several tasks, such as [[Bridging to Arbitrum | bridging]] assets, and upon completion, users would receive an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It was designed as an eight-week program with weekly tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

However, the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] was halted due to excessive traffic, which caused gas prices to spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This surge in activity was driven by [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | speculation on an airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The solution to handle more traffic was the introduction of [[introduction_to_arbitrum_nitro_upgrade | Nitro]], an upgrade to the chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. [[Nitro upgrade for Arbitrum | Nitro]] went live on August 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Despite the upgrade, the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey program]] did not resume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Current "Quest to Earn Roles" Program

Currently, there is another program that involves completing quests to earn roles on the [[Arbitrum]] Discord <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While this is officially about obtaining Discord roles, there is [[arbitrum_airdrop_speculation | pure speculation]] that these roles might be linked to a future [[Arbitrum airdrop speculation | airdrop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Despite the official stance, approximately 50,000 people have participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The estimated cost for participating in this program is around 0.02 ETH plus gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Completing all tasks grants access to different roles within the [[Arbitrum]] Discord server <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. An attempt was made to create a contract for a "group buy" to complete tasks, but it did not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The program can be accessed at `guild.xyz/Arbitrum` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Participants need to connect their wallet, Discord account, and Twitter handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Various tasks must be completed to gain Discord roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

#### Task Details

Many tasks require purchasing small amounts of tokens, such as 0.01 JMX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These tokens can typically be acquired on Uniswap or SushiSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

For those who wish to complete the [[Arbitrum Odyssey program | Arbitrum Odyssey]] task (even though the program is over), it requires buying an NFT on Xtra Toast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

#### Safety Tip for Token Purchases

When purchasing tokens, it is crucial not to directly paste token names into decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, as this could lead to scam tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The safer method is to view the token on an explorer, copy its contract address, and then paste that address into Uniswap to ensure the correct token is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Once the purchase is made, guild.xyz will refresh, granting access to the Discord role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Completing all tasks can take around 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

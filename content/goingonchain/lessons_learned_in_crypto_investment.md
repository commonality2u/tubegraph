The year 2022 proved to be a challenging period for [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | crypto investment]], with a portfolio described as "down around 18 to 90%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This turbulent year provided significant learnings and key takeaways for investors navigating the volatile market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Crypto Market Overview in 2022

The year was marked by several critical events that impacted the crypto landscape:
*   **Wonderland Rug Pull:** January to February saw the Wonderland rug pull, which significantly affected the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This event drew the speaker into the "frog nation narrative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Hikes:** In March, the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates, from 0.25% to 4.375% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This action caused "money printers stopped" and "risk capital goes away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, leading to a liquidity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Fall of Luna:** May witnessed the major collapse of Luna, described as the "big one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> and the "hardest hit" for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This triggered a "chain reaction" akin to a house of cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Major Platform Collapses:** June saw Celsius halt withdrawals, followed by 3AC and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **FTX Chapter 11:** Later in the year, FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Beyond these major events, 2022 was also characterized by a prevalence of scams and fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Speaker's Personal Response in 2022
Despite the challenging environment, the speaker continued to dollar-cost average (DCA) into "Blue Chip" crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> and joined a Web3 company, building a career within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This provided insights into the "inner workings of crypto" and opportunities to build a network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned

### 1. Understanding the Source of Yield

> [!WARNING] If you do not understand where the yield is coming from, you are the yield. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

Initially, during the bull market, the speaker believed they understood [[understanding_the_sources_of_crypto_yield_and_associated_risks | where the yield was coming from]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, experiences with Wonderland and Terra Luna demonstrated a lack of true understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

To make more informed decisions, the speaker is now focused on acquiring skills like Python and SQL to extract and analyze on-chain data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This allows for a deeper understanding beyond simply following thought leaders, by observing their on-chain actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Tools like Nansen Scan are highlighted as beneficial for informed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This lesson is crucial for [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | cryptocurrency investment strategies]] and [[strategies_for_earning_interest_on_crypto_assets | earning interest on crypto assets]], emphasizing the [[importance_of_doing_your_own_research_in_nft_investments | importance of doing your own research]].

### 2. The Importance of Self-Custody

> [!WARNING] Not your keys, not your coins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

Cases like Celsius and FTX underscored the critical need for self-custody of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. While centralized exchanges (CEX) like Binance and Crypto.com are still used for on-ramping and off-ramping, large sums of assets are not kept on these platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Assets are quickly moved to personal wallets once acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The speaker believes that concerns over trust in CEX platforms will further strengthen the case for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, directly addressing [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | strategies for secure crypto asset management]] and the risks of [[losing_cryptocurrency_in_defi | losing cryptocurrency]]. This also ties into [[considerations_and_risks_in_using_crypto_lending_platforms | considerations and risks in using crypto lending platforms]].

These lessons are integral for developing a robust [[crypto_portfolio_strategy_for_2022 | crypto portfolio strategy]] and navigating future market conditions.

Navigating the volatile cryptocurrency market requires careful strategies, especially when dealing with rapid price fluctuations and capital movements. This article shares personal experiences and lessons learned from participating in high-yield farming projects, highlighting common pitfalls and potential approaches for [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | managing risk]].

## Yield Farming on Guys Farm: A Case Study
The speaker recounts their experience with the Guys Farm, launched on the Phantom network on October 6th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>. This platform quickly amassed 3 billion TVL (Total Value Locked) within a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

### Platform Mechanics and Features
Guys Farm operates similarly to Aave, functioning as a money market where users can lend and borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Lending & Borrowing:** Users supplying assets receive deposit APR for Guys tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Borrowing FTM (Fantom) also yields rewards of 42% APR in Guys tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Decentralized & Non-Custodial:** Guys is a decentralized, non-custodial platform that differentiates itself by having no governance or VCs (Venture Capitalists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. All revenue from the platform is distributed back to token holders and equity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Reward System:** Rewards in Guys tokens are earned by lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity to the Guys-FTM pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Airdrops are also available for supplying on Curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Penalty and Locking:** To prevent immediate dumping of rewards, a 50% penalty is applied if rewards are claimed before 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Users can lock their Guys tokens for three months to earn platform and supernative fees, but this means early exit is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Security & Transparency:** Despite an anonymous team, Guys Farm implements multisig for code changes, requiring three out of five high-profile individuals (from Filecoin Foundation, SpookySwap, DeFi Llama, etc.) to sign off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. A two-day time lock is also in place for changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The team is also transparent in their Telegram group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Personal Experience and Challenges
The speaker initially jumped into Guys Farm due to its extremely high APY (Annual Percentage Yield) of about 10,000% for the liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Investment:** An initial investment of approximately $2,800, split between USDT and FTM, was made into the liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The value of the liquidity pool was about $1,000 at the time of entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   **Early Returns:** When the Guys token price was $10 and daily APR was 1.21%, the speaker earned about 12 tokens a day, generating $120 from a $1,000 investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This high passive income was initially very positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Market Downturn & "Triple Hit":** The painful part came when the Guys token price dropped significantly (from $8 to $1.95) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, and the APY also decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Furthermore, since the liquidity pool was composed of Guys and FTM, the value of the pool dropped as both asset prices declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This combination of falling farming token price, decreasing APY, and declining liquidity pool value resulted in a "triple hit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. The speaker is currently down about 20% on the initial $2,800 investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Lessons Learned
The experience highlighted several critical points for [[key_takeaways_and_lessons_learned_in_crypto_investing | investing in cryptocurrency]] in volatile markets:
*   **Exposure to Multiple Volatile Assets:** Being exposed to two volatile assets in a liquidity pool (Guys and FTM) amplifies losses when both prices decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Capital Flight:** Capital can flee platforms much faster than anticipated in decentralized finance (DeFi). The speaker observed money rapidly moving from the Phantom network to Harmony due to new liquidity mining programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Users need to be constantly monitoring market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   **High APY is Not Always Good:** Jumping into a farm solely because of a high APY can be a mistake, especially when the capital flow is unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Direct Purchase of Farm Tokens:** A common rule in yield farming is not to buy farm tokens directly to put into a liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. The speaker broke this rule by buying Guys tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.
*   **"Degen" (Degenerative) Nature:** High APY pools are often considered "degen" plays, meaning they carry high risk and require caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

> "If you are into your farming and if you are taking the approach where if you are doing a liquidity pool farming, uh, like not using stable coin, then you need to be very careful I need to be on the ball like always be monitoring." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>

## Alternative [[investment_strategies_in_a_volatile_market | Investment Strategies]]
*   **Stablecoin Farming:** Using stablecoins (like USDT, DAI, USDC) for farming can mitigate exposure to asset price volatility as they are pegged to $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. While returns might be slower (e.g., 8% for USDT, 5% for DAI), this approach avoids the "triple hit" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. However, it typically requires a larger capital investment (e.g., five-digit amounts) to generate significant passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.
*   **Borrowing Assets for LP:** Some strategies involve borrowing one asset (e.g., FTM) against another (e.g., Ethereum) to then provide liquidity to a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

## Next Steps and Outlook
Despite the current losses, the speaker plans to continue participating in Guys Farm by vesting earned rewards and locking them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This involves taking rewards every two days, applying the 50% penalty, and then locking them for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. The aim is to earn platform and penalty fees in various tokens (DAI, Guys, Ethereum, FTM, USDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>.

This decision is based on the belief that Guys Network still holds potential, being the second-highest protocol in terms of TVL on the Phantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>. The maximum acceptable loss for this particular [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | portfolio strategy]] is set at $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

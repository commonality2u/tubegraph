[[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]] is presented as a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that facilitates peer-to-peer lending and borrowing, known for its high yield for lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. When introduced to friends, the advertised interest rate of approximately 19.53% often leads to initial skepticism, with claims that it "must be fake or... a scam" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Business Model

The core of [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]]'s operation involves two main parties:

*   **Lenders (e.g., Alice)**: Individuals who deposit money can earn an annual interest rate of 19% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   **Borrowers (e.g., Bob)**: Individuals can borrow money by using their crypto assets as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Borrowers pay a floating interest rate and also receive ANC tokens as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Maintaining High Yield

The platform maintains its high yield for lenders through two primary mechanisms:

1.  **Borrower APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: Borrowers pay a significant interest rate on their loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. For instance, a borrower might pay 21.55% APR on a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **Staking Rewards from Collateral**: When borrowers stake their crypto as collateral, these assets generate staking rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Currently, this staking reward return is approximately 5.83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where Bob wants to borrow $1,000 using $3,000 in [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | bLuna]] as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Alice lends $1,000 and expects a 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Here's how the system covers the yield:

*   **Bob's Payment**: Bob pays 22% on his $1,000 loan, totaling $220 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Collateral Staking Reward**: The $3,000 in [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | bLuna]] collateral, generating a 5% staking reward (in this example), contributes an additional $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Total Collected**: The total amount collected from these two sources is $370 ($220 from Bob's interest + $150 from staking rewards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Distribution**: From the $370 collected, $200 is paid to Alice (the lender), and the remaining $170 goes to the [[Anchor Protocol and bLuna Loans | Anchor Protocol]] yield reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This mechanism demonstrates the "power of decentralized finance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

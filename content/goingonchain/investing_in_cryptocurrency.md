## What are Cryptocurrencies?

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | Cryptocurrencies]] are a form of payment that can be used for trading or exchanging items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Currently, there are top 10 cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Cryptocurrencies Work: The Blockchain

A fundamental concept underlying cryptocurrencies is blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. You can visualize blockchain as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Validators are required to check the database, ensuring that all transactions are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Blockchain Algorithms

Within blockchain, there are two primary algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>:

1.  **Proof of Work (PoW)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
    *   This algorithm requires hardware, such as machines used for "Bitcoin mining," which consume significant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The hardware is used to validate transactions on networks like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  **Proof of Stake (PoS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>
    *   Proof of Stake is increasingly preferred by protocols because it does not necessitate specialized hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. On a Proof of Stake network, control isn't gained through computing power; instead, one would need to own 51% of the cryptocurrency on the network to take it over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens

When discussing cryptocurrencies, the terms "coins" and "tokens" have distinct meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:

*   **Coins** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
    *   These are cryptocurrencies that operate on their own independent blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Examples include Bitcoin, which runs on the Bitcoin network, and Ethereum, which runs on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Tokens** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
    *   Unlike coins, tokens do not have their own standalone blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For instance, USDC and DAI are tokens that operate on top of an existing blockchain, such as the Ethereum chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

This article provides an [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | introduction to cryptocurrency]] concepts, serving as a foundation for understanding [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | cryptocurrency investment strategies]].

## What are Cryptocurrencies?

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | Cryptocurrencies]] are a form of payment that can be used for trading or in exchange for items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Currently, there are top cryptocurrencies available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Cryptocurrencies Work: Blockchain

[[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | Cryptocurrencies]] operate on the concept of a blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The blockchain can be thought of as a public database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

To ensure the validity of transactions, validators are needed to check the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. By validating, they ensure that all transactions are real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Blockchain Algorithms: Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

Within blockchain technology, two popular algorithms are used: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

*   **Proof of Work (PoW)**
    *   This algorithm requires hardware for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   For example, Bitcoin mining involves buying machines and using a lot of energy because they use Proof of Work hardware to validate transactions on the Bitcoin network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

*   **Proof of Stake (PoS)**
    *   Proof of Stake is being chosen by more protocols because it does not require hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, thereby avoiding the issues associated with Proof of Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   On a Proof of Stake network, control cannot be gained just by having a more powerful computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. To take over the network, one would need to own 51% of the cryptocurrency on that network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Coins vs. Tokens

It's important to distinguish between "coins" and "tokens" in the cryptocurrency space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

*   **Coins**
    *   Coins refer to [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrencies]] that have their own blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They run on their own network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   Examples include Bitcoin, which runs on the Bitcoin network, and Ethereum, which runs on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   **Tokens**
    *   Tokens are also [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrencies]], but they do not run on their own blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Examples of tokens include USDC and RVNC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   USDC and DAI, for instance, run on top of the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Understanding these basics of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrency]] is a prerequisite for exploring different ways to [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | invest in cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

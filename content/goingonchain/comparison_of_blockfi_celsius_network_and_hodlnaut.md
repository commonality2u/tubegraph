## What are Crypto Lending Platforms?

Crypto lending platforms can be thought of similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services, such as Funding Societies or MoolahSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Users can participate as either a lender or a borrower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

*   **As a Lender**: You lend out your crypto assets and, in return, receive interest on the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **As a Borrower**: You deposit crypto as collateral to obtain a loan. Once the loan and interest are repaid, your deposited crypto is returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Platform Overviews and Key Features

### BlockFi

BlockFi is one of the more well-known crypto lending platforms and is regulated in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Considerations and Risks

While these platforms offer attractive interest rates compared to traditional banks, it is crucial to consider the inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. If a platform like Celsius Network were to face a significant issue, deposited funds could be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

If you possess cryptocurrencies, you might consider lending them out to earn passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. If you do not hold cryptocurrencies but are interested, stablecoins like USDT or USDC are an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed by the U.S. dollar, essentially similar to holding U.S. dollars but with significantly higher interest rates than traditional bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Crypto lending platforms facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, much like traditional services such as Funding Society or MoolahSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Users can act as lenders, providing funds to earn interest, or as borrowers, depositing crypto as collateral to obtain a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Once a loan's interest is repaid, the deposited crypto is returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

While Hodlnaut offers the highest interest rates for stablecoins, Celsius Network provides an attractive combination of no withdrawal fees, a wider selection of coins, weekly payouts, and decent interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Risk Considerations

It is important to acknowledge the risks involved in crypto lending. If a platform like Celsius Network were to face significant issues, invested funds could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For those holding cryptocurrencies, lending them out can be an option to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Alternatively, if not holding crypto, purchasing stablecoins like USDT or USDC (which are backed by USD) can offer attractive interest rates compared to traditional banking options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

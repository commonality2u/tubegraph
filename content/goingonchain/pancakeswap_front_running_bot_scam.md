A prevalent [[bnb_cryptocurrency_scams | BNB cryptocurrency scam]] involves a deceptive YouTube channel that promises users a bot capable of "front-running" transactions on PancakeSwap to generate profit, specifically targeting BNB cryptocurrency [00:00:03]. The scam claims that by following a script, users can create a bot that will front-run transactions and yield at least 10 BNB [00:00:07, 00:00:09, 00:00:10, 00:00:12].

## How the Scam Operates

The scam typically unfolds in several stages, leveraging psychological manipulation:
1.  **Initial Deception** The scam channel, often appearing legitimate with a high follower count (e.g., 12,000 followers), showcases numerous positive comments that appear "too good to be true" [00:00:15, 00:00:19, 00:00:21, 00:00:57, 00:00:58, 00:00:59].
2.  **Small Investment Test** Victims are encouraged to test the bot with a small amount of BNB [00:00:25, 00:00:26].
3.  **Bot Failure and Excuse** The bot inevitably fails to work. The scammers provide "lame excuses," such as claiming the victim did not invest enough BNB to trigger the front-running mechanism [00:00:27, 00:00:29, 00:00:31, 00:00:33].
4.  **Psychological Trick** The scam then asks for more capital, preying on the victim's desire to recover their initial investment and achieve the promised 10 BNB profit [00:00:33, 00:00:34, 00:00:37, 00:00:41, 00:00:43, 00:00:45, 00:00:46]. This is a common psychological tactic in [[crypto_scam_awareness | cryptocurrency scams]].

## Identifying Red Flags

Several clear indicators can help identify this and similar [[protection_against_scams | scams]]:
*   **Suspicious Channel Metrics** The YouTube channel promoting the scam may have a seemingly high follower count (e.g., 12,000) but only one video, which is highly unusual for a legitimate channel [00:00:15, 00:00:54, 00:00:55, 00:00:56].
*   **Unnaturally Positive Comments** All comments are overwhelmingly positive with no negative feedback, which is unrealistic for any public platform [00:00:19, 00:00:21, 00:00:57, 00:00:58, 00:00:59, 00:01:00].
*   **Malicious Code** The provided script or "code" contains a hidden function that triggers a call to an unknown external wallet, effectively sending the user's funds directly to the scammer. Users are warned against blindly copying and pasting code without understanding where their money is being sent [00:01:00, 00:01:03, 00:01:04, 00:01:05, 00:01:06, 00:01:07, 00:01:08].

Bend Dao is a lending and borrowing platform specifically designed for NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It has recently gained attention in the NFT market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Key Features and Offerings

### Lending and Borrowing NFTs
Users can deposit their NFTs on the platform and borrow Ethereum (ETH) against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Currently, borrowing ETH using an NFT incurs a significant [[interest_rates_on_bend_dao | interest]] of -92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This high [[interest_rates_on_bend_dao | interest]] is attributed to a lack of deposit supply on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Bend Dao only accepts seven selected blue-chip NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Purchasing NFTs at a Discount
The platform allows users to purchase NFTs at a "down payment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For instance, a Mayc NFT with a full price of 14.6 ETH can be acquired for 11.05 ETH, with the remaining amount considered a loan from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Users can repay this borrowed amount at any time, subject to [[interest_rates_on_bend_dao | interest rate]] charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Supplying ETH for High APR
Users can supply ETH to the platform and earn a high Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:06]</a>. As of the transcript, the APR is approximately 72% in ETH earnings plus an additional 10% from the platform token, totaling 77% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The utilization rate for supplied ETH is around 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Bidding on Liquidated NFTs
Bend Dao also offers the ability to bid on liquidated NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. If an NFT owner, for example, borrowed 10.82 ETH against a Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) NFT and its floor price is now 12.32 ETH, the NFT can enter a liquidating state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The owner has 48 hours to redeem the NFT; otherwise, it will go to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Bids must always be greater than the current highest bid plus one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Current State and Challenges
Despite its innovative approach, Bend Dao faces several challenges:
*   **High Utilization Rate**: The high utilization rate means that ETH lenders might encounter difficulties withdrawing their funds when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Bidding Risks**: Bidders for liquidated NFTs must lock up their ETH for 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This risk deters many potential bidders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **NFT Valuation**: Acquiring certain NFTs, like Ape NFTs, through the platform may not always be a favorable deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Bend Dao aims to provide liquidity for NFT holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The NFT lending and borrowing market is continually evolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

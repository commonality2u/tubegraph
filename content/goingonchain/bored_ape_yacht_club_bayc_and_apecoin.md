The Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) is a notable NFT collection. Holders of BAYC NFTs were eligible to receive ApeCoin tokens through an airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## ApeCoin Airdrop Mechanics
ApeCoin, referred to as "the A coin tokens" in the transcript, had an approximate price of $13 at the time of the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Owning a single BAYC NFT entitled the holder to approximately 10,000 ApeCoin tokens, valued at around $130,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

A crucial aspect of this airdrop was the absence of a snapshot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This meant that as long as one possessed a BAYC NFT, they could claim the ApeCoin tokens once, irrespective of when they acquired the NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This mechanism led to an increase in the BAYC floor price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Flash Loan Arbitrage
An individual leveraged a technique known as a flash loan to profit from the ApeCoin airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A flash loan allows for borrowing a large amount of assets at a low cost, provided the loan is repaid within the same blockchain transaction (or block) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### The Process
The anon's process involved the following steps:
1.  **Identify a Vault**: The individual located a vault on NFTX containing five BAYC NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This vault allows the underlying BAYC NFTs to be tokenized, similar to how REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) tokenize real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These specific BAYC NFTs within the vault had not yet claimed their ApeCoin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  **Acquire a BAYC NFT**: The anon bought a BAYC NFT from OpenSea for approximately $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Flash Loan**: This purchased BAYC NFT was used as collateral on the NFTX vault to take out a flash loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
4.  **Borrow and Claim**: In a single Ethereum transaction, the anon borrowed the five BAYC NFTs from the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. These borrowed NFTs were then used to claim approximately 60,000 ApeCoin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
5.  **Return and Sell**: The borrowed BAYC NFTs were immediately returned to the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The initially purchased BAYC NFT was also sold back into the vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Finally, the newly claimed ApeCoin tokens were sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Through this series of rapid transactions, the individual walked away with a profit of approximately $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The nature of this action—whether it constituted an attack or an arbitrage—is a subject of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

*   Provides 6.5% on SGD coin (xSGD), which is significantly higher than any bank in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. xSGD is minted by Strix, formerly known as Xfres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   Offers high rates on other cryptocurrencies, including 8% on Avalanche, 20% on Polygon, and 90% on AXS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Interest is paid daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Does not appear to have tiered interest rates at the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Hodlnaut
*   Interest is paid weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The highest USDT rate recently added is 13.86% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Interest rates are tiered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Platform Access and Interface

### Finblox
*   Currently has no web interface; it is only accessible via its app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   The app interface is described as very similar to Hodlnaut, featuring a savings board and crypto vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Deposits of 100 USDC were made to test the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Hodlnaut
*   (Implied to have a web interface due to contrast with Finblox's app-only access)

## Supported Chains and Fees

### Finblox
*   Integrates with Solana, BNB, and Polygon for deposits, resulting in cheaper transfer fees compared to ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   For Polygon (MATIC) deposits to earn 20%, users can choose the Polygon chain itself for cheaper gas fees instead of ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   However, if minting xSGD to deposit into Finblox, the fees for xSGD minting are still on ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Hodlnaut
*   Mainly uses the ERC20 chain for deposits, which typically incurs higher transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Platform Risk and Regulation

### Finblox
*   Considered a new platform and has platform risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   Upon initial sign-up, there was no KYC (Know Your Customer) process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Hodlnaut
*   Has received in-principle approval from MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore), indicating some level of vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Wonderland is shifting its focus to [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] is the wrapped version of staked TIME (MEMO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It includes the price of TIME and all the rebases, which means it accounts for the interest you earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Switching to [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] is recommended because it enables a wider range of functionalities for your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Advantages of Holding wMEMO

Holding [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] offers several benefits and expanded utility:

### Increased Utility and Yield Generation
[[using_wmemo_on_other_platforms | With wMEMO]], you can engage in various strategies to potentially increase your yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

*   **Borrowing Stablecoins**: You can use [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] on platforms like Abracadabra to borrow the MIM stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Providing Liquidity**: [[using_wmemo_on_other_platforms | wMEMO]] can be used as a liquidity provider (LP) on decentralized exchanges like SushiSwap, pairing it with MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Structured Products with Pendle**: For those interested in structured products, [[using_wmemo_on_other_platforms | wMEMO]] can be broken apart using the Pendle service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This allows for specialized yield management:
    *   **OT (Original Token) wMEMO** represents the time value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   **YT (Yield Token) wMEMO** represents the yield value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
    *   If you anticipate a drop in Wonderland's interest rates, you can sell your YT [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] and buy OT [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] to lock in your yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Value Accrual
When you convert MEMO to [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]], the *quantity* of your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, the *quantity* of MEMO you can unwrap from your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This is because [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] inherently includes the price and the rebases (interest earned) of the underlying MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Simplified Tracking
You do not need to constantly wrap and unwrap your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] to check its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A service called "the bank" allows you to easily [[tracking_the_value_of_wmemo_and_eligibility_for_airdrops | track the value]] of your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Airdrop Eligibility
Holding [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] makes you eligible for Wonderland airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This applies whether your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] is held on the Avalanche, Ethereum, or Fantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## How to Convert to wMEMO
If you are already staking on Wonderland, you can find a "Wrap" function on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Clicking this allows you to [[how_to_convert_time_and_memo_to_wmemo | wrap your MEMO into wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To convert back, you can click the arrow icon to change [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] back to MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

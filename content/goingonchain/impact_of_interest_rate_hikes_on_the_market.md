The Federal Reserve's actions regarding interest rates have a notable impact on the market, influencing equity levels and overall market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Federal Reserve Policy

The primary objective of the Federal Reserve is to reduce inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. To achieve this, they are prepared to continue raising interest rates if inflation persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The tightening of the Federal Reserve's policy leads to less equity available in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Market Reaction

Since the interest rate hikes began, the market has demonstrated a trend of selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Additionally, the presence of an [[inverted_yield_curve_and_recession_signals | inverted yield curve]] typically signals a potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The market has a tendency to behave irrationally for extended periods, potentially longer than an individual can remain financially solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This suggests that further selling in the market could be imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

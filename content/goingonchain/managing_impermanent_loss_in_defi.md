When engaging in [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | farming opportunities]] on different blockchain networks, such as Avalanche (AVAX), participants often seek high yields. For instance, an AVAX/UST pool might offer up to 56% in yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, one significant [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | risk]] associated with providing liquidity in such pools is [[risks_of_investing_in_volatile_liquidity_pools | impermanent loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

To mitigate the concern of [[risks_of_investing_in_volatile_liquidity_pools | impermanent loss]], investors have the option to park their assets in stablecoin pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While the yield may be lower compared to volatile asset pairs, stablecoin pools offer a more predictable return, with a stablecoin pool on AVAX potentially earning around 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

For example, after bridging UST to AVAX, users can deposit their UST into a stablecoin pool on platforms like Pangolin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This strategy allows investors to participate in [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | yield farming]] while reducing their exposure to [[risks_of_investing_in_volatile_liquidity_pools | impermanent loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

In a volatile market with rising interest rates, it is important to find ways to make crypto assets work harder, potentially to offset expenses like mortgage interest [00:00:11]. The current environment has seen many centralized finance (CeFi) platforms exposed to issues like Terra or 3AC, leading to withdrawal freezes or bankruptcies [00:00:25]. While withdrawing assets from such services (e.g., Hodlnaut, Finblox) enhances security, it means those assets are not earning yield [00:00:36].

Several strategies exist for earning interest on crypto assets:

## Parking Assets in Centralized Exchanges (CeFi)

Many cryptocurrency exchanges offer services to earn interest on parked assets. This often involves [[using_crypto_exchanges_for_asset_lending_and_earning_interest | lending out crypto assets]] to the platform or other users.

*   **KuCoin:** On KuCoin, users can lend out their crypto assets for interest with specified terms, such as 7 or 14 days [00:00:59]. Additionally, "KuCoin Earn" allows parking [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoins]] or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR), with tenure options being flexible or fixed [00:01:10]. Such services are generally available on most crypto exchanges [00:01:23].
*   **FTX (prior to its collapse):** The FTX app (distinct from FTX Pro) offered a simpler interface for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing assets [00:02:17]. Transferring ERC-20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX app was free [00:02:32].
    *   **Interest Rates:** For USDC, the initial $10,000 earned 8% APR, dropping to 5% for amounts exceeding this limit, resulting in a blended rate like 6.1% [00:02:57]. Other assets like Ethereum also shared this interest rate [00:03:16].
    *   **Withdrawals:** Users could withdraw up to $2,000 without KYC verification [00:03:25]. Withdrawals could be made via international wire transfer to a foreign currency bank account or as USDC to a MetaMask or other crypto wallet, with no withdrawal fees [00:03:31].
    *   **Yield Source (FTX):** The yield generated by FTX was speculated to come from:
        *   Lending assets to the FTX platform for margin and lending activities [00:04:32].
        *   Acting as a source of liquidity for lending and borrowing on FTX Pro [00:04:41].
        *   Marketing budgets, as a way to attract users to the FTX app [00:04:53].

> [!CAUTION] Risk Warning
> Earning interest through centralized exchanges is not risk-free [00:03:59]. There is inherent platform risk; if the platform experiences issues or goes bankrupt, assets held on the exchange could be lost [00:04:03].

## Parking Assets in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

DeFi platforms offer alternatives for earning yield, often through staking or liquidity provision.

*   **Liquid Staking:** Platforms like Lido or Rocket Pool allow users to stake Ethereum (ETH) to earn rewards, typically around 4% [00:01:30]. Running one's own node for staking can yield higher ETH rewards [00:01:40].

## Secure Asset Management (Non-Yield Bearing)

While not directly an interest-earning strategy, holding assets securely is a fundamental aspect of [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | crypto portfolio strategy]].

*   **Self-Custody:** Storing crypto assets in a personal wallet is considered the safest method, adhering to the principle of "your keys, your coin" [00:01:47]. This allows users to wait for price appreciation without relying on third-party platforms [00:01:51].

## Risk Management

To manage risk effectively, especially after learning from past market events, it is prudent to diversify assets across different strategies, ensuring some assets continue to earn yield [00:02:02].

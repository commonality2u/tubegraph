[[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] is a decentralized Automated Market Maker (AMM) on Terra, designed to facilitate token exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It aims to address limitations found in existing AMMs on Terra, such as [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Addressing Existing AMM Limitations

Traditional AMMs, like [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Uniswap]], primarily use a single "constant product" pool type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While effective for high-volatility pairs such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, this model is not suitable for stablecoin pools or newly launched tokens, often resulting in significant slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Additionally, providing liquidity on platforms like [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] can lead to users missing out on benefits from native protocols; for instance, providing ANC-UST liquidity on [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]] means losing Anchor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Key Features and Advantages

[[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] is designed to overcome these challenges through several key features:

### [[improvements_in_user_interface_and_experience | Improved User Interface and Experience]] (UI/UX)
[[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] provides a significantly [[improvements_in_user_interface_and_experience | better UI/UX]] compared to a basic swap screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It offers chart trends and a more user-friendly interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This contrasts with [[comparisons_between_astroport_and_other_amms_like_terraswap_and_uniswap | Terraswap]], which has a very basic interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. More advanced AMMs like SpiritSwap demonstrate that such platforms can offer features like charts and APY displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Multiple Pool Types
Instead of a single constant product pool, [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] offers three distinct types of pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The primary goal of these varied pools is to provide users with optimal exchange rates and reduced slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Astro Generators (Double Farming)
Astro Generators are described as the most powerful feature of [[overview_and_introduction_of_astroport_as_a_next_generation_amm_on_terra | Astroport]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This feature addresses the issue of losing native protocol benefits when providing liquidity on an AMM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For example, if a user provides ANC-UST liquidity to an Astro Generator, it acts as a proxy smart contract that ties the user to ANC, allowing them to earn Anchor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This concept, known as "double farming," enables users to earn the extra token provided to the pool and also the native token (e.g., ANC) from the underlying protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

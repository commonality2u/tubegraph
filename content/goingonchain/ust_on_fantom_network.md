UST is now available on the Fantom Network (FTM), which is considered positive news for the crypto ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Increased demand for UST is expected to lead to a better price for LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Bridging UST to [[phantom_network_and_its_decentralized_nature | Fantom Network]]

When swapping or bridging UST to the [[phantom_network_and_its_decentralized_nature | Fantom Network]], specific steps must be followed:
*   Use the bridge, not the router <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Set the bridging option to "non-EVM" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
*   Search for UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   Connect your Terra wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   Connect your MetaMask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   Once connected, the bridging process can be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. An example given includes bridging 5 UST over the [[phantom_network_and_its_decentralized_nature | Fantom Network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

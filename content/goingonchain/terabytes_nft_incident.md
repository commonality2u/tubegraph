1.  **Poor Artwork Quality** Some speculated that the public's backlash was due to the perceived low quality of the artist's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
2.  **Generated Art** Another story suggested that the artwork was not original, but rather generated using a "pixel dupe maker" which can create pixel drawings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

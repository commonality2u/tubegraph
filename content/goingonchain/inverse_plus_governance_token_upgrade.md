Inverse Finance recently upgraded its governance token, now called Inverse Plus, with the aim of adding more value to the token beyond just voting [00:00:05]. This new iteration is designed as a "positive sum rewards token" [00:00:25].

## Inverse Finance Ecosystem
Inverse Finance's ecosystem consists of three main products:
*   **IMV Token**: The governance token that can be bought and staked [00:00:30].
*   **Anchor**: A platform for lending and borrowing assets [00:00:33].
*   **DOLLAR**: Inverse Finance's native stablecoin [00:00:35].

### DOLLAR Stablecoin
The DOLLAR stablecoin offers farming opportunities on both Ethereum (ETH) and Fantom networks [00:00:42]. For swapping DOLLAR, users can utilize Curve or Stabilizer [00:00:48]. Stabilizer is Inverse Finance's proprietary liquidity pool, pairing DAI and DOLLAR with a swap fee of 0.4% and guaranteeing a fixed rate of 0.996 [00:00:51]. The Stabilizer pool has approximately $4 million in liquidity [00:01:03].

### Anchor: Lending and Borrowing
Anchor is the lending and borrowing platform within Inverse Finance, boasting a total value locked (TVL) of around $65 million [00:01:07]. Users can deposit assets to earn base rewards and rewards APR [00:01:15]. For instance, depositing ETH yields a base reward of 0.08% APY and an additional 5.34% APR in IMV tokens [00:01:22].

The IMV token stands out with an APY of 122% when supplied, as supplying IMV also simultaneously stakes it [00:01:32]. The Inverse Finance team aims to enhance the value of their governance token through the benefits offered to IMV stakers [00:01:42].

When IMV is deposited into Inverse Finance, users receive xIMV in return, which provides several advantages:

1.  **IMV Emission**: xIMV holders receive IMV emissions, distributed per ETH block, which occurs approximately 6,400 times daily [00:01:58]. The staking cap for IMV to earn xIMV is set at 500% APY, a cap that can only be altered through a new governance vote [00:02:11]. There is no maximum supply for the IMV token, but the DAO can introduce a cap to cease minting if emissions become too high [00:02:18].
2.  **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest [00:02:27].
3.  **[[voting_dynamics_in_defi_protocols | Voting Rights]]**: xIMV holders gain voting rights on the Inverse Finance governance page [00:02:40]. The governance platform is active, with 35 proposals completed and 32 having passed, including the recent Inverse Plus upgrade, all through on-chain voting [00:02:44].
4.  **Collateral for DOLLAR Borrowing**: xIMV can be used as collateral to borrow DOLLAR [00:02:56]. This allows users to buy and supply IMV, earn IMV emissions (e.g., at 122% APY), receive a cut of protocol revenue, participate in governance, and simultaneously use their staked IMV as collateral to borrow stablecoins [00:03:01]. This offers significant capital efficiency, as the staked IMV continues to earn its APY even while being used as collateral, and funds are not locked [00:03:15]. For example, staking $100 worth of IMV and borrowing $30 of DOLLAR means the original $100 IMV still earns 122% APY [00:03:19].

## Transparency
Inverse Finance features a transparency tab that provides links to smart contracts and details on how they interact with each other, alongside financial numbers similar to a company's balance sheet [00:03:36].

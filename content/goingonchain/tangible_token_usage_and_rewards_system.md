The Tangible marketplace operates with its own native token, which is central to its fee distribution, stablecoin backing, and reward mechanisms.

## Platform Fee Distribution

When an item is acquired from another seller on the Tangible platform, a 2.5% platform fee is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This fee is then allocated as follows:
*   **33%** is used to buy and burn Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **66.66%** goes to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Role in USDR Stablecoin

Tangible tokens are part of the collateral mix for USDR, an over-collateralized stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. USDR is backed by a blend of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, Dai, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. To prevent a "death spiral" similar to the UST incident, Tangible ensures that at least 88% of the backing assets are non-native, meaning their native token can only be used to mint USDR when other assets make up the majority of the collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Token Utilities

Beyond fee distribution and stablecoin collateral, Tangible tokens are used for:
*   Minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Collecting revenue from product sales on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Staking and Rewards (v-concept)

Tangible tokens incorporate a "v-concept" for their reward system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Users can stake and lock their Tangible tokens to convert them into an [[nft_and_tokenization | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   The duration of the lock determines the reward, with longer locking periods yielding higher rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Should a user wish to exit their position, they have the option to sell their [[nft_and_tokenization | NFT]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

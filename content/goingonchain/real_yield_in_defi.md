Real Yield is a new narrative within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It represents a different approach to generating rewards compared to traditional yield farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## How Real Yield Differs from Traditional [[yield_farming_vs_real_yield | Yield Farming]]

Traditional [[yield_farming_vs_real_yield | yield farming]] often involved highly inflationary platform tokens, where users would buy and lock tokens to earn more of the same token, often leading to a quick sell-off of rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These setups could result in very high annual percentage yields (APYs), sometimes over 10,000%, but were often described as "Ponzi-like" due to their reliance on new capital to sustain rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

In contrast, Real Yield protocols provide rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. When users interact with the protocol, holders of the protocol's token receive a portion of the revenue generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These rewards are distributed in "mainstream assets" such as Ether (ETH) or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## [[examples_of_real_yield_protocols | Examples of Real Yield Protocols]]

*   **GMX:** Users who stake GMX tokens earn GMX tokens and also receive ETH rewards generated from network activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **GNS:** Staking GNS can yield a 4% return in Dai (DAI) stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Umami:** By depositing tokens into Umami, users can earn ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Kujira:** Kujira, now its own blockchain, allows stakers to collect rewards in various asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Valuation Models for Real Yield Protocols

Common valuation models for Real Yield protocols often involve comparing various metrics to understand how protocols are generating revenue and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

A typical approach involves:
1.  Analyzing the protocol's volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  Determining the amount of fees generated from that volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  Calculating a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
4.  Using the P/E ratio to assess if the platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Tools for Data Collection

Several tools can assist in gathering the necessary data for these valuations:
*   **Token Terminal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   **Dune Analytics:** Features informative dashboards built by contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages:** Many protocols host their own pages displaying relevant statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

### Key Considerations for Valuation

When performing valuations, several factors should be noted:
*   **Supply Figures:** The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can significantly impact the valuation results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses:** Token emissions, which are used to attract users, can be treated as expenses in the valuation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Chain Migration:** Consider the impact of a protocol moving to a new blockchain, such as dYdX migrating to Cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Factors like changes in underlying security (e.g., moving away from Ethereum's security) and the requirement for users to adopt new wallets and interfaces can affect user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

There is no single "right or wrong" valuation model; the best approach depends on how one chooses to construct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

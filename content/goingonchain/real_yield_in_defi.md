Real Yield represents a new narrative within the decentralized finance (DeFi) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It addresses some of the challenges and inflationary models seen in earlier [[differences_between_real_yield_and_traditional_yield_farming|yield farming]] practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Defining Real Yield

Unlike the "ponzi" models of the past where [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto|yield farming]] often involved buying and staking platform tokens to earn more of the same, highly inflationary tokens, Real Yield offers rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

With Real Yield, when users engage with a protocol, holders of the protocol's token receive a share of the revenue generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These rewards are typically provided in mainstream assets like Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins, rather than the protocol's native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Protocols Utilizing Real Yield

Several protocols exemplify the Real Yield model:
*   **GMX**: Staking GMX earns users both GMX tokens and ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **GNS**: Staking GNS allows users to earn 4% in DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Umami**: Depositing assets into Umami yields ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Kujira**: Now operating as its own blockchain, Kujira allows users to collect rewards in various assets when staking its native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Valuation Models for Real Yield Protocols

Common valuation models for Real Yield protocols often compare metrics to assess how protocols are performing in terms of revenues and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Process
Typically, these models involve:
1.  **Volume Analysis**: Assessing the trading volume or activity within the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  **Fee Generation**: Calculating the fees generated from that volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  **Ratio Calculation**: Running ratios to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
4.  **Undervaluation Assessment**: Using the P/E ratio to determine if the platform might be undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Tools for Data
Several tools can assist in obtaining the necessary data for these valuations:
*   **Token Terminal**: A platform providing crypto project data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Dune**: Features informative dashboards built by data analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages**: Many protocols host their own dedicated statistics pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Valuation
When performing valuations, several factors should be taken into account:
*   **Supply Figure**: The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can significantly alter valuation results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Token emissions, which are used to attract users, can be treated as an expense in the valuation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Chain and Migration**: Consider the underlying blockchain and potential user migration risks. For example, if a protocol like DYDX moves to a new chain (e.g., Cosmos), it's important to assess how likely users are to follow, given changes in security models (from Ethereum) and the need for different wallets and interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

There is no single "right" or "wrong" valuation model; the approach depends on how one chooses to build it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

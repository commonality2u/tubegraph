*   ZKsync (Layer 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:070">[03:42:070]</a>
It does not currently support networks like Avalanche, Polygon, or Fantom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:900">[03:44:900]</a>.

## Integrated DeFi and Investment Options
Argent aims to bring DeFi functionalities directly to the user within the wallet:
*   **In-Wallet Swaps (DEX)** Users can trade tokens directly within the wallet, similar to a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:020">[06:40:020]</a>.
*   **Staking** Users can stake tokens, for example, by utilizing Lido for ETH2 staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:980">[06:48:980]</a>.
*   **Index Funds** The wallet integrates with Index Code to offer investment in index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:110">[07:16:110]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Yields** Users can participate in stablecoin yield farming, choosing protocols like Yearn, Aave, or Zero Protocol for leveraged yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:440">[07:23:440]</a>.

## [[cost_associated_with_using_argent_wallet | Cost Implications]]
Due to its nature as a smart contract wallet, there are several [[cost_associated_with_using_argent_wallet | costs associated with using Argent]]:
*   **Wallet Activation Fee** A network fee (gas fee) must be paid to activate the wallet, which essentially involves deploying a smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:180">[03:02:180]</a>. This fee can be around $44 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:030">[04:42:030]</a>.
*   **Upgrade Fees** Upgrades, such as for RERC 1155 tokens, also incur network fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:230">[08:00:230]</a>.
*   **Wallet Recovery Fee** If a user needs to recover their wallet, another network fee is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:150">[08:11:150]</a>.
*   **Funding Fees** Funding the wallet incurs network fees as it involves moving funds from Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet) to Layer 2 (ZKsync) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:070">[08:26:070]</a>. These fees depend on the Ethereum gas price, potentially making funding expensive when gas is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:120">[08:57:120]</a>.

In the past, Argent covered these costs, but users are now responsible for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:030">[08:18:030]</a>.

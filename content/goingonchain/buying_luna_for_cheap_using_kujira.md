Kujira offers a project designed to allow users to [[premium_bids_and_discounts_for_bluna | buy LUNA for cheap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This project, known as Orca, provides retail users access to liquidated bLUNA, a process previously dominated by whales and bots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Understanding Liquidation in Anchor Protocol

Users can [[using_terra_luna_to_earn_more_luna | take out loans via Anchor Protocol]] by depositing bLUNA as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The recommended Loan-to-Value (LTV) for these loans is 45%, and liquidation occurs if the LTV reaches 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### Example of Liquidation
Suppose 2 bLUNA is deposited, with bLUNA valued at $50, making the collateral worth $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This allows for a loan of $45 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. If the price of bLUNA drops to $30, the 2 bLUNA collateral would be worth $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. At this point, the LTV would be 75%, exceeding the 60% liquidation threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The borrower keeps the $45 loan but loses their bLUNA collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Historically, this liquidated LUNA would go to whales or bots who participate in liquidation auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These participants could acquire liquidated bLUNA at a significant discount, sometimes receiving a 16.6% "premium" or discount based on the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Kujira Orca: A Solution for Retail Users

Kujira's Orca protocol allows retail users to participate in the bidding for liquidated bLUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### How Kujira Orca Bidding Works
The [[how_kujira_auction_system_works | auction system]] on Kujira Orca operates by allowing users to place bids with a specified "premium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Premium Definition**: A higher premium means the bidder is willing to pay less for the bLUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Bidding Process**: Users deposit a UST amount as a bid, specifying their desired premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Bid Prioritization**: The system triggers bids with the lowest premium first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Zero Premium**: Placing a premium of 0 is equivalent to buying bLUNA at the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Most bids on the platform are observed to be within a 4% to 6% premium range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. When a bid is successful, the user acquires the discounted bLUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Fees and Kujira (KUJI) Tokens
Kujira generates revenue from two sources:
1.  UST from smart contract execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  A 1% withdrawal fee when users withdraw their discounted bLUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Kujira also has its own token, KUJI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Users can pay transaction fees using KUJI tokens and receive a discount ranging from 50% to 90% of the UST value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Team and Future Outlook
The Kujira team is supported by strong investors and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. They conducted their Initial DEX Offering (IDO) on November 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. While the concept may not seem particularly exciting in a bull market, it could offer significant opportunities to acquire good deals during a market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

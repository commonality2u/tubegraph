## Tracking the Value of wMEMO

There is no need to repeatedly wrap and unwrap your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] to check its current value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. A dedicated service called "The Bank" allows users to easily view the value of their [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

It's important to note that while the quantity of your [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] does not change, the amount of MEMO you can unwrap from it increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This is because [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] includes the price of TIME and all rebases, representing the interest earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. For example, if you return five days later with the same amount of [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]], you will find that the quantity of MEMO available for unwrapping has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Eligibility for Airdrops

Holding [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] makes you eligible for Wonderland airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This applies if you are holding [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] on various networks, including Avalanche, Ethereum, and Phantom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This eligibility for [[airdrop_opportunities_during_the_campaign | airdrop opportunities]] is a benefit of holding [[what_is_wmemo | wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

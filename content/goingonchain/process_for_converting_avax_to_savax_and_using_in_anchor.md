## Getting sAVAX
sAVAX (also referred to as "stick avex") is a form of [[introduction_of_new_collateral_like_avex | collateral]] that can be used within Anchor Protocol on the [[ust_availability_and_usage_on_avax | AVAX chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. To obtain sAVAX, users can get it from Benqi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Navigating to Benqi's liquid staking section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
2.  Staking your AVAX, which converts it into sAVAX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
    *   sAVAX is a yield-bearing token, currently earning approximately 7.2% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Using sAVAX on Anchor (AVAX Chain)
Once you have the sAVAX token, you can bring it back to Anchor to provide it as [[collateral_and_staking_rewards_in_anchor | collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This functionality is available when [[connecting_metamask_for_anchor | connected]] to the [[ust_availability_and_usage_on_avax | AVAX chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

Users can then [[borrowing_ust_using_savax_on_the_avax_chain | borrow UST]] against their sAVAX collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. When increasing a borrow, the recommended LTV (Loan-to-Value) ratio is 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Using Anchor directly on the [[ust_availability_and_usage_on_avax | AVAX chain]] for depositing and borrowing is considered the most convenient way to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## sAVAX on Terra Chain
While it is possible to see "wstAVAX" (wrapped sAVAX) on the Terra chain within Anchor, using it there requires additional steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. To use sAVAX on the Terra chain, it would need to be crossed over via the [[using_wormhole_ust_for_anchor | Wormhole]] bridge, where it would convert into wstAVAX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This process is currently considered troublesome and unnecessary for most users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

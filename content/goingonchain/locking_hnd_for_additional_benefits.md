Hundred Finance allows users to [[earning_yield_on_locked_vehnd_tokens | lock their HND tokens]] to gain additional benefits and influence within the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This process converts HND into veHND (Vote Escrowed HND), which grants voting power and the ability to boost rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Earning HND Rewards

Before locking HND, users must first earn it. This is done by supplying assets (e.g., MIM) and then staking the received h-token receipt (e.g., hMIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Supply APY**: When you supply a stable or crypto asset, you earn a supply APY (e.g., 0.27% for MIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Staking APR**: To earn HND token rewards (e.g., 18.89% APR), you must stake your h-token receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Once you stake your h-token, you will no longer be able to take a loan against your supplied assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If your objective is to take a loan, you should only supply and borrow, not stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

HND rewards can be collected from the HND section of the dashboard by clicking "collect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Converting HND to veHND

To convert HND into veHND, navigate to the "vote" page on Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The amount of veHND you receive depends on the quantity of HND locked and the duration of the lockup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:
*   Locking 100 HND for 4 years yields 100 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   Locking 100 HND for 2 years yields 50 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   If you add more HND to an existing lockup, the new amount will follow the previously committed lockup period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Benefits of veHND

With veHND, you can engage in two primary activities to [[using_mvehnd_for_voting_and_boosting_apr | enhance your benefits]]:

### 1. Voting for Pools
You can use your veHND to vote for specific liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Pools that receive more votes will have a higher average APR on their HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Voting can be done every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The impact of votes on APR updates each epoch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, and the ending time of the current epoch is displayed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### 2. Boosting Your Own Rewards
[[using_vehnd_for_boosting_rewards | veHND allows you to boost your own HND staking rewards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For example, an APR of 18.87% (at 1x boost) can be increased up to 2.5x with sufficient veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine how much veHND is needed to achieve the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   After locking HND, you can apply the boost by clicking the "apply" button on the interface, which triggers a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   The applied boost will increase your staking APR (e.g., from 18.87% to 45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. However, the APR may change in subsequent epochs depending on collective voting patterns (e.g., dropping to 33% if another pool like USDC gains more votes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

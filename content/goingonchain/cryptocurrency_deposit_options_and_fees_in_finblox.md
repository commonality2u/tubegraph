Finblox offers various cryptocurrency deposit options, providing competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) and leveraging multiple blockchain networks to reduce transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Supported Cryptocurrencies and APY

Finblox supports deposits for several cryptocurrencies, offering different APY rates:
*   **USDC** and **USDT**: Currently offer 15% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **SGD Coin (xSGD)**: An SG-dollar stablecoin (by Strix, formerly Xfers) gives 6.5% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Users can mint xSGD from SGD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Avalanche (AVAX)**: Offers 8% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Polygon (MATIC)**: Provides 20% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Axie Infinity Shards (AXS)**: Yields a high 90% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Interest payouts on Finblox are daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Supported Deposit Chains and Fee Implications

A key advantage of Finblox is its integration with multiple blockchain networks for deposits, which helps reduce transfer fees:
*   **Solana** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **BNB (Binance Smart Chain)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **Polygon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>

These integrations mean that transfer fees are generally "way cheaper" compared to platforms primarily using ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, depositing MATIC can be done directly on the Polygon network, leading to cheaper gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

However, it's important to note that while depositing xSGD into Finblox, the minting process for xSGD itself is still on the ERC20 chain, incurring those associated fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_finblox_and_hodlnaut | Comparison with Hodlnaut]]

*   **Interest Payouts**: Finblox pays interest daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, whereas Hodlnaut pays weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Deposit Chains**: Hodlnaut primarily uses the ERC20 chain for deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. In contrast, Finblox integrates with Solana, BNB, and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, which generally results in lower transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Interest Tiers**: Hodlnaut employs tiered interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, while Finblox does not appear to have tiers at the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin APY**: Finblox offers 15% APY on USDC and USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Hodlnaut's highest stablecoin rate, for USDT, was recently 13.86% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Currently, Finblox is only accessible via its mobile application, with no web interface available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

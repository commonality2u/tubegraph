[[Introduction to xDollar protocol | xDollar]] is a lending protocol designed to enable borrowing of stablecoins at a low collateral ratio and zero percent interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A core aim of [[Introduction to xDollar protocol | xDollar]] is to be [[Multichain projects and investment | multi-chain]] and [[Multichain projects and investment | multi-collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Current Multi-chain Presence

[[Features of xDollar V1 and V2 | xDollar V1]] operates across Avalanche, Polygon, and Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. [[Features of xDollar V1 and V2 | xDollar V1]] is currently undergoing a migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

[[Features of xDollar V1 and V2 | xDollar V2]] has been launched on the Ethereum network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. As of the current information, [[Features of xDollar V1 and V2 | xDollar V2]] is only on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Future Expansions

The team behind [[Introduction to xDollar protocol | xDollar]] is working to deploy [[Features of xDollar V1 and V2 | V2]] onto other chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The protocol aims to be cross-chained, moving beyond just Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Future plans include onboarding more Layer 2 solutions and Layer 1 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For instance, there are plans for [[Features of xDollar V2 | xDollar V2]] to connect with Polygon, allowing users to borrow stablecoins using MATIC as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Benefits of Cross-chain Capabilities

The [[Multichain projects and investment | multi-collateral]] feature of [[Introduction to xDollar protocol | xDollar]] allows users to utilize different assets to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Operating on chains like Polygon would offer users the benefit of cheap transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This [[Multichain projects and investment | cross-chain]] approach enhances the protocol's accessibility and utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Locking HND for veHND Rewards on Hundred Finance

On [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | Hundred Finance]], users can earn [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | HND]] tokens by supplying and staking crypto assets like MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. These earned [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | HND]] tokens can then be locked up to gain further rewards and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### Obtaining veHND
To acquire [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]], users must lock up their [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | HND]] token balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This process converts [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | HND]] into [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] based on the duration of the lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>:
*   Locking 100 [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | HND]] for 4 years yields 100 [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   Locking 100 [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | HND]] for 2 years yields 50 [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
If additional [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | HND]] is added to an existing lock-up, it will follow the previously committed period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Utilities of veHND
[[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] primarily offers two key functionalities:

1.  **Voting for Pool Rewards**: Users can [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | vote]] to direct more rewards to specific liquidity pools. Pools with more [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | votes]] receive a higher average APR on [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | HND]] rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Boosting Personal Rewards**: [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] allows users to [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | boost]] their own staking APR (Annual Percentage Rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. For example, a staking APR of 18.87% could be [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boosted]] up to 2.5 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the amount of [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] needed for maximum boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Boosting APR
To activate the [[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | boost]], users must apply the locked [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This triggers a transaction that adjusts the APR immediately, as seen with an APR increasing from 18.87% to 45% after a 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Epochs and Voting Cycles
[[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | Voting]] and [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | boosting]] adjustments can only be made every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The distribution of rewards and the average APR of pools are influenced by the total [[boosting_rewards_with_vehnd_voting | votes]] received in each "epoch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The ending time for the current epoch is displayed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

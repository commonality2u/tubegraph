The [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Ethereum Merge]] marks the network's complete transition from a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof of Stake (PoS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This transition is a significant upgrade for the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Ethereum]] blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## What is The Merge?
The current [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Ethereum]] mainnet combined with the Beacon Chain constitutes the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The Beacon Chain, which serves as [[ethereums_transition_from_pow_to_pos | Ethereum's Proof of Stake]] chain, has been operational since December 1st, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Platforms like Binance, KuCoin, and Lido have been supporting staking on this Beacon Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Although running, the Beacon Chain is not yet producing blocks for the mainnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## [[impact_of_ethereum_merge_on_gas_fees | Impact on Gas Fees]]
A common misconception is that the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] will lower gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, technically, the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] will not reduce gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Ethereum]] blockchain consists of three layers:
*   **Execution Layer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Consensus Layer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Data Availability Layer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>

The [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] primarily changes the consensus layer from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Gas fees are paid for operations on the execution layer, which will not see changes directly from the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Gas fees are influenced by supply and demand for block space, and the complexity of decentralized applications (dApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Reasons for The Merge
The [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] is being implemented for several key reasons:

### [[security_cost_and_scalability_improvements_in_ethereum | Lower Security Costs]]
Moving to Proof of Stake significantly reduces the cost of securing the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Setting up a Proof of Work mining rig is expensive and energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. By lowering security costs, more individuals can participate as validators, potentially even running a node on a Raspberry Pi (provided they have 32 ETH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:04:01]</a>. For those with less than 32 ETH, participation is possible through staking pools like Lido or Rocket Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### [[security_cost_and_scalability_improvements_in_ethereum | Scalability Improvements]]
The [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] is foundational for future scalability plans, including sharding (EIP-4844) and statelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Extending the capabilities of the blockchain is much easier with Proof of Stake compared to Proof of Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Implications and Benefits

### Reduced Network Operating Cost
The Proof of Stake mechanism enables a 99.9% reduction in network operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This is because it eliminates the need for expensive mining rigs, reducing energy and hardware costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### ETH Supply Reduction
The [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] is projected to cause a significant reduction in the daily supply of [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]]. Currently, approximately 13,500 [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] are issued daily from mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Post-merge, this daily issuance is expected to drop by 90%, to about 0.3% to 0.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

This reduction, combined with [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | EIP-1559]], which burns the base fee of transactions, can lead to [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Ethereum]] becoming deflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. During the peak of NFT activity, more [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] was burned than produced daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Since [[maximal_extractable_value_mev_on_ethereum | EIP-1559]] was implemented, about 2 million [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] have been burned, resulting in a net issuance of 1.2 million [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] over that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This mechanism aims to make [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] deflationary in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### [[staking_and_yield_changes_post_ethereum_merge | Staking Yield Increase]]
Staking yields are expected to increase by 50% to 100% after the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Currently, staking on platforms like Lido or KuCoin offers an APR of 3% to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Post-merge, the yield is anticipated to be around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Rewards will be given to stakers instead of miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Timeline and Release
While there's no specific date for the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]], it has already been launched on the Kiln testnet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. However, there are still implementation issues being addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Users can monitor the progress on websites like `whenmerger.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Unlocking Staked ETH
Currently, over 10 million [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] are staked and locked on the Beacon Chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Some are liquid staking via platforms like Lido <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Concerns exist that a sudden unlock of these funds could lead to a price crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

However, several factors mitigate this risk:
*   Not all 10 million [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] will be sold immediately, as users decide individually whether to sell or continue staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   There's a built-in queue system for withdrawals, limiting the release to a maximum of 1,125 validators (approximately 36,000 [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]]) per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   The anticipated 10% staking yield could incentivize holders to continue staking rather than selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   After the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]], there will be a period of six to eight months before withdrawals are enabled, during which no new [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] will be issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Staking Options
For individuals who wish to participate in staking but do not have the required 32 [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]], pooling options are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Platforms like Lido and Rocket Pool allow users to contribute as little as 0.1 [[the_merge_on_ethereum | ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. These platforms provide liquid staking tokens (e.g., stETH from Lido, rETH from Rocket Pool) which can be used in other DeFi protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The collapse of LUNA was attributed to several interconnected factors, with the core [[luna_and_ust_collapse | UST mechanism]] playing a significant role in its rapid decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The speaker, personally impacted by the liquidation of their LUNA position, described the past 72 hours as "super tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to LUNA's Downfall

### Coordinated Attack
A primary factor was a coordinated attack where attackers acquired 1 billion UST and loaned it for 3 billion BTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. After selling this BTC, it triggered a bank run on [[anchor_protocol_and_bluna_loans | Anchor Protocol]] as UST de-pegged, causing widespread panic and selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. An alleged attacker's Twitter thread celebrating their "victory lap" was mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### The Terra UST Mechanism
The fundamental design of the Terra [[decentralized_finance_on_terra_luna | UST mechanism]] created a "dead loop" or "vicious cycle" during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
*   When users sell UST, new LUNA tokens are minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   As more people sold UST due to de-pegging fears, the supply of LUNA continuously increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This ongoing minting put severe downward pressure on LUNA's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) Efforts
The Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) held a Bitcoin (BTC) reserve intended to stabilize UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, their continuous selling of BTC to defend UST's peg contributed to a broader market panic, alongside other macro events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Macroeconomic and Regulatory Environment
The crisis was exacerbated by negative macroeconomic data, persistent high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, and comments from the Treasury Secretary about UST, calling for regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Impact on LUNA
The combination of these factors led to a severe de-peg of UST and LUNA's price plummeting to less than 10 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Terra's stated priority was to re-peg UST, even if it meant continuing to burn UST and, consequently, minting more LUNA, further driving down LUNA's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The large sell-off of BTC also contributed to a decline in BTC's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, and at one point, USDT also briefly lost its peg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The speaker acknowledged the immense pain of the situation but expressed a belief in the crypto space and the need to persevere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

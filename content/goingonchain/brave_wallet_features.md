Brave Wallet is presented as an alternative to Metamask for managing cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

### Advantages

*   **Built-in functionality** Brave Wallet is built directly into the Brave browser, eliminating the need to download extra Chrome extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This integration is suggested to reduce risk to the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **User Interface (UI)** The UI of Brave Wallet is described as "super good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Multi-chain connectivity** Similar to Metamask, Brave Wallet can connect to various other blockchain networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Portfolio page** It includes a dedicated portfolio page that fetches token prices from CoinGecko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Weaknesses

*   **Coin tracker limitations** The coin tracking functionality of Brave Wallet is not considered very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   **LP token tracking** It is unable to track LP (Liquidity Pool) tokens, requiring users to add them manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   **Token recognition** The wallet may not automatically recognize new or certain tokens; for example, the "cre8r" token had to be added manually, whereas it would automatically appear in Metamask upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

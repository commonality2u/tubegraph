Dollar (DLR) is a stablecoin offered by Inverse Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Its primary appeal lies in the various [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | farming opportunities]] it presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Farming Opportunities

Yield farms for Dollar are available on both the Ethereum (ETH) and Fantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For swapping, users can utilize either Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Stabilizer Liquidity Pool

Stabilizer is Inverse Finance's proprietary liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is constructed from a DAI and Dollar (DLR) pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Key features of the Stabilizer pool include:
*   **Swap Fee** The swap fee is approximately 0.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Fixed Rate Guarantee** It guarantees a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidity** The pool holds about 4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Borrowing Dollar with xIMV

A notable feature within Inverse Finance is the ability to use xIMV as collateral to borrow Dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This functionality is part of Inverse Plus, an upgrade to their governance token system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

The process allows users to:
1.  Buy and supply IMV tokens.
2.  Earn IMV emissions (e.g., at 122% APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  Earn a share of the protocol revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
4.  Participate in governance through voting rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
5.  Use their supplied IMV (represented as xIMV) as collateral to [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | borrow stablecoins]] like Dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

For instance, if someone supplies $100 worth of IMV and borrows $30 of Dollar, the original $100 of IMV continues to earn its 122% APY (assuming it has not been liquidated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This mechanism demonstrates significant [[risks_and_benefits_of_investing_with_stablecoins | capital efficiency]], as funds are not locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

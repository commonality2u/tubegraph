## Overview
[[cyber_kongz_nft_and_bananas | CyberKongz]] is highlighted as an original pioneer for passive income generation within the NFT space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. There are 1,000 CyberKongz in total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. As of the transcript's recording, the floor price for a CyberKongz NFT is 155 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Passive Income Mechanism
Owning a CyberKongz NFT allows the holder to earn 10 "bananas" per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Each banana is valued at $0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, translating to a daily income of $7.50 per NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Banana Utility and Use Cases
The market for bananas is sustained by their various utilities within the CyberKongz ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, ensuring their value and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These utilities include:
*   **Setting a biography** for a CyberKongz NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>
*   **Renaming** a CyberKongz NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>
*   **Breeding** to produce "baby Kongz" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>

These utilities provide a practical use case for bananas, preventing them from being merely "farming tokens" that might be dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

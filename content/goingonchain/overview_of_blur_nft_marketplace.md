*   **Claim Deadline** Airdrop 1 had a 14-day claim period from October 19th, suggesting an end around the first week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Airdrop 2

Airdrop 2 is designed for users who missed Airdrop 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Eligibility** To qualify for Airdrop 2, users must list at least one NFT on the Blur platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Listing Process**
    *   NFTs can be listed on Blur directly or concurrently pushed to other marketplaces like LooksRare and OpenSea (X2Y2 was temporarily disabled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Users can easily set prices at floor price, top trade, or via a ladder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   An auto-adjust feature is available to account for all fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **[[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrop | Strategies to Maximize Airdrop]]** While no explicit formula is given, users can maximize their Airdrop 2 rewards by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:
    *   Listing more NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Listing more blue-chip NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   Listing NFTs from active collections, as they generate more volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **[[incentivized_royalties_and_loyalty_points_on_blur | Incentivized Royalties]]** Blur rewards users with Blur tokens if they choose to give royalties when listing their NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This encourages users to list more NFTs on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **[[incentivized_royalties_and_loyalty_points_on_blur | Loyalty Points]]** Every wallet has a loyalty point score <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Users gain high loyalty points if they list their NFT at the lowest price on Blur compared to other marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. High loyalty points increase the odds of receiving super rare care packages, which contain more Blur tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Token Release

Blur tokens are scheduled to be released in January 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Currently, the focus is on collecting care packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

[[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] is presented as a "very degen" play in the cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It garnered significant attention due to its "crazy APY," reminiscent of how Snowbank initially launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The project's team is anonymous, raising concerns about a potential rug pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is important to note that the very high APY is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The same anonymous team behind Snowbank also launched [[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Differences from OlympusDAO Forks

[[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] is not a typical [[Differences between SnowdogDAO and OlympusDAO forks | OlympusDAO fork]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. While the team utilizes the Olympus fork method to raise capital, their objective is to create a meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The 8-Day Cycle and Market Volatility

The [[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] project is designed to last for an 8-day cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>:

*   **Day 1 to Day 5**: Users can mint S-DOG tokens, which increases the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The vesting term for minting is 3 days, shorter than the typical 5 days seen in platforms like Wonderland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This period is similar to [[Differences between SnowdogDAO and OlympusDAO forks | OlympusDAO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Day 5 onwards**: Minting new tokens is no longer possible, but users can still redeem previously minted tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Day 8**: This is considered "the big day" where the price is expected to be "super volatile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. On this day, all collected assets (excluding the liquidity pool) will be swapped for Magic Internet Money (MIM), a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This MIM will then be used to buy S-DOG from the S-DOG/MIM liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The purchased S-DOG will be burnt, reducing the supply, and staking rewards will pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. After this, S-DOG will have a fixed supply and become a primary currency for the Avalanche ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Post-Day 8**: The token transitions into a meme token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

During the early stages, there was a dump on Snowbank's price, as people moved their liquidity to [[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. [[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]]'s price rapidly increased, reaching a peak of approximately $6,000 within less than a day of its launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Risks Associated with SnowdogDAO

*   **Anonymous Team**: The team behind [[SnowdogDAO and its structure | SnowdogDAO]] is anonymous, posing a risk of a rug pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable APY**: The extremely high APY is not sustainable in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Time-Sensitive**: Projects of this nature require investors to be "fast in, fast out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **New Project**: It is a new project and not a typical [[Differences between SnowdogDAO and OlympusDAO forks | OlympusDAO fork]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Degen Play**: The entire 8-day cycle is considered a "very degen play" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Meme Coin Outcome**: After the 8-day cycle, the token will become a meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## [[Cryptocurrency investment strategies | Investment Strategies]] for SnowdogDAO

For those considering a "degen" approach, two main strategies are outlined:

1.  **Minting with the Highest Discount**: Focus on minting from the S-DOG/MIM LP (Liquidity Pool) to secure the highest discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While the market price for S-DOG was around $5,400, it was possible to mint it at $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The vesting term for this is 3 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
2.  **Claiming and Managing Minted Tokens**: After each vesting period, you have two options:
    *   **Claim and Sell**: Claim the tokens and sell them at the current market price, especially if the market price is favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   **Claim and Auto-Stake**: Claim the tokens and auto-stake them to take advantage of the high APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

One personal strategy attempted was to "ape in" small amounts, redeeming and selling every few hours to try and recover capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

This article clarifies the difference between Supply APY and Stake APR on Hundred Finance, detailing how each is earned and their implications.

## Understanding Supply APY

When users supply stable or crypto assets to Hundred Finance, they earn a **Supply APY** on their deposited assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This means the earnings are based on the value of the supplied asset itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. As a receipt for supplying assets, users receive 'H' tokens (e.g., supplying MEM yields hMEM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

For example, supplying 500 MEM to Hundred Finance would only yield the Supply APY, such as 0.27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Understanding Stake APR

To earn the **Stake APR**, users must stake their 'H' tokens (receipt tokens) with Hundred Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. This staking action provides the higher APR, which is earned in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

For instance, staking hMEM would grant access to the Stake APR, like 18.89% on HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

## Supply and Stake Actions

A simplified breakdown of the actions:

*   **Supply**: Deposit stable or crypto assets to earn Supply APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. You receive 'H' tokens as a receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
*   **Stake**: Take your 'H' tokens and stake them to earn HND tokens via the Stake APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Distinction: Taking Loans vs. Staking Assets

A crucial difference between supplying and staking is their impact on borrowing:

*   If the objective is to [[taking_loans_vs_staking_assets | take a loan]], users should only supply their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   Once assets are staked, they can no longer be used as collateral to [[taking_loans_vs_staking_assets | take a loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

**Example Scenario:**
If 500 MEM are supplied, enabling a potential loan of 14,000 Spell tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. If 50% of the hMEM (receipt tokens) are then staked, the supply value and the available loan amount will both drop by half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Collecting HND Rewards

To withdraw HND rewards earned from staking, navigate to the HND section on the platform and select "collect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. A dashboard overview allows users to see their supply APR and staking APR for the HND token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Locking HND for veHND (Voting Escrow HND)

HND tokens can be locked up to earn more rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This process converts HND into veHND (voting escrow HND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The amount of veHND received depends on the lock-up duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>:

*   100 HND locked for 4 years yields 100 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   100 HND locked for 2 years yields 50 veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

If HND is added to an existing lock-up, it follows the previously committed lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Utilities of veHND

veHND offers two primary functions:

1.  **Voting for Pool Rewards**: Users can vote to direct more rewards to specific pools. Pools with more votes receive a higher average APR on HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Boosting Personal Rewards**: veHND can be used to boost a user's own staking rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. For example, a 1x APR of 18.87% on MEM can be boosted to 2.5x by applying veHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the veHND needed for a maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

Boosts and voting impacts apply after being triggered by a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Epochs and Reward Updates

Voting and reward changes occur in cycles called "epochs," which typically update every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. The effective APR for a pool can change in the next epoch based on voting distribution; for example, a boost could result in a 45% APR that then drops to 33% in the next epoch if another asset, like [[yield_and_apy_on_eth_and_usdc | USDC]], receives more votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. The remaining time until the next epoch's end is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

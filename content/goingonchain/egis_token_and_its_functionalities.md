EGIS is the native token of DC DAO, an Ohm fork with a unique twist [00:00:04]. The product is currently in preview and has not yet launched [00:00:06].

## Core Functionalities

Like other Ohm forks, EGIS tokens can be minted at a discount [00:00:18]. Users can choose to stake the token to earn interest, with an initial phase looking at a 50,000% APY [00:00:24]. When users mint EGIS tokens, DC DAO is able to build up its treasury [00:00:33].

A key functionality of EGIS is its role within DC DAO's planned decentralized exchange (DEX). This DEX aims to be filled with assets from other projects like wMEMO, Ohm, Hector, and Exodia [00:00:52]. On this [[Utility of DEX tokens | DEX]], users can swap EGIS tokens:
*   After a rebase, EGIS can be swapped for wMEMO [00:01:02].
*   Later, it can be swapped for Ohm [00:01:07].
*   Further, it can be swapped for Hector [00:01:09].
The team estimates that one full cycle could yield about 3.78%, and performing this three times a day could result in about 11.34% [00:01:14]. While this process is currently manual, the team is looking to automate it [00:01:23]. Users can choose to skip parts of the cycle, for example, doing EGIS to wMEMO to Ohm and then waiting for EGIS again [00:01:29]. The swap fees generated on the DEX will go into the treasury as revenue, potentially helping to fund the APY given to EGIS stakers [00:01:45].

## EGIS Tokenomics and Distribution

DC DAO is planning an "Initial [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] Offering" (INO) where users must buy an [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] to get an allocation for EGIS tokens [00:02:01]. This [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] sale will be an auction [00:02:10]. For example, acquiring a "Dante" tier [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] at 500 FTM could award a max of 600 FTM worth of EGIS allocation [00:02:25]. If FTM is $3 and EGIS is $1 at pre-sale, this means an option to buy $1920 worth of EGIS [00:02:31].

EGIS token distribution from the offering is as follows:
*   **80%** of the offering will go to the [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] auction, meaning a large portion of tokens will go to the public [00:03:02].
*   **10%** is kept by the team [00:03:12].
*   **10%** is allocated for initial liquidity supply [00:03:14].

The team's tokens have a vesting period of six months with a two-month cliff [00:03:19].

## Benefits from NFT Ownership

Owning certain tiers of [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFTs]] provides special boosts for EGIS token holders:
*   A "Dante" tier [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] grants a 2.5% boost in staking [00:02:41].
*   It also provides a 5% bonding boost [00:02:44].
*   Additionally, a lottery system exists where, for instance, a "Bronze Dante" [[Utility and Use Cases of NFT Tokens | NFT]] could provide an additional 25% allocation [00:02:47].

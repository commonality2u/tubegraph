New farming opportunities arise when [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] becomes available on different chains, including [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article outlines how to bridge [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] to [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]] and the yield opportunities available.

## Yield Opportunities on Avalanche

On [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]], users can find attractive yield opportunities with [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>:

*   **UST-AVAX Pool**: Offers a yield of up to 56% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, this pool carries the risk of impermanent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Stablecoin Pool**: Provides a yield of approximately 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This option is suitable for those concerned about impermanent loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## How to Bridge UST to Avalanche

To access these farming opportunities, you must first bridge your [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] from the Terra chain to the [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This process involves using the Satellite bridging software and the Keplr Wallet.

### Using Satellite Bridging Software

1.  **Select Source Chain and Asset**: Use Satellite to choose "Terra" as your source chain and [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] as your source asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  **Set Destination**: Input [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]] as your destination chain and provide your [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]] address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
3.  **Review Fees and Minimums**:
    *   A transfer fee of 0.1% applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   The minimum transfer amount is 15 [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Transfer**: Click "Connect Wallet and Transfer," which will trigger a signature request on your MetaMask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Signing this initiates a one-time deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Incorporating Keplr Wallet

A crucial step in this bridging process involves the Keplr Wallet, which is used for the Cosmo ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

1.  **Move UST to Keplr**: You must transfer your [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] from your Terra Station wallet to your Keplr wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  **Specify Amount**: Once [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] is in your Keplr wallet, input the desired transfer amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  **Approve Transaction**: Your Keplr wallet will prompt you to approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This transaction costs approximately 0.004 LUNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  **Completion**: After approval, the transaction typically takes three to five minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
5.  **Verify Funds**: Your [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] should then appear in your MetaMask wallet on the [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Utilizing Bridged UST for Farming

Once your [[how_to_bridge_ust_to_avalanche_using_keplr_wallet | UST]] is on [[tutorial_on_avalanche_usage | Avalanche]], you can use it for farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, you can go to Pangolin, choose the deposit option, and participate in stablecoin farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Hundred Finance allows users to earn rewards through supplying and staking crypto assets. Understanding the difference between Supply APY and Staked APR, and how to utilize [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND tokens]] for boosting rewards, is key to maximizing earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Supply APY vs. Staked APR
When you supply a stablecoin or crypto asset on Hundred Finance, you earn a Supply APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. As a receipt for your supplied assets, you receive an [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | hToken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For example, supplying MEM tokens will yield hMEM as a receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

The Staked APR on HND tokens is *only* earned if you stake your [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | hToken]] receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Simply supplying an asset (e.g., 500 MEM) will only yield the Supply APY (e.g., 0.27% APY) and *not* the HND Staked APR (e.g., 18.89% APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. To earn HND, you must supply *and* stake your [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | hToken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Staking's Impact on Loans
It is important to note that once you stake your [[using_htokens_and_earning_hnd | hToken]], you will no longer be able to take a loan against that collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. If your objective is to take a loan, you should only supply your asset and take the loan, without staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Staking even a portion of your supplied assets will reduce your available borrowing limit proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Collecting HND Rewards
To withdraw your earned HND rewards, navigate to the HND section on the platform and click "Collect" on the right side of the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This dashboard also provides an overview of your Supply APY and Staking APR for the HND token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | Locking HND for veHND Tokens]]
Once you have HND tokens, you can [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | lock them up]] to earn more rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This is done on the "Vote" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. By [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | locking HND]], you receive [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The amount of [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] you receive depends on the lock-up period:
*   100 HND locked for 4 years yields 100 [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   100 HND locked for 2 years yields 50 [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
If you add more HND to an existing lock-up, the new tokens will follow the previously committed lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Utilizing [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] for Boosting Rewards
[[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] provides two primary functions:
1.  **[[voting_and_boosting_apr_using_mvehnd | Voting for Pool Rewards]]**: You can vote to direct more HND rewards to specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Pools that receive more votes will have a higher average APR on their HND rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This mechanism is similar to [[voting_incentives_and_their_effects_on_dex_token_prices | voting incentives]] seen in other DeFi protocols.
2.  **[[using_hnd_tokens_for_boosting_yield | Boosting Your Own Rewards]]**: You can use [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] to boost your individual HND rewards from a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For example, an initial APR of 18.87% can be boosted up to 2.5x with sufficient [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Hundred Finance provides a calculator to determine the amount of [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]] needed for the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

To apply your boost, after [[locking_hnd_for_vehnd_rewards | locking HND]] and receiving [[vehnd_and_mvehnd_tokens | veHND]], click "Apply" on the voting page to trigger a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This will update your individual APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Voting Cycles (Epochs)
Votes for rewards are processed in cycles called "epochs," which typically occur every 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The distribution of rewards and resulting APRs can change in subsequent epochs based on new voting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The platform displays a timer indicating when the current epoch ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Freelancers and independent contractors often face challenges with non-payment or disagreements regarding work standards from clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. In Singapore, resources exist to guide fair and progressive contracts for freelancers, emphasizing the need for formal agreements to avoid "your words versus my words" situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While traditional Web2 platforms like Fiverr or Upwork offer solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, the Web3 space introduces innovative alternatives, such as platforms built on blockchain technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Trust Treaty: A Web3 Example

Trust Treaty is a Web3 [[escrow_services_in_web_3_for_freelancers | escrow service]] that operates as a refundable smart contract, designed to secure freelance agreements on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It addresses common pain points by ensuring commitment from both parties.

### How Trust Treaty Works

1.  **Contract Creation**:
    *   A client (e.g., Alice) looking to hire a service provider (e.g., Bob) creates a new contract on the Trust Treaty platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   The contract requires a title, critical information outlining expectations from both sides, start and end dates, and the agreed-upon price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   The price can be locked in USD, USDT, or USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Platform fees and potential [[dispute_resolution_in_web_3_freelance_contracts | dispute]] costs are factored in, which decrease with higher contract values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   When the client commits the payment, the funds are moved to a new wallet address secured by the platform, to which neither the client nor the service provider has direct access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   Users are represented by their wallet addresses, allowing for anonymous engagement (e.g., hiring an unknown designer who shows work on Twitter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

2.  **Contract Signing**:
    *   Once all information is filled, the client signs the contract, generating a unique link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   This link is shared with the service provider, who reviews the details and settlement value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Upon agreement, the service provider signs the contract, making it effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

3.  **Work and Payment**:
    *   The platform provides a UI for communication between the client and service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   When the work is finished, the service provider can request payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   If the client approves, they finalize the agreement, releasing funds to the service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### [[dispute_resolution_in_web_3_freelance_contracts | Dispute Resolution]]

*   If issues arise, either party can open a [[dispute_resolution_in_web_3_freelance_contracts | dispute]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Both client and service provider submit evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Two independent dispute agents analyze the situation and provide their assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   If both agents agree, their decision is final, and funds are disbursed accordingly (to provider or refunded to client) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   If they disagree, a manager is called in to make the final decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Use Cases and Benefits

*   Platforms like Trust Treaty are particularly useful for the growing amount of remote work in the Web3 space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   They provide a structured and secure way to manage agreements, ensuring payment security for freelancers and clear terms for clients.

### [[risks_and_considerations_in_using_web_3_platforms_for_freelancers | Risks and Considerations]]

*   **Platform Risk**: If the platform ceases to exist, the funding wallet (which holds the locked funds) also becomes inaccessible because the keys are not held by the client or service provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Dispute Decision Bias**: Although dispute agents make independent decisions, human bias might still be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The Trust Treaty platform currently does not have its own token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Wonderland is shifting its focus towards wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## What is wMEMO?
When you [[staking_on_wonderland_time | stake TIME]], you receive MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. wMEMO is the wrapped version of staked TIME, meaning it incorporates both the price of TIME and all the rebases (interest earned) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Using wMEMO
Converting to wMEMO is recommended due to the expanded possibilities it offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These include:

*   **Borrowing Stablecoins**: You can use [[how_to_use_wmemo_on_platforms_like_abracadabra_and_sushi | wMEMO on Abracadabra]] to borrow MIM stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Provision**: Become a liquidity provider on [[how_to_use_wmemo_on_platforms_like_abracadabra_and_sushi | SushiSwap]] by pairing your wMEMO with MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Structured Products**: Utilize the Pendle service to break down your wMEMO into structured products like OT-wMEMO (TIME value) and YT-wMEMO (yield value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If you anticipate Wonderland's interest rates will decline, you can sell your YT-wMEMO and buy OT-wMEMO to lock in your current yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Overall, wMEMO provides more avenues to [[investment_strategies_for_wmemo_spell_and_ice | increase your yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## How to Obtain wMEMO
If you are already [[staking_on_wonderland_time | staking on Wonderland]], you can find a "wrap" function on their website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Clicking this allows you to wrap your MEMO into wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To convert back, simply click the arrow to unwrap wMEMO to MEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Important Note on Quantity
The quantity of your wMEMO token remains constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. However, the amount of MEMO you can unwrap from your wMEMO changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For example, if you return five days later with the same wMEMO quantity, you will find that the MEMO quantity you can unwrap has increased, as it includes the price of TIME and earned rebases (interest) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Tracking wMEMO Value
You do not need to repeatedly wrap and unwrap to check the value of your wMEMO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A service called "The Bank" is available to [[tracking_the_value_of_wmemo | track the value of your wMEMO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Airdrop Eligibility
Holding wMEMO makes you [[eligibility_for_wonderland_airdrops_with_wmemo | eligible for Wonderland airdrops]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This applies if you hold wMEMO on Avalanche, Ethereum, or Phantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

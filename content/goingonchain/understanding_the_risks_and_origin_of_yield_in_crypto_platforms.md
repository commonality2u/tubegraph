During volatile economic periods with rising interest rates, it becomes crucial for crypto assets to generate returns. One strategy is to aim for 6% to 8% yield on holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Current Challenges with Centralized Finance (CeFi) Platforms

Many CeFi platforms have faced significant issues, including withdrawal freezes or bankruptcy, often due to exposure to entities like Terra or 3AC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Examples of services affected include Hodlnaut and Finblox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While withdrawing assets from these services mitigates immediate risk, it also means the assets are no longer earning yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Ways to Earn Yield on Crypto Assets

There are several methods to earn yield on crypto assets:

### 1. Parking Assets on Centralized Exchanges (CeFi)
Many crypto exchanges offer services to lend out or "park" crypto assets to earn interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **Lending Programs:** Platforms like KuCoin allow users to lend out crypto assets for interest over specified terms (e.g., 7 or 14 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Earn Products:** "KuCoin Earn" enables parking [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] or Bitcoin to earn a certain Annual Percentage Rate (APR), with flexible or fixed tenures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such services are commonly available across most crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### 2. Parking Assets in Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
[[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | DeFi]] offers ways to earn yield directly on the blockchain:
*   **Liquid Staking:** Protocols like Lido or Rocket Pool allow users to stake Ethereum (ETH) and receive rewards, typically around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Running a dedicated node for staking can yield higher ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### 3. Self-Custody and Price Appreciation
The safest option is to store assets in a personal wallet and wait for crypto asset price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This approach adheres to the principle "not your keys, not your coin," meaning full control over assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Case Study: Earning Yield on FTX

The FTX app offers a simplified interface primarily for buying, selling, depositing, and withdrawing assets, without a complex trading interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Transfers of ERC20 tokens from FTX Pro to the FTX app are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Yield Structure:** The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) on FTX is structured to offer 8% on the first $10,000, and 5% on amounts exceeding $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This results in a blended APY (e.g., 6.1% for larger balances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Other assets like Ethereum also share the same APY structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Information:**
    *   Without Know Your Customer (KYC) verification, the maximum withdrawal is $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   International wire transfers to foreign currency (USD) bank accounts are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals of USDC to MetaMask or other crypto wallets are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Understanding the Risks and Origin of Yield

### Risks Associated with Yield Platforms
It is crucial to understand that earning yield on crypto platforms is **not risk-free** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A significant risk is **platform risk**; if the exchange (e.g., FTX) experiences issues or freezes withdrawals, all assets held on the platform could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | prudent risk management]] and diversification to ensure some assets continue to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Not Risk-Free
> Earning yield on crypto platforms like FTX is not risk-free. Platform failure or withdrawal freezes can lead to total loss of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Where Does the Yield Come From?
Understanding the origin of the yield is essential, as someone must be paying for the returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. While there isn't always a fixed or transparent answer, common explanations include:
*   **Lending to the Platform:** Users might be lending their assets directly to the platform (e.g., FTX) for their operational activities, such as margin trading and lending services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Liquidity for Lending/Borrowing:** The assets could be used as a source of liquidity for other users engaging in lending and borrowing activities on the platform (e.g., via FTX Pro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy:** A portion of the yield might be subsidized by the platform's marketing budget to attract and retain users on their app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

CitaDAO is a platform that integrates blockchain technology with real estate, distinct from other DeFi projects due to its backing by physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The platform aims to bring commercial building properties on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## How CitaDAO Works: The IRO Process

CitaDAO introduces properties on-chain through a process called **IRO (Introducing Real Estate On-chain)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

During an IRO:
*   Commercial building owners interested in bringing their property on-chain are sought by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.
*   Participants commit a minimum sum, typically in USDC, into a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   The commitment period for an IRO is typically 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   Funds committed by participants cannot be withdrawn until the IRO process concludes, regardless of its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### IRO Outcomes

*   **Successful IRO:** If the minimum committed sum is met, tokens and rewards are distributed to participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The committed USDC is swapped for RET (Real Estate Token) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Unsuccessful IRO:** If the minimum sum is not met, the committed funds are refunded to the participants, and the property is not brought on-chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## IRO Rewards

CitaDAO provides IRO rewards directly to participants and supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This mechanism replaces fees that would typically be paid to third-party agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

**Reward Calculation Example:**
If the fair value of a property is $100,000 and the daily reward is $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>:
*   If a participant commits $1,000 on Day 1 and no one else participates, they receive 100% of the daily reward ($1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   If another participant commits $9,000 on Day 2, the initial participant would then receive 10% of the reward based on their proportional commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## CitaDAO Tokens

*   **RET (Real Estate Token):** This token is received by participants when an IRO is successful, swapped from their committed USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. RET can be sold on Uniswap or used to earn the governance token, Knight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Knight:** This is CitaDAO's governance token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Owning Knight provides exposure to other properties listed on the platform, as CitaDAO takes 2% of all listed properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## First Project: Cardiff Building

The first project on CitaDAO is the Cardiff Building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While the IRO date is yet to be announced, further details can be found on their Discord channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Key details about the Cardiff Building IRO:
*   **Duration:** 10 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Property Details:** A detailed page is available, highlighting the property's fair value, stable income, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **IRO Value:** The target value to be met is approximately $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **IRO Reward:** The total reward for the Cardiff Building IRO is about $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

CitaDAO presents an interesting project due to its physical asset backing, providing a unique value proposition for its tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

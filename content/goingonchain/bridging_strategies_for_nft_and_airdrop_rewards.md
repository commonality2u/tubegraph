This article provides a breakdown of bridging strategies for the [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | Arbitrum Odyssey]] campaign, focusing on maximizing exposure to potential [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | airdrops]] and [[token_distribution_and_rewards | NFT rewards]].

## Understanding the Arbitrum Odyssey Campaign

The [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | Arbitrum Odyssey]] is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to interact with Arbitrum [00:00:45]. By participating, users can receive NFTs [00:00:52]. While the value of these NFTs is uncertain, there is [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | speculation]] that participation might be a criterion for a future airdrop from Arbitrum itself [00:00:58]. Additionally, some projects involved in the Odyssey do not yet have tokens, offering a chance to qualify for their respective [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | airdrops]] by trying them out [00:01:02].

The campaign concludes on June 27th, 13:00 Eastern Time (June 28th, 01:00 Singapore time) [00:00:32].

### Week 1: Bridging Week

The first week of the Odyssey is "Bridging Week" [00:01:11]. The primary goal is to move ETH to Arbitrum [00:01:13]. To qualify for the [[token_distribution_and_rewards | NFT reward]], users must use a selected list of bridges [00:01:18].

Key details for bridging:
*   **Asset Counted:** Only ETH (Ether) [00:01:40].
*   **Minimum Sum:** There is no minimum amount required to bridge [00:01:46].
*   **Multiple Bridges:** Users can utilize multiple bridges [00:01:48].
*   **Bonus NFT:** An extra bonus NFT can be earned by using the bridge that facilitates the highest number of wallet bridges [00:01:26]. As of reporting, Hop is leading in wallet activity, with Celer Network close behind [00:02:50].

## [[strategies_to_maximize_blur_token_airdrop | Strategies for Airdrop Exposure]]

A core strategy for maximizing potential [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | airdrop opportunities]] is to use [[bridges_without_tokens_and_additional_incentives | bridges that do not currently have their own tokens]] [00:02:04]. The [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | speculation]] is that using these bridges could qualify participants for their potential future airdrops, effectively "killing two birds with one stone" [00:02:09].

Four such [[bridges_without_tokens_and_additional_incentives | bridges without tokens]] that are being tested include [00:02:26]:
*   Lifi [00:02:35]
*   Bungee [00:02:35]
*   Hashflow [00:02:35]
*   Hop (though Hop has a token, it offers additional incentives) [00:02:50]

### [[bridges_without_tokens_and_additional_incentives | Additional Incentives from Bridges]]

Several bridges are offering their own incentives in addition to the [[collecting_nfts_and_airdrops_in_arbitrum_odyssey | Arbitrum Odyssey]] NFTs:

*   **Lifi:** Lifi has stated they are rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details on these "retracted rewards" were not immediately available [00:03:07].
*   **Hashflow:** Hashflow is giving out a limited edition NFT that winners can redeem for their token at launch [00:03:21]. This allows for swapping any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum, not just ETH [00:03:30].
    *   Winning criteria: Top 100 participants with the highest total volume bridged, and 100 randomly selected lucky winners [00:03:37].
*   **Bungee:** To qualify for Bungee's additional incentive, users need to be among the top 1,000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction [00:03:54].
*   **Hop:** Hop is offering a "small brand NFT" as a special gift to 10 lucky "hoppers" who bridge with them [00:04:03].

## Practical Considerations for Bridging

When bridging, it's important to consider both gas fees and slippage [00:04:53].

*   **Slippage:** Bridging can result in slippage, meaning you receive slightly less than the expected amount on the destination chain [00:04:20]. For example, a 0.1 ETH swap might yield 0.0972 ETH [00:04:19].
*   **Aggregator Bridges:** Bridges like Bungee act as aggregators, pulling information from various sources to find the route with the highest return for the user [00:04:39]. Users can also choose to prioritize lower gas fees over the highest return [00:04:49].

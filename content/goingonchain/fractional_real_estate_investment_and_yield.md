Tangible is a marketplace that converts real-world assets into NFTs, facilitating crypto adoption for tangible items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. One of the real assets available on Tangible for investment is real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Investing in Real Estate Fractions

On Tangible, users can acquire a fraction of a real estate property or purchase all fractions to own the entire asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Yield Calculation & Fees
The primary focus for real estate investments on Tangible is on [[investment_profits_and_calculations | capital and rental yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For instance, a property might have a rent of $494 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The net yield, inclusive of capital appreciation and rental yield, could be around 15.17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

It's important to note that the stated yield will be affected by management and other fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, as Tangible handles the legal maintenance and related paperwork for the property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Purchase Requirements & Yield Activation
There is a minimum fraction required for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[real_yield_in_defi | Yield]] generation does not begin immediately upon purchasing a fraction; all property fractions must be sold out before yield starts to come in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The platform allows users to view the available fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Real Estate Backed Stablecoin (USDR)
Real estate assets managed by Tangible are also used to back a stablecoin called USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

USDR is an over-collateralized stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, backed by a mix of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, DAI, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Learning from incidents like the UST depeg, Tangible ensures that USDR avoids a "death spiral" by requiring at least 88% of its backing to come from other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Only after this threshold is met can their native token be used to mint USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, Tangible intends to subsidize this yield to push it to a range of 6% to 9%, as they consider 4.25% to be low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

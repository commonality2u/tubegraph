Arbitrage opportunities can arise in the NFT space, often exploiting specific tokenomics or market inefficiencies. One notable instance involved a flash loan to capitalize on an ApeCoin (Acoin) airdrop for Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## ApeCoin Airdrop Mechanism

The ApeCoin token was initially valued at approximately $13 per token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Holding a BAYC NFT entitled the owner to about 10,000 Acoin tokens, which at the time equated to approximately $130,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

A key aspect of this airdrop was that there was no snapshot date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. As long as someone owned a BAYC NFT, they could withdraw the Acoin tokens once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This unique characteristic caused the floor price of BAYC NFTs to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Exploiting the Airdrop with a Flash Loan

An individual leveraged a technique known as a flash loan to execute an arbitrage strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Flash Loan Explained
A flash loan allows users to borrow a large amount of assets with a low cost, provided the borrowed amount is repaid within the same blockchain transaction block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For those interested in learning more about flash loans, Aave (RVA) offers documentation and tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### The Strategy
The individual found a vault on NFTX containing five BAYC NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. These BAYC NFTs in the vault had not yet claimed their Acoin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The process involved a single Ethereum transaction:
1.  **Borrow BAYC**: The individual used a flash loan to borrow the five BAYC NFTs from the NFTX vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Claim Acoin**: Immediately after borrowing, the individual used these BAYC NFTs to claim approximately 60,000 Acoin tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
3.  **Return BAYC**: The borrowed BAYC NFTs were returned to the NFTX vault within the same transaction block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
4.  **Sell Acoin**: The newly claimed Acoin tokens were then sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Through this series of actions within a single transaction, the individual reportedly profited approximately $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This specific case highlights how a "no snapshot" airdrop combined with flash loan capabilities created a significant [[arbitrage_opportunity_on_terra|arbitrage opportunity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

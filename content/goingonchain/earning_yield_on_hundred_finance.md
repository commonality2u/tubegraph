[[hundred_finance_overview | Hundred Finance]] operates as a multi-chain lending and borrowing platform, similar to Compound, and is currently active on several networks, including the Fantom network, which the speaker frequently uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The core functionality involves lending and borrowing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. There are five primary ways to earn yield on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Five Ways to Earn Yield

### 1. [[supplying_assets_for_yield | Supplying Assets and Borrowing Stables]]

This strategy involves supplying an asset as collateral and then borrowing a stablecoin against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The borrowed stablecoin is then supplied and staked back into Hundred Finance to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For example, supplying ETH as collateral to borrow MIM (a stablecoin), then supplying and staking MIM to earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The staking reward is paid in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This approach aims to make supplied assets work harder to generate more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

**Boosting APR with veHND**
To significantly increase the APR, for instance, from 11.11% to 27%, users need to acquire and lock up HND tokens to receive veHND (Vote Escrowed HND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This can be done via the "Vote" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. With veHND, users can vote for the gauge associated with their supplied asset (e.g., MIM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A boost calculator is available, allowing for a maximum boost of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, staking $3,000 and locking 300 HND for four years can achieve the 2.5x boost, while locking for one year yields a 1.46x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The platform provides an estimated APR for these boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### 2. Backstop Provision

Users can earn yield by participating in the backstop provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Instead of simply lending USDC, users can provide liquidity to help the platform execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Supplying USDC for this purpose can yield an estimated APR of 8.79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### 3. Leverage Long or Short

Hundred Finance allows users to engage in [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | leveraged long]] or [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | leveraged short]] positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Leverage Long**: To leverage long on a crypto asset, one supplies a crypto asset as collateral, borrows stablecoins, and then uses those stablecoins to buy more of the desired asset on a decentralized exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If the asset's price increases, the user sells the appreciated asset, repays the stablecoin loan, and profits from the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Leverage Short**: To leverage short, one supplies a stablecoin or crypto asset, borrows the crypto asset they wish to short, and immediately sells that borrowed asset for stablecoins on a DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. If the asset's price decreases, the user can withdraw their stablecoins, buy back the borrowed asset at a lower price, and repay the loan, profiting from the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
Hundred Finance provides detailed documentation and examples on how to execute these leverage strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### 4. Providing Liquidity

Users can earn yield by providing liquidity to specific pools within the Hundred Finance ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. An example mentioned is adding liquidity to the HND pool on "Bits," which is proportionate to 60% HND, 20% FTM (Fantom), and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This particular liquidity provision offers a combined APR of 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 5. Using Lendy

Lendy is a specialized deployment by Hundred Finance where the team borrows USDC from users, using HND as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The purpose of this is to provide liquidity to the HND/WFTM pool in Solidly, which in turn allows them to receive SOLID emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Users who provide USDC to Lendy can earn an APR of 34.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Rewards can be claimed under the "Claim HND" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This is considered a highly attractive yield for stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

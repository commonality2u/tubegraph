Hundred Finance is a multi-chain lending and borrowing platform, similar to Compound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It operates on several networks, with the presenter primarily using it on the Fantom network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The core utility of Hundred Finance involves lending and borrowing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Ways to Earn Yield on Hundred Finance

Here are five methods for earning yield on Hundred Finance:

### 1. Supplying Assets and Borrowing Stablecoins

This strategy involves supplying a crypto asset as collateral and then borrowing a stablecoin. The borrowed stablecoin is then supplied and staked back into Hundred Finance to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

*   **Process Example**: Supply ETH as collateral, borrow MIM, then supply and stake the MIM back into Hundred Finance to earn approximately 11.11% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The staked reward is paid in `HND` tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Yield Boost**: To achieve higher yields, such as 27%, users need to buy and lock `HND` tokens to receive `veHND` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. `veHND` allows users to vote on gauges, directing rewards to specific assets like MIM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A boost calculator is available, with a maximum boost of 2.5x achievable by locking `HND` for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, locking `HND` for one year could provide a 1.46x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   This method is considered a way to make assets like ETH "work harder" than traditional staking methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### 2. Participating in Backstop Provision

Users can provide liquidity to the platform's backstop mechanism, which is used to execute liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. By depositing USDC into the backstop pool, users can earn an approximate 8.79% eAPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### 3. Leveraging Long or Short Positions

Hundred Finance allows users to execute [[staking_and_borrowing_strategies_on_hundred_finance | leverage long or short strategies]] on crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Leverage Long**: Supply a crypto asset, borrow stablecoins, and then use the stablecoins to buy more of the crypto asset you wish to long on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. If the asset's price increases, you can sell a portion, repay the loan, and keep the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Leverage Short**: Supply stablecoins or crypto assets, borrow the crypto asset you wish to short, and then sell the borrowed asset for stablecoins on a DEX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. If the asset's price decreases, you can use the stablecoins to buy back the asset at a lower price and repay the loan, profiting from the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Hundred Finance provides documentation and examples for these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### 4. Providing Liquidity

Users can [[providing_liquidity_and_using_lendi_on_hundred_finance | provide liquidity]] to specific pools to earn yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For example, liquidity can be added to the `HND`/FTM/USDC pool, which has a proportionate split of 60% `HND`, 20% FTM, and 20% USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This pool offers a combined APR of 110% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 5. Using Lendi

Lendi is a dedicated deployment by Hundred Finance where the team borrows USDC from users, using `HND` as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This borrowed USDC is used to provide liquidity on the `HND`/wFTM pool in Solidly, earning Solidly emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Users who [[providing_liquidity_and_using_lendi_on_hundred_finance | provide USDC]] to Lendi can earn an APR of 34.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Rewards can be claimed under the "stake" and "claim HND" sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This is considered a strong yield, especially for stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Hundred Finance offers diverse strategies for users to earn yield through its lending and borrowing platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

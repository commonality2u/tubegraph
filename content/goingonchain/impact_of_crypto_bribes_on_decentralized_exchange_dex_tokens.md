## Understanding Crypto Bribes

Traditionally, bribes are often under the table and about incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] are different because they are open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In this system, a protocol openly tells a [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX token]] holder to vote for them, and in return, the holder can receive a share of the bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For example, a bribe could be worth about 100k of F-Beats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A project might offer up to 100k in value (e.g., VIS) to [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX token]] holders who vote for their protocol, attracting holders even if they are not from the specific pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Traditional DEX Token Dynamics

Prior to the widespread use of [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]], [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | stakers]] primarily farmed for [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Protocols often sought high liquidity, and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] were key to achieving this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A significant challenge was that [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] were often ready to sell or "dump" their [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]] at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## How Crypto Bribes Transform the Game

[[understanding_crypto_bribes | Crypto bribes]] introduce a new dynamic to [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEXes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEXes]] begin to allocate a portion of their token emissions (e.g., 30%) based on votes, with the protocol receiving the highest votes getting the largest share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. An example of this is Beats, which announced 30% of its token emission would be distributed this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Impact on Protocols and Liquidity

With this new system, protocols actively compete for votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. By securing more votes, they can increase the [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX token]] rewards for their pools, which in turn attracts more [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | liquidity providers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This can also encourage participants to buy the protocol's own tokens to chase higher Annual Percentage Rates (APR), as seen with Sharp, where high APR helped push up its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Protocols can also choose to buy [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]], which adds buying pressure to the [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, continuous buying isn't sustainable due to price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This is where [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] become a strategic tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Impact on DEX Token Holders

[[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Liquidity providers]] are less willing to sell their [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]] because they need them to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They typically vote for their own pools to increase their chances of winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Similarly, [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | stakers]], who already hold [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]], have no reason to sell them; instead, they can use them to vote and earn more yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

This system creates [[voting_incentives_and_their_effects_on_dex_token_prices | aligned incentives]]:
*   [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | Stakers]] and [[role_of_liquidity_providers_and_stakers_in_dex_token_systems | LPs]] are incentivized to hold their [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]] for voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   [[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Traders]] benefit from low slippage and high liquidity on the [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]], leading to more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   [[role_of_traders_and_protocols_in_dex | Protocols]] benefit from high liquidity and participants buying their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Overall, this adds buying pressure to the [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX token]] as holders seek to get more of the bribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Case Studies

### Beats
Prior to January of a given year, the Beats token often faced selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. However, starting January 6th, Beats began offering [[understanding_crypto_bribes | bribes]], allocating 30% of its emission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This led to increased voting and traction, with more people wanting the Beats token, which generated sustained buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While selling pressure isn't entirely eliminated, [[understanding_crypto_bribes | bribes]] significantly strengthen buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Spirit Swap
Another [[understanding_decentralized_exchanges | DEX]] implementing [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] is Spirit Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Greater DAO, for example, is offering bribes through Spirit Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This aligned incentive structure provides a compelling reason to hold [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]] and participate in [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]], also adding buying pressure to the greater token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Conclusion

When investing in [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX tokens]], it is beneficial to look for incentive setups where all stakeholders are aligned through mechanisms like [[understanding_crypto_bribes | crypto bribes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Without such alignment, a [[utility_of_dex_tokens | DEX token]] might simply remain a "farming token" susceptible to selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

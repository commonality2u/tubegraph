Cap Finance is a [[decentralized_finance_and_yield_reserves | protocol]] that offers [[real_yield_in_defi | real yield]] opportunities, although it is considered a degen, low-cap project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It is important to note that this information is for knowledge sharing and is not financial advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Current Yields on Cap Finance

As of the current data, Cap Finance provides significant [[supply_apy_vs_stake_apr | yield]] percentages for liquidity providers:
*   **ETH (if)**: Approximately 69% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>
*   **[[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | USDC]]**: Approximately 34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   **Staking CAP tokens**: Around 11.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## How Cap Finance Works

Cap Finance functions as a decentralized exchange for synthetic assets, currently supporting ETH and BTC pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Traders can engage with up to 50x leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Liquidity Pool and Counterparty System
The protocol ensures liquidity by having traders trade against a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This pool is composed of ETH and [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | USDC]], acting as the counterparty to the traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   If a trader wins, they take profit from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   If a trader loses, the asset goes into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   In the event of liquidation, a portion of the liquidated asset also goes into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Notably, if a trader loses 100% of their position, the entire amount goes into the ETH and [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | USDC]] pool, which makes it very appealing for liquidity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This specific detail was found through Discord, as it is not explicitly highlighted in the official documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Source of Yields

The [[lessons_from_high_apy_yield_farming | attractive yields]] on Cap Finance are primarily derived from the losses incurred by traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Essentially, liquidity providers act as the "house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations for Liquidity Providers

Providing liquidity to the Cap Finance pool is not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Trader Wins**: If a group of traders achieve significant wins, they will take profits from the pool, which could lead to a situation where liquidity providers do not get back their full deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Fees**: There is a 1% fee for withdrawals from both the ETH and [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | USDC]] pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Lock-up**: A 24-hour lock-up period is enforced, meaning funds cannot be withdrawn during the first 24 hours after being deposited into the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Yield**: The yield is dynamic and can decrease as more funds enter the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Comparison and Differentiation

Cap Finance operates in the same space as other perpetual decentralized exchanges like GMX and Gains, which are early leaders and have significant trading volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Cap Finance's market cap is approximately 12.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Its primary differentiation strategy is to offer **no fees** on trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The aim is to create a flywheel effect:
*   No fees attract more traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   More traders lead to more volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   More volume leads to more liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

For a [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | DeFi]] user, Cap Finance offers fee-free trading, though it lacks a stop-loss feature and has liquidation set at 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Alternatively, users can choose to be the "house" market maker and enjoy the pooling benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## CAP Token and Financial Metrics

Holding the native CAP token signifies bullishness on the protocol's potential, possibly seeing it as the next GMX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, it's important to note that the CAP token currently offers no governance rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Therefore, buying the token primarily provides exposure to the protocol's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

When comparing Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratios:
*   GMX has a P/E ratio of approximately 14.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Cap Finance, based on current numbers and considering total revenue shares to holders, has a P/E ratio of around 9.87 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Users can verify these numbers and perform their own analysis using resources like Token Terminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

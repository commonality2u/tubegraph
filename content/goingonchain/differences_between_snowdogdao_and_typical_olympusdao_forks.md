From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 
[[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] is presented as a "degen" play with a unique structure, differentiating it from typical OlympusDAO forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Core Differences

The primary distinction is that [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] is designed to raise capital for a meme coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> and operates on a fixed 8-day timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Operational Phases

While days 1 to 5 of [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] function similarly to OlympusDAO, allowing for the minting of S-DOG tokens, significant changes occur from day 5 to day 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Minting Period**:
    *   **[[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]]**: Minting of S-DOG tokens is possible from day 1 to day 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   **Typical OlympusDAO Forks**: Minting is generally continuous and not time-restricted in the same way.
*   **Vesting Term**:
    *   **[[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]]**: The vesting period for minted tokens is three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   **Typical OlympusDAO Forks (e.g., Wonderland)**: Vesting terms are typically five days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Post-Minting Phase (Day 5 onwards)**:
    *   **[[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]]**: Minting ceases on day 5, though redemption of previously minted tokens is still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   **Typical OlympusDAO Forks**: Minting typically continues indefinitely.

### Day 8 Event and Token Transformation

A major divergence occurs on day 8:

*   **Asset Conversion**: All assets held by [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] (excluding the liquidity pool) will be swapped for MIM (Magic Internet Money), a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Token Buyback and Burn**: The MIM will then be used to buy S-DOG from the S-DOG/MIM liquidity pool, and the purchased S-DOG will be burnt, reducing its total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Staking Rewards Pause**: Staking rewards for S-DOG will be paused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Fixed Supply Meme Token**: After this event, S-DOG will have a fixed supply and become the main currency for "avec" (likely a typo for "Avalanche" or "Avax") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Ultimately, the project will result in users owning a meme token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Risk Factors

Similar to other degen plays, [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] carries significant risks:

*   **Team Anonymity**: The team behind [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]], also responsible for [[staking_on_snowbank | Snowbank]], remains anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Rug Pull Potential**: Due to anonymity, the possibility of a rug pull exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable APY**: The initial high APY is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **High Volatility**: The price of S-DOG is expected to be highly volatile, especially on day 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **New Project**: It is a new project and not a typical OlympusDAO fork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is considered a very "degen" play due to its anonymous team and time-limited, speculative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. It is recommended to be "fast in, fast out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This is not financial advice; users should conduct their own research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

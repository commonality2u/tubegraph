Anchor Protocol is a platform designed for peer-to-peer lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. While lenders can [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | deposit money]] and earn a high interest, borrowers utilize crypto as [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## How Borrowing with Collateral Works

When a user wants to borrow money on Anchor, they must [[staking_luna_for_rewards | stake]] their crypto as [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This means the borrower's crypto is locked as security for the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Staking Rewards from Collateral

The [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | crypto that is staked]] by borrowers generates [[staking_luna_for_rewards | staking rewards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. These [[staking_luna_for_rewards | staking rewards]] contribute to the overall sustainability of the protocol's high [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | yield]] for lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

For instance, the current [[staking_luna_for_rewards | staking reward]] return can be approximately 5.83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider a scenario where Bob wants to borrow $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. He uses $3,000 in bLuna as [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

*   Alice lends $1,000 and expects to receive around 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   Bob pays a floating [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | interest rate]] for borrowing, for example, 22% on the $1,000 borrowed, which amounts to $220 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The [[staking_luna_for_rewards | staking reward]] generated from Bob's $3,000 [[collateral_management_for_borrowing_on_anchor | collateral]] (at an approximate 5% rate) is $150 ($3,000 * 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In this example, the total amount collected is $370 ($220 from Bob's borrow [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | APR]] + $150 from [[staking_luna_for_rewards | staking rewards]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. From this total, $200 goes to Alice (the lender), and the remaining $170 goes to the [[anchors_dynamic_earn_rates_and_yield_reserve_trends | Anchor yield reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This mechanism helps maintain the high [[interest_rates_and_yields_on_anchor | yield]] for lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This article outlines a [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies | crypto strategy]] for 2022, emphasizing an interest in multichain projects as one of three key investment areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Current Portfolio Strategy

The current [[building_cryptocurrency_portfolios | portfolio]] includes Luna, Ethereum (ETH), and Heroes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The strategy involves continuing to [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | accumulate Luna and ETH]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Instead of selling these assets, the approach is to borrow money against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This method avoids the need for significant fresh funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For instance, USD (UST) can be borrowed using Luna from Anchor Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, and [[stablecoin_investment_options | stablecoin]] can be borrowed by staking ETH in protocols like MakerDAO (likely 'Dai' is implied when saying 'guys') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The borrowed [[stablecoin_investment_options | stablecoin]] can then be used to [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | invest elsewhere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Focus Areas for 2022

Beyond managing the current portfolio, three main areas of interest for 2022 are identified:

1.  **Ethereum Layer 2**: Expected to see significant activity in the first six months, with smart money and centralized exchanges (e.g., Binance adding Arbitrum, OKX adding zkSync) already adopting Layer 2 protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Optimism Arbitrum One and zkSync are of particular interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  **Metaverse Games**: Although metaverse token prices have decreased, games remain crucial for driving crypto adoption, especially those with DeFi elements like DeFi Kingdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The focus is on gaming DAOs, which function like talent agencies, recruiting players, earning from games, and sharing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These DAOs accrue significant treasuries, such as Yield Guild Games (YGG) with $845 million in September data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Mary Chain (likely Merit Circle) is part of the current portfolio, with YGG Sea (a YGG sub-DAO) and Avocado Guild (token yet to launch) on the watchlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
3.  **Multichain Projects**: A key area of interest, with existing holdings in Spell and Time, and plans to accumulate ICE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A separate sub-portfolio was initiated with $1,000, allocated 40% to Time, 30% to Spell, and 30% to ICE, aiming for a 10x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Specific Multichain Projects

*   **Wonderland (TIME)**:
    *   Described as the largest DAO, with $1 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Actively generates income, earning approximately $144,000 daily, totaling about $52 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   Planned expansion to become multichain starting in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Popsicle Finance (ICE)**:
    *   Focuses on yield optimization on Uniswap v3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Uniswap v3 is moving to Polygon, and Popsicle Finance will follow, anticipating a significant influx of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Abracadabra (SPELL)**:
    *   Already multichain, currently on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and soon expanding to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   The platform generates substantial fees, which can be monitored on its dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

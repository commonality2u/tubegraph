Valuation models in [[DeFi | decentralized finance]] are used to assess the financial health and potential of protocols, especially with the emergence of new narratives like [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These models differ significantly from approaches used during earlier "yield farming" days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Evolution from Traditional Yield Farming

Previously, many [[Yield optimization and decentralized finance DeFi | yield farming]] protocols offered extremely high Annual Percentage Yields (APIs), sometimes exceeding 10,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. These "ponzi-like" models often involved buying the platform token, locking it to earn more platform tokens, which users would then quickly sell due to their inflationary nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

In contrast, [[Real Yield in DeFi | Real Yield]] protocols provide rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. When users interact with the protocol, holders receive a share of the generated revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These rewards are typically paid in mainstream assets such as Ethereum (ETH) or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Examples of Real Yield Protocols
*   **GMX**: Staking GMX yields both GMX and ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **GNS**: Staking GNS can earn users 4% in DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Umami**: Depositing Umami tokens can earn ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Kojira**: When staking Kojira (which now operates on its own chain), rewards are collected in various assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Common Valuation Methodologies

Many common valuation models shared on social media platforms like Twitter are based on comparing metrics to assess a protocol's performance in terms of revenues and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Typically, analysts will:
1.  **Calculate Volume and Fees**: Determine the trading volume and the fees generated from that volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
2.  **Estimate P/E Ratio**: From the fees, a ratio can be run to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  **Assess Valuation**: The P/E ratio can then be used to determine if a platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## [[Tools for Building a Valuation Model in DeFi | Tools and Considerations]]

Several [[Tools for Building a Valuation Model in DeFi | tools]] can assist in obtaining the necessary data for DeFi valuation models:
*   **Token Terminal**: A platform that provides financial data for crypto projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Dune Analytics**: Features dashboards built by community members ("giga chats") that offer informative statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Protocol Statistic Pages**: Many protocols host their own dedicated statistics pages with relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

However, when building a valuation model, several factors must be considered:
*   **Supply Figures**: Distinguishing between circulating supply and total supply is crucial, as using one over the other can lead to vastly different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Expenses**: Token emissions, often used to incentivize and attract users, should be treated as expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Chain Migration**: Consider the implications when a protocol moves to a new chain, such as dydx migrating to Cosmos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Factors include the potential loss of Ethereum's security, and changes in wallet and interface requirements, which might affect user retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

There is no single "right or wrong" model; the best approach depends on individual needs and objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

[[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] is presented as a high-risk, high-reward "degen" play with extremely high APYs, similar to how [[market_impact_and_asset_movement_from_snowbank_to_snowdog | Snowbank]] initially began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The project's team is anonymous, raising concerns about potential rug pulls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. It is crucial to understand that the stated APYs are not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Project Phases and Token Mechanics

[[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] differentiates itself from typical [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_typical_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO forks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The team utilizes the [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_typical_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]] method to raise capital for a memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The entire event is designed to last for 8 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Day 1 to Day 5: Minting Phase
During this period, participants can mint any desired amount of S-DOG tokens, which increases the total supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The vesting period for minted tokens is three days, which is shorter than the typical five-day vesting seen in projects like Wonderland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This phase resembles the standard [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_typical_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO]] mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Day 5 to Day 8: Transition and Redemption
After Day 5, minting ceases, but redemptions are still possible for tokens minted on Day 4 that have not yet vested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Day 8: Event Conclusion and Price Volatility
Day 8 is anticipated to be highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. On this day, all collected assets, excluding the liquidity pool, will be swapped for MIM (Magic Internet Money), a stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This MIM will then be used to buy S-DOG from the S-DOG/MIM liquidity pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The S-DOG purchased this way will be burnt, reducing the token supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Staking rewards will also pause, and S-DOG will transition to a fixed supply, becoming a main currency for the project's ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. After Day 8, the token will effectively become a memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Participation Strategies

For those interested in participating, two primary approaches are suggested:

1.  **Minting for Highest Discount**:
    *   Focus on minting from the S-DOG/MIM LP pool, which generally offers the highest discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, if the S-DOG price is 5,400, it might be possible to mint it for 2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   The vesting term is three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Upon vesting, two options become available:
        *   **Claim and Sell**: Claim the tokens and immediately sell them at the current market price if it is favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
        *   **Auto-Stake**: Claim the tokens and auto-stake them to leverage the high APYs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Personal Strategy Example

One participant described their approach of "aping in" to the project to learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Their strategy involved:
*   Apeing into the project for two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Redeeming tokens every few hours and selling them at market price to attempt to recover initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations

[!attention|Caution]
*   **Fast In, Fast Out**: This type of project requires quick action, as it's designed for short-term engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **New and Unique Project**: [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | SnowdogDAO]] is not a typical [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_typical_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO fork]], introducing different dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Anonymous Team**: The developers remain anonymous, which increases the risk of a rug pull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While [[market_impact_and_asset_movement_from_snowbank_to_snowdog | Snowbank]], also from the same team, was functioning well at the time of recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, this does not eliminate future risks.
*   **Degen Play**: The project is considered a "degen" play due to its high risk and experimental nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Limited Lifespan**: The entire event lasts only 8 days, after which the token transitions to a memecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

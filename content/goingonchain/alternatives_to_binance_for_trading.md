Following the [[binance_ban_in_singapore | Binance ban]] in Singapore, users were given one month to withdraw their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Binance announced on September 27, 2021, that users in Singapore would no longer have access to fiat deposits and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This means DBS Remit stopped working for Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Additionally, spot trading and liquid swap services were discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Users were advised to exit all their assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Asset Withdrawal and Service Clarifications

While some users were confused about withdrawing staked assets after October 26, 2021, customer service indicated it might be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. For those concerned, it is recommended to move coins to secure wallets like Trust Wallet or [[alternatives_to_metamask | Metamask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Futures trading, however, was noted as a different service and potentially unaffected by the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These insights largely came from the community group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Finding Alternative Exchanges

To address the need for alternatives, a community poll was conducted to identify commonly used exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The comparison focused on top exchanges due to the large number available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Comparison Criteria

Alternative exchanges were compared based on three key components, using Binance as a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:
1.  **Liquidity**: Important for tighter spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Number of Coins**: Variety of available cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  **Fees**: Trading costs, especially relevant for frequent traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Data for this comparison was sourced from CoinMarketCap (CMC), with fees based on the first tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Recommended Alternatives

*   **For Liquidity**: "4p" (likely referring to Huobi) looks decent, followed by FTX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **For Unknown Coins**: KuCoin ranks highly for offering a wider selection of less common cryptocurrencies, followed by Huobi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **For Traders (Lowest Fees)**: FTX is recommended for its low fees. Holding FTX tokens provides an additional 3% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Example Trading Workflow

One suggested workflow involves using a combination of exchanges:

*   **Gemini**: Utilized for fiat deposits via DBS Remit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Funds are then converted to [[using_stablecoins_and_other_exchanges_for_better_rates | stablecoins]] like UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **KuCoin**: [[using_stablecoins_and_other_exchanges_for_better_rates | Stablecoins]] like UST are sent from Gemini to KuCoin to purchase desired cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Off-Ramp Options**:
    1.  Sell crypto and send funds to [[differences_between_binance_sg_and_binance_global | Binance SG]] to cash out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
    2.  Sell crypto for UST and send the UST to Anchor Protocol to earn yield (e.g., 19.44% APY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Huobi (P)**: Maintained as a standby account for [[transaction_methods_for_buying_and_selling_on_binance_platforms | P2P trading]] with Singapore dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

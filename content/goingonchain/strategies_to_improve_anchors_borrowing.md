The primary goal of the [[borrowing_and_lending_strategies | strategies]] to improve Anchor's borrowing is to make the platform more [[sustainability_of_anchor_platform | sustainable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Need for Improvement

Recently, the yield reserve on Anchor Protocol has been on a downward trend over the past 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is due to a significant imbalance: there are more people depositing funds than there are people [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | borrowing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. To address this disparity and improve the system's balance, Anchor is implementing measures to encourage more borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Key Strategy: Expanding Collateral Options

To bridge the gap between deposits and borrowing, Anchor's main plan is to add more [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] options to the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. By increasing the variety of accepted collateral, more users will be able to [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | borrow]] UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### AVAX as an Example

As a recent example of this strategy, Anchor has added [[avax_collateral_and_borrowing_on_anchor | AVAX]] as a supported collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This allows users holding AVAX to come to Anchor and [[lending_and_borrowing_process_on_anchor_protocol | borrow]] UST against their [[avax_collateral_and_borrowing_on_anchor | AVAX]] holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Implementation Timeline

It's important to note that adding new [[role_of_collateral_in_anchor_protocol | collateral]] types to Anchor is a process that takes time; it's not something that can be done instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The platform's interface is similar to [[comparison_of_finblox_and_hodlnaut|Hodlnaut]], featuring a saving vault and a crypto vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. As of the transcript, Finblox is accessible only via its mobile application, with no web interface available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Interest is paid daily on the Finblox platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unlike [[comparison_of_finblox_and_hodlnaut|Hodlnaut]], Finblox's interest rates do not appear to be tiered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Supported Chains and Transfer Fees

Finblox integrates with multiple blockchain networks, which can lead to lower transfer fees compared to platforms primarily using ERC20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Supported chains include:
*   Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   BNB (Binance Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

For instance, depositing MATIC on Finblox can be done directly via the Polygon network, resulting in cheaper gas fees compared to an ERC20 transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, minting XSGD (SGD Coin) involves ERC20, which users should be aware of regarding associated fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Platform Risk

As of the time of the transcript, Finblox is a relatively new platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The user noted that there was no Know Your Customer (KYC) process upon signing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This contrasts with platforms like [[comparison_of_finblox_and_hodlnaut|Hodlnaut]], which had received in-principle approval, suggesting a level of vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Platform Risk
> The biggest risk identified for Finblox is platform risk, given its relatively new status and lack of formal vetting compared to established platforms like [[comparison_of_finblox_and_hodlnaut|Hodlnaut]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, so do the options and [[types_of_crypto_wallets | security features of crypto wallets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While Metamask was one of the earliest wallets and widely used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, several alternatives offer enhanced [[security_of_crypto_assets | security of crypto assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Brave Wallet

The Brave Wallet is integrated directly into the Brave browser, eliminating the need for additional Chrome extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This built-in design reduces the risk to the browser and potentially enhances [[security_of_crypto_assets | security of crypto assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It connects to various chains, similar to Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Rabby Wallet

Developed by Debank, Rabby Wallet is a Chrome extension that includes a powerful "security" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This feature provides a list of all token approvals a user has granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Key security aspects include:
*   **Token Approval Management** Users can see instances where they have given "infinite" or unlimited access to tokens, such as USDC, to various protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Risk Mitigation** This allows users to understand the potential impact if a project were to be compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, helping to prevent [[hacking_incidents_in_cryptocurrency_wallets | hacking incidents in cryptocurrency wallets]].
*   **Approval Revocation** Unlike Metamask, Rabby enables users to decline or revoke these approvals directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Argent Smart Wallet

Argent is a [[types_of_crypto_wallets | smart wallet]] built on a smart contract, currently supporting Ethereum and Layer 2 ZKsync <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It is particularly highlighted for its [[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | robust security setup]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Significant [[security_measures_in_argent_wallet | security features of Argent wallet]] include:
*   **No Seed Phrase Required** Argent eliminates the need for users to remember a seed phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Alternative Login** Login is managed via email and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Encrypted Seed Phrase Backup** The seed phrase is split and encrypted between Argent's systems and iCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Guardian Feature** Users can designate a trusted individual, such as a spouse, as a "Guardian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If the user's phone is lost, the Guardian can remotely lock the wallet to prevent unauthorized access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

These features demonstrate various [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | strategies for secure crypto asset management]] implemented in modern crypto wallets.

[[bend_dao_platform_features | Bend Dao]] is a lending and borrowing platform specifically designed for NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It has recently gained attention in the NFT market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The platform currently supports seven selected "blue chip" NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Earning Yield by Supplying ETH

Users can supply Ethereum (ETH) to the [[bend_dao_platform_features | Bend Dao]] platform to earn a high Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. At one point, the earnings were reported as 72% in ETH plus an additional platform token, totaling 77% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The utilization rate for supplied ETH is approximately 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Borrowing ETH with NFTs

When borrowing ETH using an NFT as collateral, users currently face a significant "crazy interest" of minus 92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This high borrowing cost is primarily due to an insufficient supply of deposited ETH on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Purchasing NFTs at a Discount (Down Payment)

[[bend_dao_platform_features | Bend Dao]] allows users to acquire NFTs at a discount through a "down payment" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For example, an NFT with a full price of 14.6 ETH might be available for an initial payment of 11.05 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The remaining balance is considered a loan from the platform, which can be repaid at any time along with the accrued interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Bidding on Liquidating NFTs

The platform also facilitates bidding on NFTs that are in the process of liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If an NFT owner, such as for a Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) NFT, borrows 10.82 ETH and the floor price drops to 12.32 ETH, the NFT enters a liquidating state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The owner has 48 hours to redeem their NFT; otherwise, it will be awarded to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Bids must always be greater than the current highest bid price plus one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Challenges and Risks

[[bend_dao_platform_features | Bend Dao]] faces certain challenges:
*   **High Utilization Rate**: The high utilization rate (around 95%) means that those who lend ETH might face difficulties withdrawing their funds when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **ETH Locking for Bidders**: When participating in bids for liquidating NFTs, bidders must lock up their ETH for 48 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This creates a risk for bidders and has led to fewer participants in the bidding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

[[bend_dao_platform_features | Bend Dao]] aims to provide liquidity for NFT holders, but it needs to address these underlying problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

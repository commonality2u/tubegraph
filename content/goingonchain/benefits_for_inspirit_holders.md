SpiritSwap's V2 introduces several benefits and improvements specifically for "in-spirit" holders, acknowledging the increased risk they undertake by locking their tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Enhanced User Interface
The "in-spirit" page in V2 has received significant UI improvements compared to V1, making it much clearer and less cluttered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The updated page provides a clear voting section to track where votes are directed and how to execute them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The dashboard prominently displays the current "in-spirit" balance and locked "spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Claimable Bribes Reward
One of the most notable new features is the ability to claim bribe rewards directly from the "in-spirit" page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Previously, protocols would airdrop bribes, making them difficult and tedious to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. V2 consolidates these rewards, allowing users to claim them conveniently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## AMM Fee Distribution to Voters
The AMM fees have been adjusted from 0.3% to 0.18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This 0.18% fee is distributed as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:
*   **25%** goes to a base fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   **25%** goes to the protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   **50%** constitutes a voting fee, distributed *only* to "in-spirit" holders who vote for gauges attached to specific pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Example Scenario
If an "in-spirit" holder has 10 "in-spirit" directed to a specific pool's gauge (e.g., Lqdr FTM pool), and that gauge receives a total of 100 "in-spirit" votes, the holder possesses a 10% share of that gauge's voting fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. If that pool generates 100,000 in fees the following week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   25,000 will go to all "in-spirit" holders via the base fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   25,000 will go to the protocol (e.g., Liquid Driver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   50,000 will go to the pool's vote fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Given the 10% share, the holder would receive 5,000 worth of Lqdr and FTM tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Real Yield and Protection from Dilution
The new "real yield" model makes participating in "in-spirit" more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. In V2, "in-spirit" holders are protected from dilution caused by "Spirit" emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Example Scenario
If 100,000 "Spirit" are emitted in a week, and 200 million "Spirit" out of a total supply of 500 million "Spirit" are locked as "in-spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>:
*   40,000 "Spirit" would be distributed to "in-spirit" holders that week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

This mechanism ensures "in-spirit" holders receive a subsidized flow of the emission, preventing dilution from farmers and increasing the attractiveness of holding "in-spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

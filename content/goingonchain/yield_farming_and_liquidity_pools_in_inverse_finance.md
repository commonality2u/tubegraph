Inverse Finance has recently undergone an upgrade to its governance token, now called Inverse Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The project aims to add value to its governance token, unlike many others that solely focus on voting or do not accrue value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Inverse Plus is designed as a "positive sum rewards token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Inverse Finance offers three core products:
*   **IMV Token**: A token for buying and staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Anchor**: A platform for lending and borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **DOLA**: Their native stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## DOLA Stablecoin and Yield Opportunities

The DOLA stablecoin offers [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | farming opportunities]] on both Ethereum (Eve) and Phantom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Liquidity Pools for DOLA

For swapping DOLA, users can utilize either Curve or Stabilizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

*   **Stabilizer**: This is Inverse Finance's own [[impact_of_liquidity_pools_on_stablecoins | liquidity pool]], consisting of a DOLA/DAI pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It features a swap fee of approximately 0.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> and guarantees a fixed rate of 0.996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The pool has about 4 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Anchor: Lending and Borrowing Platform

Anchor is the core platform for lending and borrowing activities within Inverse Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The total value locked (TVL) on Anchor is around 65 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Users can deposit assets to earn a base reward and a rewards APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, depositing ETH yields a base reward of 0.08% APY and an IMV token reward at a 5.34% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## IMV Token: Staking and Utility

The IMV token stands out with a 122% APY when supplied to Anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This high yield is because supplying IMV to Anchor also involves staking it simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

When IMV is deposited into Inverse Finance, users receive xIMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, which provides several benefits:

*   **IMV Emission**: xIMV holders receive IMV emissions, distributed approximately 6400 times a day per ETH block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The APY for staking IMV to get xIMV is capped at 500% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This cap can only be changed through a new governance vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. There is no maximum supply for the IMV token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, but the DAO can introduce a cap and cease minting if emissions become too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

*   **Protocol Revenue Share**: IMV stakers receive a portion of the protocol's revenue, which is generated from borrowing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Voting Rights**: xIMV grants voting rights on the Inverse Finance governance page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The governance process is active, with 35 proposals made and 32 passed, including the recent Inverse Plus upgrade, all through on-chain voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Collateral for Borrowing Stablecoins**: A unique feature is the ability to use xIMV as collateral to borrow DOLA stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This means users can buy IMV, supply it, earn IMV emission at 122% APY, earn protocol revenue, participate in governance, and then use their staked IMV as collateral to borrow stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For example, if $100 worth of IMV is staked and $30 of DOLA is borrowed, the $100 of IMV continues to earn the 122% APY, assuming it hasn't been degraded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This highlights capital efficiency, as funds are not locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This mechanism enables a form of [[stablecoin_leveraged_yield_farming | leveraged yield farming]].

## Transparency

Inverse Finance features a transparency tab on its platform, which is unusual for a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This tab provides smart contract links and details on how these contracts interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, offering insights similar to reading a company's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

For more information, interested individuals can find Inverse Plus details on their Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The Arbitrum Odyssey is an eight-week campaign designed to encourage users to try out Arbitrum, offering NFTs in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. A key component of this campaign is "bridging week," which requires users to move ETH to Arbitrum using a selected list of bridges to qualify for an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. There is no minimum sum required to bridge, and users can utilize multiple bridges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The asset that counts for the bridge event is ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

The campaign concludes on June 27th at 13:00 Eastern Time, or June 28th at 01:00 Singapore Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

## Potential Airdrops and Bonus NFTs

A significant aspect of the Arbitrum Odyssey is the [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | speculation]] that participating projects without existing tokens might offer airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. By trying out these projects, users may qualify for future airdrops from their respective protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Additionally, using the bridge with the most wallet activations during the bridging week can earn participants an extra bonus NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. As of the recording, Hop Protocol and Celer Network were noted as leading in wallet activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Bridges Without Tokens

The strategy of using bridges that do not yet have their own tokens is based on the [[speculation_on_bridge_tokens_and_potential_airdrops | speculation]] that such bridges might conduct airdrops for early users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This approach aims to potentially qualify for both the Arbitrum Odyssey NFT and a bridge-specific airdrop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

Some protocols that do not currently have tokens, but are part of the selected list for the Arbitrum Odyssey, include Lifi, Bungee, and Hashflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Additional Incentives from Bridges

Several bridges participating in the Arbitrum Odyssey are offering their own incentives for users:

### Lifi
Lifi has announced that they will be rewarding users who bridge with them, though specific details regarding the rewards were not yet public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Hashflow
Hashflow is providing a limited edition NFT that winners can redeem for Hashflow tokens upon launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Participants can swap any asset from any chain to ETH on Arbitrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
The winning criteria for Hashflow's incentive are:
*   100 participants with the highest total volume bridged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>
*   100 randomly selected lucky participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>

### Bungee
To qualify for additional incentives from Bungee, users need to be among the top 1,000 addresses with the highest token value bridged in a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Bungee operates as an aggregator, aiming to provide the highest return or lowest gas fee for bridging transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Hop
Hop Protocol is offering a special gift to 10 lucky "hoppers" in the form of a small brand NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Bridging

When [[bridging_process_and_options_for_arbitrum | bridging]], it's crucial to consider not just [[importance_of_gas_fees_and_slippage_in_bridging | gas fees]], but also slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Some bridges may have higher slippage, impacting the final amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. For example, a 0.1 ETH bridge transaction might result in 0.0972 ETH after slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

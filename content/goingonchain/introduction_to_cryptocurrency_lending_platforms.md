Cryptocurrency lending platforms function similarly to peer-to-peer (P2P) lending services, such as Funding Society or MoolahSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These platforms allow users to either lend out their digital assets or borrow against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## How Crypto Lending Platforms Work

*   **As a Lender**: You can lend your cryptocurrency to the platform and, in return, earn interest on your deposited funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **As a Borrower**: You can deposit crypto as collateral to obtain a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Once the loan, along with its interest, is repaid, your deposited crypto is returned to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Featured Platforms

Three prominent platforms often discussed in the crypto lending space are BlockFi, Celsius Network, and Holdnaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Risk Considerations

As with any investment, there are risks involved. If a platform were to experience significant issues, users could potentially lose their deposited funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## When to Consider Crypto Lending

If you hold cryptocurrencies, lending them out could be a way to earn passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Even if you don't own crypto, you might consider buying [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | stablecoins]] like USDT or USDC, which are cryptocurrencies backed by the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The interest rates offered by these platforms are significantly more attractive than those typically offered by traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

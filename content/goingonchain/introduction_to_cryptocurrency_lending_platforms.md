Cryptocurrency lending platforms are online services that facilitate the lending and borrowing of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. They can be thought of as similar to [[peer_to_peer_lending_and_borrowing | P2P lending]] platforms like Funding Societies or MoolahSense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## How They Work

These platforms support two main roles:

*   **Lender**: As a lender, you deposit [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] assets onto the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In return, you earn funds and [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest]] on your lent assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Borrower**: As a borrower, you can deposit [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] as collateral to receive a [[borrowing_against_crypto_assets | loan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Once the [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest]] and principal are paid back, your deposited [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] is returned to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Featured Platforms

Several platforms offer [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] lending services. Three notable examples include:

### BlockFi
BlockFi is a well-known platform regulated in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Interest Payouts**: [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | Interest]] is paid out monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: There is no lock-in period and no minimum deposit sum required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **[[features_and_fees_of_crypto_lending_platforms | Withdrawal Fees]]**: They offer one free [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] withdrawal and one free stablecoin withdrawal per calendar month; additional withdrawals incur a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Example Earnings**: Lending 10,000 USDC (a stablecoin tied to the US Dollar) could earn approximately 860 in [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest]] in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This rate is significantly higher than what traditional banks might offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Celsius Network
Celsius Network is based in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Coin Selection**: It offers a wider selection of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | coins]] for lending and borrowing compared to BlockFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates**: Rates are generally more attractive than BlockFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: There is no lock-in, no minimum sum, and no [[features_and_fees_of_crypto_lending_platforms | withdrawal fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Payouts**: [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | Interest]] is paid out weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Promotions**: They offer a bonus of 50 worth of Bitcoin (BTC) for new sign-ups who transfer 400 or more into the platform and hold it for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Hodlnaut
Hodlnaut has headquarters in Singapore and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Interest Payouts**: [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | Interest]] is paid out weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: There is no lock-in period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Interest Rates**: Hodlnaut offers some of the highest [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest]] rates among the three platforms, reaching up to 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Key Comparisons
All three platforms generally have no deposit fees, no lock-in periods, and no minimum investment amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Celsius Network stands out with no [[features_and_fees_of_crypto_lending_platforms | withdrawal fees]] and a broader selection of [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | coins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Hodlnaut typically offers the highest rates for stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Important Considerations
*   **[[considerations_and_risks_in_using_crypto_lending_platforms | Risks]]**: It is crucial to consider the [[considerations_and_risks_in_using_crypto_lending_platforms | risks]] involved, as platforms can fail, leading to potential loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Stablecoins**: For those without existing [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | crypto]] assets, purchasing stablecoins like USDT or USDC is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Stablecoins are [[introduction_to_cryptocurrency | cryptocurrencies]] backed by the US Dollar, effectively acting like digital US dollars, but they offer significantly higher [[interest_rates_and_potential_earnings_from_crypto_lending | interest]] rates compared to traditional bank offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

*Note: All rates mentioned are correct as of June 20, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.*

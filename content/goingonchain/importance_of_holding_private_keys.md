The principle of "not your keys, not your coins" is a crucial lesson in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This adage emphasizes that if an individual does not personally control the [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | private keys]] to their cryptocurrency, they do not truly own or secure their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

This point was underscored by the speaker's experience with the Grim Finance hack, which resulted in the loss of their entire position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The funds were placed into position on a Saturday night, and the hack occurred Sunday morning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The incident highlighted the pain and consequences of not having direct control over one's digital assets when a protocol is compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

While controlling one's own keys is paramount for [[security_of_crypto_assets | asset security]], for those engaging in DeFi with substantial positions, purchasing insurance is also recommended as a mitigating [[strategies_for_secure_crypto_asset_management | security measure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Although insurance did not cover Grim Finance, services like Insure provide coverage for other protocols within ecosystems like Fantom, such as Abracadabra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. If a covered protocol is hacked, policyholders can claim their money back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The speaker personally uses Anchor Protocol insurance, though it quickly runs out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Takeaway
> The fundamental lesson learned from experiencing a hack is that not holding your [[security_features_of_crypto_wallets | private keys]] means you do not truly own your coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

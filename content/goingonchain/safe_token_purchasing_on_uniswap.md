When acquiring tokens on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, it's crucial to employ safe practices to avoid interacting with scam tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. While many tokens can be found on Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, if a specific token isn't available, an alternative platform like [[transaction_methods_for_buying_and_selling_on_binance_platforms | SushiSwap]] can be explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:01">[02:02:01]</a>.

## Recommended Safe Purchasing Method

To ensure you are purchasing the correct token and to mitigate the risk of encountering scam tokens, follow these steps:

> [!warning] Do not directly paste token names into Uniswap
> Pasting the name of a token directly into [[direct_integration_with_uniswap_backend_for_advanced_users | Uniswap]] is not recommended, as there could be scam tokens using similar names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:22">[02:02:22]</a>. For example, if searching for "life peer," you cannot be certain it is the correct token without further verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:30">[02:02:30]</a>.

The safer way to purchase tokens is to use their verified contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:32">[02:02:32]</a>:

1.  **View on Explorer**
    Navigate to a reliable blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan) for the specific token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:34">[02:02:34]</a>.
2.  **Copy Contract Address**
    From the explorer, copy the token's official contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:36">[02:02:36]</a>.
3.  **Paste into Uniswap**
    Return to [[direct_integration_with_uniswap_backend_for_advanced_users | Uniswap]] and paste the copied contract address into the token selection field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:38">[02:02:38]</a>.
4.  **Select and Purchase**
    This method ensures you are selecting the correct token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:41">[02:02:41]</a>. You can then proceed to purchase the desired amount, such as 0.001 units of the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>.

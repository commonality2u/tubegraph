The GNS token plays a crucial role in providing [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity]] for the Gains Network's leveraged trading platform, Gains Trade, which operates on the Polygon chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## GNS Token's Role in Liquidity

Gains Trade utilizes a synthetic exchange model for leveraged trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, meaning there is no real spot asset being bought or sold during a trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. The platform is supported by two primary pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>:
*   The GNS DAI pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>
*   The trading pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>

When a user initiates a trade, they deposit DAI into the trading pool, and their profits or losses are settled from this same pool upon exiting the trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

The GNS DAI pool's function is to maintain the trading pool's capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The trading pool is ideally maintained at 110% capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>:
*   **If the trading pool exceeds 110% capitalization**, the excess DAI is used to buy GNS from the GNS DAI pool, and this GNS is then burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **If the trading pool falls below 100% capitalization**, new GNS tokens are minted and sold for DAI to replenish the trading pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

This mechanism creates a buying pressure on the GNS token, particularly if there are more traders losing than winning, which helps make the GNS token deflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Statistics have shown that, since the project's inception, more traders have lost than won, contributing to this deflationary pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## GNS Tokenomics and Statistics

The [[Gains Network overview and platform features | Gains Network]] platform launched in January 2021 on the Ethereum mainnet but transitioned to the Polygon chain due to high gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. During this transition, a 1:1000 split of the gPhantom token (old token) to GNS was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

*   **Total Supply**: Currently, the total supply of GNS is 38.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Maximum Supply**: The maximum potential supply is 100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Deflationary Design**: GNS is designed to be deflationary, with more tokens being burned as traders lose on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

The platform's revenue, primarily from fees, has seen significant growth, indicating a potential product-market fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This includes increasing fees earned, growing trade volume (5 billion accumulated), and a rising number of users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## Staking GNS

Users can contribute [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity]] to the GNS DAI pool and the trading pool by staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   The trading pool offers a 10% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   The [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity]] pool offers a 47% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

The GNS token's inflation rate is currently deflationary at -25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. The platform also features [[nft_features_and_defi_use_cases_on_gains_network | NFT]]s that can boost [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity]] pool rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

Using its own GNS token to provide [[providing_liquidity_through_platforms | liquidity]] helps the platform onboard more assets and reinforce its deflationary nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

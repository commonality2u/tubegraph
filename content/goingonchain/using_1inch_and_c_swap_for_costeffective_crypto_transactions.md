Recently, [[Uniswap swap fees | Uniswap]] implemented a 0.15% swap fee for using their user interface (UI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This fee applies when you use the site to make a swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While it may seem small, it accumulates with multiple transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These fees are directed to Uniswap Labs, not to UNI token holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. To avoid these fees, consider using aggregators like 1inch and C Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Utilizing 1inch for Swaps

1inch is an aggregator that can help you achieve better rates and lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### How 1inch Works
When you place an order with 1inch, it enters an order pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. 1inch resolvers compete to fulfill your order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. If a resolver takes your order, they cover the gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This mechanism allows users to pay less in fees and receive better rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Cost Comparison Example
For instance, selling 1 ETH for USDT on 1inch can yield 1574 USDT, with a free network fee and a $2.24 settlement fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. In contrast, performing the same swap on [[Uniswap swap fees | Uniswap]] would result in 1569 USDT, along with a $2.36 Uniswap fee and a $5 network cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Leveraging C Swap for Transactions

C Swap is another platform that enables competitive rates and lower fees for cryptocurrency transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### How C Swap Works
C Swap can be understood as processing "batch orders" or "intents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. When a request is placed, C Swap collects all orders (intents) and organizes them into an order book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Solvers then work to find matches between buyers and sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. For example, if you want to sell ETH and another user wants to buy ETH, C Swap will match you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This matching process is what allows for competitive rates and lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Cost Comparison Example
Selling 1 ETH on C Swap can yield 1574 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This compares favorably to selling 1 ETH on [[Uniswap swap fees | Uniswap]], which would yield 1570 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

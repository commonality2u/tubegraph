Tangible is a marketplace that specializes in [[converting_real_world_assets_into_nfts | converting real world assets into NFTs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This platform allows for the purchase of tangible items such as gold bars, watches, and even real estate using USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## How Tangible Works for High-Value Assets

When a purchase is made on Tangible, an NFT (specifically a tNFT) is minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The corresponding physical item is then stored in a secure vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Storage Fees:** Because items are held in a vault, a storage fee is incurred, especially for high-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Delivery Option:** Buyers retain the option to take physical delivery of their purchased item at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Platform Fees

For items acquired from another seller on the platform, a 2.5% platform fee is charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This fee is distributed as follows:

*   **33%** is used to buy and burn Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **66.66%** goes to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Tokenization of Real Estate

Tangible also facilitates the tokenization of real estate, allowing users to purchase a fraction of a property or acquire all fractions to own the entire asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

*   **Yield Generation:** The focus for real estate NFTs is on capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For example, a property might generate a net yield of approximately 15.17%, including both capital appreciation and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Fees and Management:** It's important to account for management and other fees, as Tangible handles the legal work, maintenance, and paperwork for these properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Yield Activation:** Yield generation only begins once all property fractions have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## USDR Stablecoin

Tangible backs a stablecoin called USDR, which is over-collateralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. USDR is collateralized by a mix of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, DAI, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

*   **Stability Measures:** To prevent a "death spiral" scenario, drawing lessons from the UST incident, Tangible ensures that at least 88% of USDR's backing comes from assets other than its native token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Yield Offering:** Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25%, with plans to subsidize and increase it to 6-9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Tangible Tokens

Tangible tokens have several [[utility_and_use_cases_of_nft_tokens | utilities]] within the ecosystem:

*   **Minting USDR:** They can be used for minting the USDR stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Revenue Share:** Tangible tokens receive revenue from product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Staking and Locking:** Users can stake and lock Tangible tokens, converting them into an NFT. Longer lock-up periods lead to higher rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. If a user wishes to exit, they can sell their NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

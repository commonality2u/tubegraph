Hundred Finance, a multichain lending and borrowing protocol, recently completed its first mirroring event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This development allows users to mirror their locked veHND, referred to as mveHND, from one chain to another, such as from Fantom (FTM) to Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Hundred Finance is available on eight different chains, with Polygon being the latest addition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Earning HND Tokens and Yield

On Hundred Finance, users can stake assets to [[earning_yield_on_locked_vehnd_tokens | earn yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, staking $500 could yield 26% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Assets can also be supplied as collateral for borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> or used for backstop provision, which involves supplying assets for liquidation and also [[earning_yield_on_locked_vehnd_tokens | earns yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The yield earned on Hundred Finance is paid in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Locking HND for mveHND

Users can take their earned HND tokens, [[locking_hnd_for_additional_benefits | lock them up]], and convert them into mveHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This locked mveHND is crucial for enhancing rewards on the platform.

## Using mveHND for Voting and Boosting APR

Once a user holds mveHND, they can use it to [[voting_dynamics_in_defi_protocols | vote]] for specific pools to [[using_vehnd_for_boosting_rewards | boost their Annual Percentage Rate (APR)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To achieve the maximum boost, such as an 86% APR on FRAX, sufficient HND tokens must be locked to reach a 2.5x max boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For instance, locking 300 HND for four years can provide a 1.5x boost, while increasing it to 1000 HND can provide the maximum 2.5x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### The Mirroring Feature

A significant development is the ability to [[benefits_of_mirroring_vehnd_across_chains | mirror locked mveHND tokens]] from one chain to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This is particularly beneficial for users active on multiple chains, like someone using Hundred Finance on both Fantom and Polygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Without mirroring, users would need to perform separate lockups on each chain, effectively "double locking" assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. With mirroring, the mveHND can be easily transferred and then used to [[voting_dynamics_in_defi_protocols | vote]] and [[using_vehnd_for_boosting_rewards | boost APR]] on the target chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. An example showed a 1.07x boost on the USDC pool on Polygon after mirroring mveHND <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Hundred Finance utilizes LayerZero services for this mirroring functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Currently, mveHND mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon, though not all directional transfers are fully ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Mirroring from Fantom to Polygon is confirmed to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### How to Mirror veHND

From the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom), users can find the "Mirror" option, choose the desired destination chain, click "Mirror," and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

This mirroring capability significantly enhances the incentive to use Hundred Finance across various chains, as users can immediately leverage their existing locked mveHND to [[earning_yield_on_locked_vehnd_tokens | earn more yield]] by [[using_vehnd_for_boosting_rewards | boosting APR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

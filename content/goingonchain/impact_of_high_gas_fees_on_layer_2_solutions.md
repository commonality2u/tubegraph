From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

The Arbitrum Odyssey campaign, in its second week, was paused due to a significant surge in gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This rise in fees meant that a single swap could cost approximately $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Challenges for [[layer_2_solutions_and_arbitrums_role | Layer 2 Solutions]]
This situation presented a particular challenge for [[layer_2_solutions_and_arbitrums_role | Layer 2 solutions]], as they are specifically designed to offer cheaper transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The unexpectedly high [[understanding_cryptocurrency_transaction_fees | swap fee]] contradicted the core benefit of using an L2 platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Arbitrum Nitro Update
To address the heavy load on the chain and subsequently reduce gas fees, the Arbitrum Odyssey campaign will resume after the launch of "Nitro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Nitro is described as an accelerated version of Arbitrum, aimed at reducing the burden on the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

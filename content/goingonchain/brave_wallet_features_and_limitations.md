The Brave wallet is presented as an alternative to [[metamask_security_features | Metamask]], which is commonly used in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. As the crypto landscape evolves, more wallet options like Brave have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Key Features

The Brave wallet offers several distinct advantages:
*   **Built-in Functionality** It is built directly into the Brave browser, eliminating the need to download extra Chrome extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This integration can lead to less risk for the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **User Interface (UI)** The wallet boasts a "super good" user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Multi-chain Connectivity** Similar to [[metamask_security_features | Metamask]], Brave wallet can connect to various blockchain networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Page** It includes a portfolio page that retrieves coin prices from CoinGecko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Limitations

Despite its features, the Brave wallet has some weaknesses:
*   **Coin Tracker Issues** The coin tracker within the wallet is not considered very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **LP Token Tracking** It is unable to automatically track LP (liquidity pool) tokens, requiring users to add them manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Token Recognition** The wallet may not automatically recognize or display new or certain tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. For instance, the 'cre8r' token had to be manually added, even though it would automatically appear in [[metamask_security_features | Metamask]] upon purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

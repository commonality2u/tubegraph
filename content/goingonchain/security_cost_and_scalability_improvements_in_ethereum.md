The upcoming [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge on Ethereum]] is a significant event that will transition [[Ethereums transition from POW to POS | Ethereum from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. While many narratives exist, some misconceptions need clarifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The change specifically targets the consensus layer of the blockchain, moving from [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Proof of Work]] to [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Proof of Stake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Why the Merge?

The [[ethereum_merge_and_its_implications | Ethereum merge]] is being implemented for several key reasons, primarily focusing on reducing security costs and enhancing scalability for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Lower Security Cost

One of the primary drivers for the merge is to reduce the overall security cost of the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

*   **Current PoW Limitations**
    Setting up an [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Ethereum]] mining rig under [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Proof of Work]] is expensive due to hardware costs and consumes a significant amount of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **PoS Accessibility**
    By transitioning to [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Proof of Stake]], the security cost is lowered, making it more accessible for a greater number of people to participate as validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This means less energy and less cost are needed to achieve network consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **Participation Options**
    Individuals can become validators more easily, even using a Raspberry Pi, provided they have 32 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. For those without 32 ETH, participation is still possible through pooling options like Lido or Rocket Pool, which combine smaller ETH amounts for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Operating Costs**
    This shift leads to a significant reduction in network operating costs, estimated at 99.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This reduction stems from decreased energy consumption and hardware expenses, as mining rigs are no longer required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### Scalability for the Future

Another critical reason for the merge is to lay the groundwork for future scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

*   **Sharding (EIP 484)**
    Plans are in place for sharding, often referred to as EIP 484 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Sharding aims to improve transaction throughput by dividing the network into smaller, more manageable segments.
*   **Statelessness**
    The network also has plans for statelessness, which would further enhance its efficiency and scalability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **PoS vs. PoW for Extension**
    Extending the capabilities of the blockchain is significantly easier under [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Proof of Stake]] compared to [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | Proof of Work]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. The architectural design of [[proof_of_work_vs_proof_of_stake_in_ethereum | PoS]] allows for more flexible and extensive future development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Vitalik Buterin's detailed flowcharts demonstrate the extensive planning for [[ethereum_layer_2_protocols | Ethereum's]] future capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Gas Fees and the Merge
> Despite common belief, the [[the_merge_on_ethereum | Merge]] will *not* directly [[impact_of_ethereum_merge_on_gas_fees | lower gas fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Gas fees are paid on the execution layer of the blockchain, while the merge primarily changes the consensus layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Gas fees are influenced by supply and demand for block space and the complexity of decentralized applications (dApps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

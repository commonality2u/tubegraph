Following the announcement of service restrictions by Binance, users in Singapore were given one month to withdraw assets by October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Binance Restrictions in Singapore

Binance announced on September 27, 2021, that users in Singapore would no longer have services for fiat deposits and withdrawals, meaning DBS Remit would cease to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Additionally, spot trading and liquid swaps were no longer available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Concerns arose regarding existing assets:
*   **Staking**: It was unclear if users could still withdraw staked tokens (e.g., CAKE) after October 26, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. While customer service (CS) indicated yes, the recommendation for concerned users was to transfer coins to a personal wallet like Trust Wallet or MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Futures Trading**: According to CS, futures trading was considered a different service and was not affected by the restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. These insights were gathered from community discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

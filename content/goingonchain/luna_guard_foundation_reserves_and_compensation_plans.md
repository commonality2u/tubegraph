The Luna Guard Foundation (LFG) initially held a substantial amount of Bitcoin (BTC) reserves, which they liquidated in an attempt to support [[UST mechanism and its impact on LUNA | UST]] during its depeg event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Remaining Reserves
LFG has since disclosed the remaining assets in their reserve, which total approximately $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Compensation Plan
The remaining assets are designated to compensate current [[UST mechanism and its impact on LUNA | UST]] holders, with a focus on prioritizing the smallest holders first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Criticisms and Alternative Approaches
Questions have been raised regarding LFG's handling of its BTC reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A point of contention is whether the BTC could have been used directly to compensate [[UST mechanism and its impact on LUNA | UST]] holders instead of being sold to support [[UST mechanism and its impact on LUNA | UST]] in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Some argue that selling the BTC on the market may have inadvertently created an opportunity for large holders ("whales") to exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

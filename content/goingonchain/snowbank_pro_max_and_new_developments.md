Despite the anonymous nature of its development team, Snowbank is introducing several new features and initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

## Snowbank Pro Max

Snowbank is set to introduce "Snowbank Pro Max" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This initiative is described as being similar to Olympus DAO Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Its primary function will be to assist other projects in owning liquidity, with Snowbank earning a small fee from these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Airdrop for Supporters

An airdrop is planned for [[staking_on_snowbank | stakers]] and minters who supported Snowbank during its "most painful period," when the price dropped to a low of $1600 before slowly climbing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Snow (Main Coin of Avalanche)

Snowbank has also released something called "Snow," which they aim to make the main coin of [[advantages_of_avalanche_platform | Avalanche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. The developer notes excitement about what will happen to [[market_volatility_and_strategies_for_investing_in_snowdogdao | Snowdog]] given the current growth of [[advantages_of_avalanche_platform | Avalanche]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Snowdog's Concept
[[market_volatility_and_strategies_for_investing_in_snowdogdao | Snowdog]] features an interesting concept:
*   The first five days utilize a rebase token method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   Following this period, a giant buyback for the coin is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

The Nexus Protocol offers an arbitrage opportunity on Terra through its Liquid Pylon Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This pool involves a 24-month lock-up period for deposited UST (TerraUSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Pool Mechanics and Rewards

When UST is deposited into the Liquid Pylon Pool, it behaves similarly to a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. After 24 months, the initial deposited amount of UST is returned along with accumulated rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The primary reward for liquidity providers in this pool is the Nexus token, which currently offers an APR (Annual Percentage Rate) of about 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Distinction from Regular Pylon Pool

The key difference between the Liquid Pylon Pool and a regular Pylon Pool lies in the issuance of a unique receipt token called bPsiDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This token acts as proof of deposit and allows for early exit from the 24-month lock-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Users can sell their bPsiDP on platforms like Terashot to convert it back to UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Current Arbitrage Opportunity (De-peg)

Presently, there is a "de-peg" opportunity where the bPsiDP token can be acquired at a significant discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For example, $100 of UST could be used to purchase bPsiDP equivalent to $128.973 of deposited UST on Pylon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This represents a de-peg of approximately 28-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This discrepancy might be due to bearish market conditions causing people to sell off their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Taking Advantage of the De-peg

To capitalize on this arbitrage opportunity, one must be bullish on the [[investment_strategy_and_risks_with_nexus_token | Nexus token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The strategy involves:

1.  **Buying bPsiDP at a discount:** Acquire bPsiDP for less than its inherent value in UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Waiting for the de-peg to resolve:**
    *   If the de-peg resolves (bPsiDP's value returns closer to its pegged UST value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   In the worst-case scenario, if the de-peg does not resolve sooner, one would wait the full 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. After 24 months, the original deposited UST amount (corresponding to the bPsiDP's full value) will be returned, plus the accrued Nexus token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> While waiting for the de-peg to resolve or for the 24-month period to conclude, the investor earns Nexus token rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, 24 months is considered a very long duration in the volatile crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Grow Protocol is a DeFi yield optimizer designed to balance [[risk_management_in_stablecoin_farming | risk]] and offer leverage on [[stablecoin_investment_options | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It has been operating on the mainnet with two primary products:

*   **Powered** - Functions like a fixed deposit where users put in [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | stablecoins]] to receive better returns than traditional finance, along with deposit protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Vault** - Offers leveraged [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield]] on stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

These two products are interdependent; increased deposits in Powered savings lead to higher returns for the Vault, as the Vault leverages assets from Powered. Any protocol losses are first covered by the Vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Grow Protocol's Labs on Avalanche

The Grow Protocol team has extended its expertise to Avalanche, introducing two active "Labs": the USDC leveraged [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield]] and the USDT leveraged [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### How the Labs Work

The Labs leverage farms from Alpha Homora V2, which is a leveraged [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield farming]] platform on Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Funds from the Lab are used as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  AVAX is borrowed using this collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Stablecoins are leveraged at 2x to open new positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The Labs automatically execute strategies based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Each time a position is opened and closed, it's considered a "strategy cycle." This process is automated, with [[evaluating_and_managing_yield_farming_risks | risks]] continuously rebalanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

While some strategy cycles may have negative returns, the average return is approximately 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The Lab's user interface clearly displays the Total Value Locked (TVL), the reserve (funds not yet deployed), and the AVAX exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Comparison to Other Stablecoin Farms

When comparing Grow Protocol's Labs to other [[stablecoin_investment_options | stablecoin]] farms, such as a USDT farm on Trader Joe offering a 17.8% APR, a key distinction is the form of reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While other platforms might provide rewards broken down into pool APR and native protocol tokens (e.g., JOE APR), Grow Protocol's USDT Lab yields around 17% APY in pure stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This means users earn stablecoin directly, without needing to sell protocol tokens to convert them back to stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## How to Use Grow Labs

To use Grow Labs:
1.  Connect your wallet, ensuring it is on the Avalanche network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  Choose the desired Lab, either USDC or USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  Users can deposit or withdraw stablecoins at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
4.  The maximum deposit limit is 5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. To increase this allowance, users need to own at least 500 GROW, which is the governance token available on Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Performance During Market Volatility

The Grow Protocol team conducted a test of their automated Lab strategy during a period of high volatility. On December 3rd, 2021, they deployed 5,000 USD into a Lab. Between December 3rd and December 6th, AVAX dropped by approximately 20%, from $104 to $83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Despite this significant drop, the Lab strategy was able to yield a 0.5% gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. During this period, the Lab opened and closed positions 13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Important Considerations

While [[yield_farming_and_growing_your_crypto | yield]] optimization protocols can be an interesting option during market volatility, it is important to note that these are not [[evaluating_and_managing_yield_farming_risks | risk-free]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is a rapidly evolving space, and conditions can change quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Users are advised to conduct their own research and make their own investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Grow Protocol is a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield optimizer designed to balance risk and offer leverage on [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It has been operating on the mainnet, providing two primary products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>:

*   **Powered** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>: Functions similarly to a fixed deposit, allowing users to deposit [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] for better returns than traditional finance, with deposit protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Vault** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>: Offers leveraged [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield]] on [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The two products are interconnected; increased deposits in Powered saving lead to higher returns for the Vault, as the Vault leverages assets from Powered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Any protocol losses are first covered by the Vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Grow Protocol's Lab on Avalanche

Grow Protocol has extended its expertise to Avalanche, introducing two active "Labs": the USDC leveraged [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield]] and the USDT leveraged [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### How the Lab Works

The Lab leverages farms from Alpha Homora v2, which is a leveraged [[yield_farming_to_grow_cryptocurrency | yield farming]] platform on Avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
The process involves:
1.  Using funds from the Lab as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  Borrowing AVAX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
3.  Leveraging [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoins]] at 2x to open new positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
4.  Executing strategies based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
5.  Automating the opening and closing of positions, known as strategy cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
6.  Continuously rebalancing risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

While individual strategy cycles may sometimes yield negative returns, the average return is approximately 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The Lab's user interface displays the total value locked (TVL), reserves (funds not deployed), and AVAX exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### [[comparison_of_yield_farming_on_stablecoin_platforms | Comparison to Other Stablecoin Farms]]

When comparing Grow Protocol's Lab to other [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoin]] farms, such as the USDT farm on Trader Joe (which offers a total APR of 17.8% broken down into pool APR and JOE APR), the Grow Protocol USDT Lab also yields around 17% APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A key difference is that the Grow Lab earns [[real_yield_in_defi | pure stablecoin]], eliminating the need to sell protocol tokens to convert them back to [[using_stablecoins_in_yield_farming | stablecoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### How to Use the Lab

To use the Lab:
1.  Connect your wallet, ensuring it's on the Avalanche network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  Choose either the USDC or USDT Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  Users can deposit and withdraw at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
4.  The maximum deposit limit is 5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. To increase this allowance, users must own at least 500 GROW, the governance token available on Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Performance During Market Volatility

A test conducted by the Grow team on their automated Lab strategy demonstrated its resilience during market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. From December 3rd to December 6th, AVAX dropped by approximately 20% (from $104 to $83) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Despite this significant drop, a $5,000 deposit in the Lab strategy yielded a 0.5% gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. During this period, the Lab opened and closed positions 13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Considerations

In times of market volatility, [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | yield optimization protocols]] like Grow Protocol can be an interesting consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, it is crucial to note that these strategies are not risk-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Given the rapidly evolving nature of [[yield_optimization_and_decentralized_finance_defi | DeFi]], it is essential to conduct your own research before making investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

[[staking_luna_for_rewards | Staking LUNA]] allows users to earn more LUNA and receive airdrops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This process is conducted directly within the Terra Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Staking LUNA via Terra Wallet

To begin [[staking_luna_for_rewards | staking LUNA]], navigate to your Terra Wallet and click on the "staking" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Validator Selection

Upon entering the staking section, you will find a list of 105 validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This list is initially sorted by uptime, but can be reordered by commission or voting power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

When [[choosing_validators_for_luna_staking | choosing validators]], consider the following criteria:

*   **Avoid Top Validators**
    It is generally not recommended to stake with the top 5 validators to prevent power concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Self-Delegation**
    This metric indicates the amount a validator has staked themselves, demonstrating their "skin in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher self-delegation amount is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Commission**
    Commission is the percentage of your rewards taken by the validator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Validators with a 0% commission are desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Uptime**
    Validators should ideally have 100% uptime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. If a validator is not operational, you will not earn rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The speaker mentioned staking with a validator with 6% voting power, possibly named "Orion," due to interest in their airdrops, and noted that partial staking with different validators is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Delegating LUNA

Once you have selected a validator, click "delegate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Input the desired amount of LUNA to stake, then proceed by clicking "next" and "go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. After delegation, you can view a summary of your delegated amount and the rewards you are earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

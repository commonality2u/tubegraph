A specific type of cryptocurrency scam involves promising users the ability to perform [[mev_extraction_strategies_like_gas_sniffing_and_front_running | front-running]] transactions on platforms like PancakeSwap to generate profit, typically in BNB (Binance Coin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Scam Mechanism

The scam is often advertised via YouTube channels that provide a script, claiming that by following it, users can create a bot capable of front-running transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The promise is a significant return, such as at least 10 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Once a user tests the bot with an initial amount of BNB, the bot predictably fails to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The scammer then provides a "lame excuse," such as claiming that the user did not put in enough BNB to "trigger the front-running" and asks for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This tactic employs a [[psychological_tricks_in_scams | psychological trick]]: hoping the victim will invest more capital to recover their initial investment or achieve the promised profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

The core of the scam lies in the provided code itself; it's designed to trigger a call to an unknown wallet, meaning any funds involved are sent directly to the scammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Users are advised not to blindly copy and paste code without understanding where their funds are being sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Red Flags

Several [[common_cryptocurrency_scam_tactics | red flags]] are associated with this type of scam:
*   **Deceptive Channel Metrics** Some scam channels might have a large number of followers (e.g., 12,000) but only a single video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Unnaturally Positive Comments** The comment sections are often filled with comments that are "too good to be true"â€”all positive with no negative feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Requests for More Funds** A clear sign of a scam is when an initial test fails, and the scammer requests more funds to "make it work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Malicious Code** The provided code itself is designed to siphon funds by sending them to an unknown wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The Nexus Liquid Pylon Pool is an arbitrage opportunity available on the Terra protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It functions as a 24-month pool where users deposit UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Rewards and Structure

Participants in this pool receive Nexus tokens as a reward, currently offering an APR of approximately 15.73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The pool behaves like a bond: a deposit of 1,000 UST is expected to return 1,000 UST plus accumulated rewards at the end of the term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

A key distinction of the Liquid Pylon Pool compared to a regular Pylon Pool is the issuance of a receipt token called bPsiDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This bPsiDP token allows users to exit their position early by swapping it for UST on TerraSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Arbitrage Opportunity: The De-peg

Currently, there is a "de-peg" where the bPsiDP token trades at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For example, depositing 100 UST might yield 128 bPsiDP, yet the Pylon protocol records it as 128.973 UST deposited, indicating a de-peg of about 28% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This discrepancy might be due to a bearish market causing people to sell off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

To take advantage of this situation, one must be bullish on the [[investment_risks_and_rewards_with_nexus_token | Nexus token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Strategies

1.  **Wait for De-peg Resolution**: One strategy is to swap UST for bPsiDP at the de-pegged rate and then wait for the de-peg to resolve, allowing the bPsiDP to be swapped back for a higher amount of UST <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Hold**: In a worst-case scenario where the de-peg does not resolve, users can wait for the full 24-month lock-up period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For an initial 100 UST investment that yielded 128 bPsiDP, the user would still receive 128 UST back after 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. During this waiting period, [[investment_risks_and_rewards_with_nexus_token | Nexus token]] rewards are continuously earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Considerations

While the long-term hold offers a guaranteed return on the initial investment plus rewards, a 24-month waiting period is considered very long in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

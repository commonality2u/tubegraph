From: [[goingonchain]] <br/> 

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is a complex and deep subject that represents both a blessing and a problem for Ethereum and other blockchain networks, though it is particularly prominent and profitable on Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production in excess of the standard block reward and gas fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This extraction can be achieved by including, excluding, or even changing the order of transactions within a block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Historically, MEV was known as "Minor Extractable Value." However, with the transition to Proof-of-Stake and the [[Understanding the Ethereum Merge | Ethereum Merge]], the term evolved to "Maximal Extractable Value" as there are no longer miners, but validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. MEV is highly profitable, with total extracted MEV amounting to approximately $675 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## How MEV Works

[[Role of block producers in MEV | Block producers]], whether they are miners or validators, receive block rewards for performing block production and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Beyond these standard rewards, block producers hold the power to choose which transactions they process, allowing them to prioritize transactions that offer greater rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The process involves several steps:
1.  **Transaction Creation**: When a user performs an action like swapping tokens on Uniswap, making a purchase on OpenSea, or sending tokens to another wallet, they are creating a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  **Mempool Entry**: All these transactions enter a public "mempool," which acts as a holding area viewable by anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  **Validation and Inclusion**: Validators then pick up transactions from the mempool, validate them, and append them to the public ledger (the blockchain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
4.  **Transaction Selection**: Technically, validators have the authority to select pending transactions based on economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
5.  **Searchers**: In practice, independent actors known as "searchers" (often using bots) actively monitor the mempool for profitable transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These searchers then push these profitable transactions to validators. The MEV profits generated by searchers are shared with the block producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The maximum gas a searcher will pay is equivalent to the maximum payment a miner (or validator) would receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Value Extraction Strategies

Several strategies are employed to extract MEV:

### Gas Golfing
The objective of gas golfing is to process transactions using the least amount of gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Gas fee is calculated as gas price multiplied by gas used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This can be achieved in two ways:
1.  Having long strings of zeros in addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  Leaving small token balances in contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
Both methods reduce the space taken up by the transaction, thereby reducing gas usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Searchers can then increase the gas price to ensure their transaction is processed first while maintaining low gas consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Generalized Front-Running
When a bot identifies a profitable transaction in the mempool, it can copy the original transaction, increase the gas fee, and submit its own transaction to be processed first, effectively "front-running" other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Back-Running
This strategy involves acting immediately after a significant event, such as a token listing on a DEX like Uniswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For example, if a liquidity provider adds 50% of token A and 50% of stable B to a pool, bots monitoring the mempool can spot this transaction, immediately scoop up the token at a very low price, and then sell it later when the price rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This positions the bot as one of the very first traders in the new pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Flashbots
Flashbots connect searchers and [[Role of block producers in MEV | block producers]] in a private pool, which helps mitigate the impact of MEV on the public (such as inflated gas prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Searchers find opportunities in the mempool, bundle them, and send them to a Flashbot relay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. From there, block builders construct the most profitable blocks and send them to the validators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## [[Use cases for MEV such as dex arbitrage liquidation and sandwich trading | Use Cases for MEV]]

MEV is most commonly observed in several scenarios:

*   **DEX Arbitrage**: This involves exploiting price differences between two decentralized exchanges (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For instance, a searcher can buy a token on one DEX where it's cheaper and immediately sell it on another DEX where it's more expensive, often within a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Liquidation**: Bots constantly search for opportunities to liquidate undercollateralized loans in DeFi protocols, earning liquidation fees in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Sandwich Trading**: This occurs when a bot "sandwiches" a user's transaction. For example, if user A wants to buy 10,000 UNI tokens, a bot monitoring the transaction can front-run it by buying UNI tokens just before user A's transaction, and then back-run it by selling the UNI tokens back to user A at a higher price after user A's purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This results in user A experiencing price impact and high slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Kujira (initially referred to as Orca) is a project designed to allow retail investors to participate in liquidation auctions, specifically for assets like bLuna previously only accessible to large "whales" or "bots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. It facilitates the bidding for liquidated bLuna, where users can specify a premium they are willing to pay for the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Revenue Generation

Kujira generates revenue from two primary sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>:
*   **Smart Contract Execution Fees**: Kujira earns UST from the execution of its smart contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Fees**: A 1% fee is charged when users withdraw their discounted bLuna from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Kuji Token Utility

Kujira also has its native token called Kuji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Kuji tokens can be utilized to pay transaction fees on the platform, offering a discount ranging from 50% to 90% off the UST value of the fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Investor and Partner Landscape

The Kujira team is noted for having strong investors and partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The project was scheduled to conduct its Initial Decentralized Offering (IDO) on November 12th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Market Outlook

While Kujira's concept might not seem particularly exciting during a bull market, it could offer significant opportunities for acquiring assets at good deals when the market experiences a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Speaker's Disclosure
The speaker has stated they are not a "bastard," not whitelisted, and are unsure if they will participate in the IDO at the time of the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

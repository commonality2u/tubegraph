Bitcoin differs significantly from traditional financial assets like US Treasury bonds or gold in terms of its backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Bitcoin's Backing

Unlike traditional assets, [[bitcoins_backing_and_value | Bitcoin]] is not backed by any physical assets or any government body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This means that, theoretically, Bitcoin's value could go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Traditional Asset Backing

In contrast, assets such as US Treasury bonds and gold have physical or governmental backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

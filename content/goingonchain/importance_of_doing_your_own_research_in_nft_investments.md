The [[terra_nft_market_trends | Terra]] NFT market is experiencing significant activity, with many projects launching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. A Google Sheet, created by Lady Joe, tracks most of these projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. New launches, such as Galaxy Punk, are fetching good prices on the secondary market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, during periods of high excitement, the market can attract scammers and unusual incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Incidents Highlighting Risk

Two notable incidents on the [[terra_nft_market_trends | Terra]] blockchain illustrate the importance of caution and [[security_measures_for_nft_buyers | due diligence]]:

### Kara Waifu
This project launched without a clear presence and then suddenly executed a "rug pull" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. All of their social media accounts were deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It was also discovered that their artwork was copied from other projects on different blockchain networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Terabytes
The artist behind Terabytes abandoned the project, deleting all social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Interestingly, the artist donated all the project's funds to the Angel Protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. There were two circulating stories regarding the project's demise: some suggested public disapproval due to the artwork's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, while others claimed the art was generated using a "pixel dupe maker" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## The Need for Personal Research

Regardless of the specifics, both Kara Waifu and Terabytes are now defunct projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. These incidents underscore the critical need for investors to [[security_measures_for_nft_buyers | do their own research]] before engaging with any NFT project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

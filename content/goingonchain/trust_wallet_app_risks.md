Trust Wallet is a multi-chain software wallet designed for simplicity, allowing users to store various cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), and Cosmos (ATOM), within a single application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>. It supports 65 blockchains and covers most commonly owned assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:08">[01:59:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:44">[02:02:44]</a>.

### Limitations
While convenient, Trust Wallet has specific limitations:
*   **Maintenance and Support** The wallet is maintained and supported by Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:60">[01:51:60]</a>.
*   **Limited Configuration** It offers less configuration options compared to some other wallets, such as the inability to add custom networks or set custom Remote Procedure Call (RPC) nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:04">[01:55:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:99">[01:57:99]</a>.

To use it on a desktop, users must connect via WalletConnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:78">[02:11:78]</a>.

### Risks
A significant risk associated with Trust Wallet relates to imposter applications:
*   **Scam Chrome Extension** Users should be aware that any Trust Wallet extension found in the Chrome Web Store is a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

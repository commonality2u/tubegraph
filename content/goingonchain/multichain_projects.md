Multichain projects represent a significant area of interest in the cryptocurrency space for 2022 [00:02:04]. These projects aim to expand their reach and functionality across various blockchain networks. The speaker's personal portfolio includes holdings in Spell (SPELL) and Time (TIME), with plans to accumulate Ice (ICE) [00:02:06]. A sub-portfolio has been established with 40% TIME, 30% SPELL, and 30% ICE, with an aspiration for it to grow tenfold [00:02:11].

Three key multichain projects highlighted include Wonderland, Popsicle Finance, and Abracadabra.

## Wonderland (TIME)

Wonderland (TIME) is identified as the largest decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) [00:02:28]. It manages approximately $1 billion in assets [00:02:30] and actively generates revenue, making about $144,000 per day, which totals roughly $52 million annually [00:02:34]. Wonderland plans to initiate its [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multi-chain]] expansion starting in January [00:02:40].

## Popsicle Finance (ICE)

Popsicle Finance (ICE) specializes in yield optimization on Uniswap v3 [00:02:44]. With Uniswap v3 expanding to Polygon, Popsicle Finance will also follow suit [00:02:50]. This move is anticipated to bring a substantial influx of new users [00:02:52].

## Abracadabra (SPELL)

Abracadabra (SPELL) is noted for its existing [[multichain_lending_and_borrowing_protocol | multi-chain]] presence [00:03:01]. Currently, it operates on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) [00:03:03] and is soon expected to launch on Polygon [00:03:04]. The platform is actively used for managing internet money, demonstrated by the significant fees it generates weekly, visible on its dashboard [00:03:06].

Tangible is a marketplace designed to convert real-world assets into NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This platform allows for increased crypto adoption by integrating tangible assets into the digital space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## How Tangible Works

Tangible facilitates the purchase of physical items like gold bars, watches, and real estate using USDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

### Physical Assets

When a purchase is made on Tangible, a tNFT is minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The corresponding physical item is securely stored in a vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. [[storing_and_managing_highvalue_nfts_with_tangible | Storage fees]] apply for items held in the vault, which are typically high-value items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Users have the option to take delivery of their physical item at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Platform Fees

A 2.5% platform fee is charged when acquiring an item from another seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This fee is distributed as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>:
*   33% is used to buy and burn Tangible tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   66.66% goes to Tangible stakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Real Estate Tokenization

Tangible also enables the tokenization of real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Users can purchase fractions of a real estate property or acquire all fractions to own the entire asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The focus for real estate NFTs is on capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For example, a property might generate $494 per month in rent, with a net yield of approximately 15.17%, which includes both capital appreciation and rental yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[nft_with_passive_income | Yields]] are calculated after accounting for management and other fees, as Tangible handles legal, maintenance, and paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

There is a minimum fraction required for purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, and the yield does not commence until all property fractions have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## USDR Stablecoin

Tangible's real estate assets are used to back USDR, an over-collateralized stablecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. USDR is backed by a mix of real estate assets, Tangible tokens, DAI, and protocol-owned liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Learning from the UST incident, Tangible ensures USDR avoids a death spiral by requiring at least 88% of its backing to come from other assets before its native token can be used to mint USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Currently, USDR offers a yield of 4.25%, but Tangible plans to subsidize this to push the yield to approximately 6% to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Tangible Tokens

Tangible tokens have several [[utility_and_use_cases_of_nft_tokens | uses]]:
*   They can be used for minting USDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   They receive revenue from product sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Tangible tokens also apply a "v" concept, where staking and locking them converts them into an NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The longer the tokens are locked, the higher the rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Should a user wish to exit, they can sell their NFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, providing [[instant_liquidity_for_nft_buyers_and_sellers | instant liquidity]].

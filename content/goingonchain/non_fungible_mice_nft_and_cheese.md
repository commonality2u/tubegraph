Non Fungible Mice (NFM) is an NFT project that allows holders to earn [[nft_with_passive_income | passive income]] and engage in breeding mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Key Features and Mechanics

### Supply and Floor Price
The floor price for a Non Fungible Mice NFT is approximately 9 ETH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Initially, 10,000 mice were minted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. A significant portion, 6,450 mice, have been burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The remaining 3,550 mice are crucial as they are the only ones capable of breeding and producing new mice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Earning Cheese (Passive Income)
Non Fungible Mice NFTs operate differently from some other projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Holders can stake their mice to earn "cheese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Each staked mouse earns one cheese per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A maximum of 10 mice can be staked by a single user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Cheese can also be acquired through Uniswap or private sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Utility of Cheese and Breeding
Cheese serves a vital utility within the Non Fungible Mice ecosystem, primarily for breeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. With cheese, two mice can be bred to produce a new mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

However, there are two important conditions for breeding:
1.  The two parent mice used for breeding are burned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  The newly produced mouse cannot be bred again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Like the bananas from [[cyberkongz_nft_and_bananas | CyberKongz]] and honey from [[bear_deluxe_nft_and_honey | Bear Deluxe]], cheese has a specific use case that drives its market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

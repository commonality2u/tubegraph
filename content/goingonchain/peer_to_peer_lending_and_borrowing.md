Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and borrowing platforms like [[anchor_protocol_and_bluna_loans | Anchor]] facilitate direct financial interactions between lenders and borrowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These platforms allow individuals to deposit funds and earn interest, while others can borrow money by providing cryptocurrency as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## How it Works

On a P2P lending platform:
*   **Lenders** (e.g., Alice) can deposit money and earn a high interest rate, often ranging from 19% to 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For example, a lender might earn 19.53% interest on their deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Borrowers** (e.g., Bob) can borrow money by staking their crypto assets as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. They pay a floating interest rate on the borrowed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. As a reward for borrowing, they also receive ANC tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Maintaining High Yield for Lenders

The high yield offered to lenders is maintained through a combination of borrower interest payments and staking rewards from collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

1.  **Borrower APR**: Borrowers pay interest on the money they borrow. For instance, the borrow APR might be 21.55% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This means a borrower of $1,000 would pay $210 in interest over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  **Staking Rewards**: When borrowers stake their crypto as collateral, that collateral often generates a staking reward. This return can be around 5.83% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider an example where Alice lends $1,000, expecting a 20% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Bob borrows $1,000 using $3,000 in bLuna as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

*   Bob pays 22% interest on his $1,000 loan, amounting to $220 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   The $3,000 collateral staked by Bob earns a 5% staking reward, which is $150 ($3,000 * 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In total, $370 is collected from Bob ($220 from borrow APR + $150 from staking reward) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. From this collected amount:
*   $200 goes to Alice, the lender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   $170 goes to the [[anchor_protocol_and_bluna_loans | Anchor]] yield reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

This system demonstrates the power of decentralized finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

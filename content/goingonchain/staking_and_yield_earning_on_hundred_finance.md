## Introduction to Hundred Finance

Hundred Finance is a multi-chain lending and borrowing protocol available on eight different chains, including Polygon, Fantom, Arbitrum, and Optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It recently completed its first mirroring event, allowing users to transfer locked veHND tokens across supported chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Earning Yield on Hundred Finance

Users can engage in several activities on Hundred Finance to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]]:

### Staking Assets
One way to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] is by staking assets. For instance, staking $500 can yield approximately 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Supplying Collateral
Users can [[staking_and_borrowing_strategies_on_hundred_finance | supply assets]] and use them as collateral to borrow other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is part of [[providing_liquidity_and_using_lendi_on_hundred_finance | providing liquidity and using Lendi]].

### Backstop Provision
Another option is to participate in backstop provision, which involves supplying assets for liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This also allows users to [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earn yield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

When [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earning yield]] through these methods, rewards are distributed in HND tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Leveraging HND and mveHND for Boosted Yields

### Locking HND to mveHND
Users can take their earned HND tokens, lock them up, and convert them into mveHND (mirrored veHND) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Boosting APR with mveHND
With mveHND, users can vote for specific pools to boost their Annual Percentage Rate (APR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, to achieve an 86% APR on FRAX, sufficient HND tokens must be locked to secure a maximum boost of 2.5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Locking 300 HND for four years can provide a boost of approximately 1.5x, while 1000 HND can achieve the maximum 2.5x boost, significantly increasing rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

An example shows voting for a [[earning_interest_on_stablecoins | USDC pool]] with mirrored mveHND, resulting in a 1.07x boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Multi-Chain mveHND Mirroring

### What is Mirroring?
Hundred Finance's mirroring event allows users to transfer their locked veHND/mveHND from one chain (e.g., Fantom) to another (e.g., Polygon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This feature is powered by LayerZero service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. As of now, mveHND mirroring is supported on Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, and Polygon, though not all cross-chain directions are fully enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The Mirroring Process
The mirroring process is initiated from the vote page on the source chain (e.g., Fantom). Users select the "Mirror lock to a target chain" option, choose the destination chain, click "Mirror," and approve the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Benefits of Mirroring
Without mirroring, users would need to perform separate lockups on each chain they use Hundred Finance, leading to "double locking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Mirroring simplifies this by allowing users to easily transfer their locked tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This provides a significant incentive to use Hundred Finance on multiple chains, as users can immediately use their mveHND to boost APRs on pools across different networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

Hundred Finance offers various methods for [[earning_yield_on_hundred_finance | earning yield]], including staking, supplying collateral, and backstop provision. The ability to lock HND tokens into mveHND allows users to significantly boost their APRs, and the new multi-chain mirroring feature further enhances flexibility and utility across different networks.

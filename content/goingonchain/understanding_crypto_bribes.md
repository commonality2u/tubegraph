## What are Crypto Bribes?
A bribe traditionally involves an incentive, often given "under the table," as long as actions are taken without getting caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, crypto bribes operate differently; they are open and transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

In the context of decentralized finance (DeFi), a protocol might openly offer a share of a bribe to token holders to vote for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For example, a protocol might tell a holder to vote for them, and in return, the holder could receive a share of the bribe, potentially worth about 100k in tokens like fBEATS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[impact_of_crypto_bribes_on_decentralized_exchange_dex_tokens | Impact of Crypto Bribes on Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Tokens]]
Crypto bribes are changing the game for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Traditionally, liquidity pool (LP) providers and stakers engage in farming for DEX tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Protocols seek high liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, which LPs provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, LPs were often ready to sell ("dump") their DEX tokens at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The dynamic has shifted as DEXs now announce that a portion of their token emissions (e.g., 30%) will be distributed based on votes, with the protocol receiving the highest votes getting the largest share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Alignment of Incentives
This change in mechanism creates a powerful alignment of incentives among various stakeholders:

*   **Protocols**
    *   Protocols compete for votes to increase the DEX token rewards for their respective liquidity pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   This competition helps push up the price of their own protocol tokens as participants may buy them to chase high APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   Protocols can also buy DEX tokens to add buying pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, though they cannot sustain this indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Instead, they offer crypto bribes to DEX token holders to vote for their protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Liquidity Providers (LPs)**
    *   LPs are less willing to sell their DEX tokens because they need them to vote for their own pools, helping them win rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   This draws more LPs into their pools, leading to higher liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Stakers**
    *   Stakers, who already hold DEX tokens, have no reason to sell and can use their tokens to vote and earn more yield through bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

*   **Traders**
    *   High liquidity from LPs results in low slippage, making it attractive for traders to use the DEX and generating more trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Essentially, all incentives are aligned: stakers and LPs hold their DEX tokens to vote, traders benefit from low slippage, and protocols benefit from high liquidity and increased token purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This system also adds buying pressure to the DEX token itself, as holders seek to maximize their bribe earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## [[case_studies_on_crypto_bribes_beats_and_spirit_swap | Case Studies: Beats and Spirit Swap]]

### Beats
Prior to January of a given year, the token for the Beats DEX (DEX token) was prone to price drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. On January 6th, Beats began offering bribes, specifically 30% of their emission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This incentivized voting and gained traction, leading to increased demand and buying pressure for Beats tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While selling pressure may not be entirely eliminated, the buying pressure from bribes becomes significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Spirit Swap
Spirit Swap is another DEX that utilizes crypto bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. For example, GreeterDAO has offered bribes with Spirit Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This online incentive structure provides a strong reason to hold DEX tokens and to participate in crypto bribes, which also adds buying pressure to the creator token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Investing in DEX Tokens
When considering investments in DEX tokens, it is advisable to look for projects with similar incentive setups where all stakeholders (LPs, stakers, protocols, traders) have aligned interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Without such alignment, DEX tokens risk becoming mere farming tokens that are quickly sold off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

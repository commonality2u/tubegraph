Snowbank, a DeFi project, initially offered a high Annual Percentage Yield (APY) which was noted to be unsustainable and subsequently experienced a significant price drop of 45% after its initial video update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This occurred during a general downtrend in the crypto market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The lowest recorded price for Snowbank was $1600, from which it has slowly recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Initially, there were concerns about Snowbank being a "rug pull" due to the anonymity of the development team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. However, recent developments suggest the project is legitimate and actively building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Upcoming Initiatives

The Snowbank team is working on several new features and initiatives:

### Snowbank Pro Max
This new feature, similar to [[differences_between_snowdogdao_and_typical_olympusdao_forks | OlympusDAO Pro]], aims to help other projects manage their liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Snowbank will earn small fees from these services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Airdrop for Supporters
An airdrop is planned for users who engaged in [[staking_on_snowbank | staking on Snowbank]] or [[staking_on_snowbank | minting]] and supported the project during its most challenging period of low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Introduction of Snowdog
The project has released a new token called Snowdog (SDOG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Goal:** Snowdog aims to become the main coin of the [[avalanche_network_features | Avalanche]] network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** [[snowdogdao_overview_and_mechanisms | Snowdog]] utilizes a rebase token method for the first five days, followed by a large buyback of the coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. More detailed explanations of [[market_impact_and_asset_movement_from_snowbank_to_snowdog | Snowdog]]'s mechanics are available in a separate video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Spiritswap V2 introduces significant improvements to its user interface (UI) and overall user experience (UX) compared to its V1 predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The team aimed for a more seamless and less cluttered environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Overall UI Revamp
[[new_features_in_spiritswap_v2 | Spiritswap V2]] underwent a complete revamp of its UI, with the explicit goal of achieving a better user experience and making interactions more seamless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Homepage Enhancements
The V2 homepage now provides a clear overview of a user's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This comprehensive view considers five key components:
*   Tokens held in the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Liquidity provided on Spiritswap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
*   In-spirits being held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Set limit orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Any lending and borrowing activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

## Streamlined Bridging Process
The bridge functionality has also been revamped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In V1, users had to bridge assets from a mainnet (e.g., Ethereum) to the Fantom chain first, and then execute a separate swap to acquire Spiritswap tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In [[new_features_in_spiritswap_v2 | Spiritswap V2]], users can swap assets directly while bridging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This means a user can transfer assets from Ethereum to the Fantom chain and immediately receive Spiritswap tokens or any other available Fantom chain tokens, all within a single transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Users can also select bridge modes, choosing between "cheapest" (for the best rate, but longer time) and "fastest" (for quicker execution, but potentially not the best rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Organized Liquidity and In-Spirit Pages
The liquidity management now has its own dedicated tab, organized into "Classic" and "Stable" categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. While this might appear unchanged, significant improvements exist "under the hood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

The in-spirit page has also seen a major UI improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Unlike the V1 page which was described as cluttered and messy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, the [[new_features_in_spiritswap_v2 | Spiritswap V2]] version is much clearer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, offering:
*   A clear voting page to track vote allocation and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>
*   A dashboard displaying current in-spirit balance and locked spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
*   A "claimable bribes reward" section, making it easier for users to track and claim their rewards, which was previously a tedious process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

DC DAO is an OHM fork with a unique twist, aiming to become a "treasury of treasuries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The product is not yet launched, but a preview outlines its core mechanics and launch strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Tokenomics

### Core Functionality
Like other OHM forks, users can bond DC DAO's token, EGS, to mint it at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Staking EGS tokens allows users to earn interest, with an initial APY of 50,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Minting tokens enables DC DAO to build its treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. The DAO aims to accumulate assets such as WMEMO, OHM, and MIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Integrated DEX
A key feature is an integrated DEX filled with assets from WMEMO, OHM, Hector, and Exodia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This DEX allows users to swap tokens through a cycle:
*   Swap EGS for WMEMO after rebase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   Swap WMEMO for OHM after 1 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   Swap OHM for Hector after 2 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   Continue this cycle (e.g., swapping for Exodia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

The team projects that one full cycle could yield about 3.78%, and three cycles a day could yield about 11.34% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. While currently manual, the team is exploring automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Swap fees generated on the DEX will go into the treasury, potentially funding the EGS staking APY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Initial [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] Offering (INO)
DC DAO's launch mechanism is an "Initial [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] Offering," where purchasing an [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] grants token allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] sale will be an auction with three tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>:
*   **God Tier:** Highest tier, starting bid of 4200 FTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Dante Tier:** Example given for 500 FTM, awarding a max of 600 FTM worth of EGS allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. At an FTM price of $3 and EGS pre-sale price of $1, a Dante tier [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] could allow purchasing 1920 EGS tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Damning God** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

[[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] holders receive special boosts, such as a 2.5% staking boost and a 5% bonding boost for Dante tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. There is also a lottery component where, for example, a "Bronze Dante" could yield an additional 25% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### [[token_distribution_and_rewards | Token Distribution]]
The [[token_distribution_and_rewards | tokenomics]] indicate that 80% of the offering will go to the [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] auction, which is seen as positive because it directs a large portion of tokens to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. The team retains 10% of tokens, and 10% is allocated for initial liquidity supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The team's tokens have a six-month vesting period with a two-month cliff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

> "I like to point out that 80% of the offering will go to the [[nft_tokenization_and_voting | NFT]] auction which is good because much of the tokens will go out to the public." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>

## Team Structure

The DC DAO team is anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. However, they claim to have diverse experience, including bankers, scientists, and lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. DC DAO has a partnership with SpiritSwap, and one of SpiritSwap's members is a multi-sig signer for DC DAO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

A concern raised is that the team's vesting period of six months with a two-month cliff seems "a bit short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

> "The team is unknown and the team vesting is a bit short in my opinion." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>

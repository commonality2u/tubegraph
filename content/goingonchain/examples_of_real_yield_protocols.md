[[Real Yield in DeFi | Real yield]] is a newer concept in the [[Decentralized finance and yield reserves | DeFi]] space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It differs significantly from earlier [[Yield Farming vs Real Yield | yield farming]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Traditional Yield Farming vs. Real Yield

During the early days of [[Yield farming to grow cryptocurrency | yield farming]], protocols often offered very high Annual Percentage Yields (APYs), sometimes exceeding 10,000% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This model typically involved users buying the platform's native token, locking it, and earning more of the same token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These tokens were often highly inflationary, leading users to "rush to sell" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

In contrast, [[Real Yield in DeFi | real yield]] protocols provide rewards in a different format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. When users interact with the protocol, a portion of the generated revenue is distributed to token holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. These rewards are typically given in "mainstream assets" such as Ether (ETH) or stablecoins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Examples of Real Yield Protocols

Several protocols exemplify the [[Real Yield in DeFi | real yield]] model:

*   **GMX**
    When users stake GMX tokens, they earn GMX tokens along with ETH rewards against the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **GNS**
    Staking GNS tokens allows users to earn a 4% yield in DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Umami**
    Users who deposit into Umami can earn ETH rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Kujira**
    Now operating on its own blockchain, staking Kujira tokens enables users to collect rewards in various types of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Valuation Models for Real Yield Protocols

Common valuation models for [[Real Yield in DeFi | real yield]] protocols often involve comparing metrics to understand how protocols generate revenue and fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Typically, analysts will assess transaction volume and the fees generated from that volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. From this data, a ratio can be calculated to estimate the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, which helps in determining if a platform is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Tools for Data Collection

Several tools can assist in gathering the necessary data for these valuations:
*   **Token Terminal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   **Dune Analytics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, which hosts dashboards built by data analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Many protocols also feature their own dedicated statistics pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Valuation

When performing valuations, several factors should be noted:
*   **Supply Figures** The choice between using circulating supply versus total supply can lead to vastly different results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Emissions as Expenses** Token emissions, used to incentivize users, should be treated as expenses in the valuation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Blockchain Chain** The underlying blockchain is important. For example, a protocol like dYdX moving to Cosmos could impact user adoption due to changes in security, wallet requirements, and interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

There is no single "right or wrong" valuation model, as the best approach depends on how it is constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

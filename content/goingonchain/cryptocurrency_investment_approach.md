The market is currently experiencing a bearish sentiment, leading to a portfolio being down by approximately 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite this, the long-term outlook on [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | crypto adoption]] remains positive, with no fundamental changes in the underlying technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Navigating Bear Markets

A key principle of this [[crypto_portfolio_strategy | crypto portfolio strategy]] is to accumulate assets during a bear market, as this is considered the best time to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, this approach requires the ability to "stomach the pain" associated with market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)

To mitigate risk and avoid "catching the falling knife," the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This involves continuing to DCA into strong projects like Bitcoin (BTC), FTM, and Merit Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Project-Specific Strategies

### Luna (LUNA)

For Luna, accumulation is being done using the Anchor Pro strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Frog Nation (wMEMO, SPELL, ICE)

Projects under the "Frog Nation" umbrella, such as wMEMO, SPELL, and ICE, are held in both the main and "gem" portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **wMEMO:** A short-term trading approach is used for wMEMO, involving "scripting" each time there is an AMA (Ask Me Anything) session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, wMEMO was sold three days prior to an update and then bought back the day after an AMA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This is explicitly stated as not a long-term holding strategy, with intentions to sell soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **SPELL and ICE:** These tokens are being held longer-term based on the belief they are good products, despite acknowledgments that the "token dynamics is not so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Important Considerations for [[investing_in_cryptocurrency | Cryptocurrency Investing]]

> [!CAUTION]
> Always [[managing_risk_with_crypto_investments | invest]] with money you can afford to lose because [[introduction_to_cryptocurrencies | crypto]] is super volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

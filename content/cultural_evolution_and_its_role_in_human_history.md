This article summarizes key concepts regarding cultural evolution and its impact on human history, drawing from a discussion with Professor Joseph Henrich, a professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University and author of *The Secret of Our Success* and *The Weirdest People in the World* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The "Secret of Our Success": The Collective Brain

The central thesis of *The Secret of Our Success* is that humans have thrived due to a "package of things" [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | the role of cultural and technological innovations in human evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, primarily our capacity for cumulative cultural evolution. This refers to the ability of human populations to accumulate knowledge, technologies, and social practices over generations, forming a "collective brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### The Startup Problem of Cultural Learning

A key puzzle is why cumulative cultural evolution is relatively uncommon in the natural world, seemingly unique to the human lineage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This can be understood as a "startup problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>:
*   Investing brain tissue in social learning is only beneficial if there is a substantial body of useful cultural knowledge to learn.
*   However, without the ability for social learning, such a body of knowledge cannot accumulate.
*   In a world with little cumulative culture, it's more advantageous to use brain tissue for individual problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Overcoming the Startup Problem

Several factors likely converged around 2-3 million years ago, allowing our ancestors to overcome this "valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>:
1.  **Environmental Fluctuations:** An increase in the rate of environmental change during the Plio-Pleistocene transition favored cultural evolution. Culture is most advantageous when the environment changes at a moderate pace – slow enough for previous generations' knowledge to be useful, but not so slow that [[the_effects_of_agriculture_on_human_genetics_and_societal_development | genetic encoding is sufficient]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>.
2.  **Bipedalism and Tool Use:** As ground-dwelling apes, humans possessed hands capable of tool use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
3.  **Large Social Groups:** Living on the savanna, possibly in response to a dense predator guild, our ancestors may have lived in large groups (perhaps a few hundred individuals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Larger groups increase the probability that someone within the group possesses useful, albeit sparse, cultural information, making social learning more viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
4.  **Pre-existing Large Brains:** Our lineage already consisted of big-brained primates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Cultural Accumulation and Transmission

### Learning and Innovation
Cultural knowledge, including complex technologies and practices, accumulates through several mechanisms:
*   **Preferential Learning:** Even young children exhibit a tendency to learn from healthier, more successful, or more prestigious individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This can lead to the gradual refinement of practices, such as cassava processing, where households that process it more effectively might have more children and be copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **Learning Without Understanding:** Individuals often adopt and transmit complex cultural practices (e.g., food processing, tool making) without a full causal understanding of why they work. When asked, people often cite "custom" or tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. For example, Hadza bow makers understand some mechanics but not all, and haven't experimented with different materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Error as Novelty:** Mistakes or errors in copying can inadvertently lead to innovations or novel solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.
*   **Selection Strength:** While strong, deleterious effects like cyanide poisoning can drive rapid cultural adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>, cultural evolution can also pick up on small advantages over long periods (e.g., 1,000 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. For instance, spices with antimicrobial properties might confer a small but significant health benefit in environments with high pathogen loads, leading to improved health and even IQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Inter-Group Dynamics
*   **Competition and Copying:** When groups meet, they compete for resources. Successful groups' technologies or institutions might be copied by others, sometimes facilitated by migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Violent Conflict:** Ancient DNA evidence, including from David Reich's lab, suggests that expansions often involved violent conflict and the replacement of genetic lineages [[genetic_evidence_and_ancient_human_migrations | genetic evidence and ancient human migrations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Human Expansions and Cultural Packages

Human history is characterized by population expansions driven by cultural advantages. These expansions often involve a "package of things" – a combination of technologies, social organization, and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### The Eurasian Expansion (c. 70,000 years ago)
Around 70,000 years ago, a relatively small group of humans (possibly 1,000-10,000 people) in the Near East expanded across Eurasia, largely replacing or interbreeding with existing populations like Neanderthals and Denisovans [[neanderthals_denisovans_and_their_genetic_contributions_to_modern_humans | Neanderthals, Denisovans, and their genetic contributions to modern humans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **No Obvious Genetic Change:** Genetic evidence does not show significant genetic changes in the expanding group that would explain their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Neanderthals, for instance, had larger brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Institutional/Technological Changes:** The expansion was likely driven by institutional changes that allowed for better interconnectedness and more sophisticated technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This could have included projectile weapons like bows and arrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Tool indications also suggest more complex technology linked with social organization [[cultural_transmission_knowledge_accumulation_and_social_learning | cultural transmission, knowledge accumulation, and social learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Larger Population Size:** DNA of the expanding groups suggests a larger population size compared to Neanderthals in Europe, indicating a larger "collective brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Other Notable Expansions
*   **Bantu Expansion (c. 5,000 years ago):** Eliminated many pre-existing hunter-gatherer populations in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Austronesian Expansion:** The peopling of the Pacific by one group at the expense of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Neolithic Expansion into Europe:** Another example of population replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Australian Hunter-Gatherer Expansion (c. 6,000 years ago):** A group from northern Australia expanded to cover seven-eighths of the continent, possessing new social organization, including linguistic exogamy and rituals that interconnected populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Inuit Expansion:** Expanded from Alaska across the Arctic to Greenland, with a package including interconnected social practices, bows and arrows (which the displaced Dorset people lacked), dogs, sleds, and whaling boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Factors Influencing the Collective Brain

### Population Size and Interconnectedness
*   **Eurasia's Advantages:** Eurasia, being the largest continent with an east-west axis, facilitated the flow of ideas and people, particularly along the "Lucky Latitudes" (Southern China to the Mediterranean) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This larger collective brain contributed to more inventions originating there, including the wheel (though Mayan toys had wheels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Loss of Knowledge through Fragmentation:** Populations that become isolated can lose technology. This may have happened to the Dorset people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Languages naturally diversify, and groups may become endogamous, reducing contact and leading to cultural fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Maintaining unity is a constant challenge [[impact_of_cultural_values_on_war_conduct | impact of cultural values on war conduct]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Social Organization and Institutions
The ability to organize and cooperate, facilitated by institutions, is crucial. Even before the agricultural revolution, trade and genetic transmission occurred between groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The development of state capacity can be seen as an innovative process of the collective brain, arising from experimentation with governance [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## The "Lost European Explorer" Problem and Human Dependence on Culture

Humans are heavily reliant on culturally acquired knowledge. Numerous accounts of "Lost European Explorers" describe individuals with then-modern technologies starving in environments where indigenous populations thrived for tens of thousands of years using sophisticated local knowledge (e.g., food processing, hunting techniques) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   This highlights that humans have "offloaded" many biological functions to culture. For example, we are worse than chimpanzees at detoxifying foods because cultural practices (like cooking or multi-step processing) do this work externally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>. Camels, with their innate instincts (e.g., smelling water, detoxifying food), could survive where explorers perished [[impact_of_cultural_values_on_war_conduct | impact of cultural values on war conduct]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.
*   Human brains are not inherently superior at individual problem-solving in novel environments without this cultural toolkit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## Cultural Learning and Human Life History

*   **Extended Development:** Humans have extended childhoods and post-menopausal lifespans, likely to facilitate the acquisition and transmission of complex cultural knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.
*   **Decades of Learning:** Acquiring essential skills takes a long time. For example, hunter-gatherer males reach their physical peak in their early 20s, but their hunting proficiency (knowledge of animals, tracks, behavior) peaks between 36 and 40. Young hunters (e.g., 18 years old) often don't produce enough food to feed themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

## Cultural Evolution in the Modern World and WEIRD Psychology

### Persistence of Cultural Traits
Cultural practices and their psychological effects can persist for long periods, even after the original environmental or economic conditions change:
*   **Plow Agriculture and Gender Inequality:** A history of plow agriculture (requiring male upper body strength) correlates with greater gender inequality today, even in non-farming populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.
*   **Pastoralism and Gender Norms:** Ancestral pastoralism, associated with strong gender norms, continues to shape outcomes like female entrepreneurship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

### The "WEIRD" Phenomenon
Populations from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies exhibit distinct psychological profiles, including high individualism, analytic (vs. holistic) thinking, impersonal prosociality (trust in strangers), and lower conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.
*   **The Church's Role:** A key argument in *The Weirdest People in the World* is that a specific branch of Christianity (what became the Catholic Church) systematically dismantled intensive kinship systems in Europe [[impact_of_kinship_systems_on_societal_development | impact of kinship systems on societal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:45">[00:46:45]</a>.
    *   **Mechanisms:** This involved outlawing polygyny, banning cousin marriage (out to sixth cousins, including spiritual kin), and altering inheritance rules (allowing testamentary inheritance, e.g., to the Church, rather than strict patrilineal inheritance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. This broke down large corporate land-holding kin groups tied to ancestral lands.
    *   **Consequences:** This led to the rise of small, monogamous nuclear families (rare globally), freeing individuals from strong kin obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. This, in turn, spurred the growth of voluntary associations (guilds, self-help societies), occupational sorting, urbanization (charter towns), universities, new forms of monasteries, and individual-based legal systems (e.g., contract law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This enhanced the flow of ideas and innovation, eventually contributing to the Industrial Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.
    *   **Church's Motivation:** While St. Augustine mentioned benefits of marrying distantly, there's little evidence the Church consciously aimed to destroy kinship ties for this societal outcome. The changes likely benefited the Church by freeing individuals to invest more heavily in it (e.g., land donations, priestly celibacy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
*   **Pre-Christian Europe:** While ancient Greece and Rome had interesting developments (e.g., Athenian monogamy for citizens, though slave concubines were allowed), they still largely featured intensive kinship, patrilineal systems, and clan-based politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>. Data shows a clear correlation between the number of centuries a European region was under Church influence and the reduction of intensive kinship practices [[the_fall_of_the_roman_empire | the fall of the Roman Empire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.
*   **Comparison with China:** While China had a much larger population (potential collective brain) around 1500 CE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>, Europe's transformation of kinship structures led to increased individual mobility, urbanization (surpassing China by 1200 CE), and diverse occupational structures (guilds with apprenticeships between strangers), intensifying its collective brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>.
*   **Comparison with India:** The ancient caste system in India, visible in genetic data, likely hindered innovation by restricting occupational mobility based on talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. However, India was a source of significant innovations, like "Arabic" numerals (actually Indian) and the concept of zero, which flowed into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

### Factors Maintaining European Interconnectedness
*   **Lingua Franca:** Latin served as a common language for intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Christendom:** Provided an overarching network. The requirement to marry other Christians helped dissolve tribal lines through intermarriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.
*   **Roman Legacy:** Roman roads facilitated movement, and the ideal of the empire persisted, with rulers like Charlemagne working with the Church to enforce marriage and family programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

### Modern Innovation and Cultural Transmission
*   **Pace of Change:** In rapidly changing environments, the value of knowledge from older generations diminishes. Optimally, individuals might look to relatively younger role models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>.
*   **Learning What to Focus On:** Modern innovation still shows cultural transmission. For example, individuals are much more likely to patent in the same fine-grained domain as their same-sex parent (e.g., natural vs. synthetic adhesives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Growing up in Silicon Valley increases the likelihood of patenting in computers, while Boston upbringing correlates with biotech patents, even if individuals later move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This reflects learning *what to focus on* [[impact_and_future_of_ai_in_economic_systems | impact and future of AI in economic systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

### Immigration and Cultural Diversity
*   **Innovation from Diversity:** Cultural diversity in US counties ( proxied by immigration) was a driver of patent quality and quantity from c. 1850-1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.
*   **Assimilation and Integration:** Immigrants from more culturally distant societies (e.g., high distrust) may take longer to integrate into the collective brain. However, cultural traits like distrust tend to diminish by an order of magnitude each generation in a new cultural context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.
*   **Reciprocal Assimilation (Spaghetti Theory):** Immigrants assimilate, but also influence the host culture (e.g., Italian food becoming American) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. For social traits like trust, a high-trust society creates pressure for low-trust individuals to adapt, as collaboration is beneficial. Ethnic enclaves might preserve low trust, but distribution can facilitate assimilation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:44">[01:14:44]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

### Brain Size and IQ
*   **Declining Brain Size:** Human brain size has been declining for the last 10,000 years. This might be due to specialization within the collective brain; as society stores knowledge and individuals specialize, individual brainpower might be less critical, similar to specialized ants having smaller brains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
*   **IQ as a Cultural Construct:** IQ tests measure cognitive abilities useful for navigating contemporary institutions [[impact_of_intelligence_and_skills_on_economic_progress | impact of intelligence and skills on economic progress]]. The Flynn effect (rising IQ scores over the 20th century) suggests IQ reflects culturally acquired skills, not just innate intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. Different environments favor different cognitive suites (e.g., spatial navigation for Namibian herders) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Polygenic scores for education show selection over the last 10,000 years in European samples, but this may reflect traits like conscientiousness rather than raw computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
*   **Potential for Collective Brain Expansion:** AI could significantly expand the collective brain, offering efficient knowledge replication and communication [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | Impact of AI on future technology and society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.
*   **Concerns:**
    *   **Loss of Serendipity and Error:** Innovation often relies on serendipitous meetings (e.g., coffee shop encounters in Silicon Valley) and "improper copying" (mistakes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. Highly faithful AI replication might stifle this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
    *   **Homogeneity and Shocks:** A too-homogeneous AI system might lack the dynamism spurred by external shocks (economic, environmental, conflict) that inject new information and challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.
    *   **Lack of "Care":** Humans have motivations and goals that drive invention; AIs are currently tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>.
    *   **Institutional Innovation:** Cultural evolution has produced complex institutional innovations (e.g., moralizing gods, family structures) that AIs might not conceive of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
*   **Replication of Culture:** AI could allow high-fidelity replication of successful organizational cultures (like SpaceX), but this needs to account for changing historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

### Societal Trends
*   **Loss of Cultural Diversity:** The global spread of WEIRD culture and the loss of languages reduces the overall cultural variation, which could be detrimental to future adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. However, new unique cultural fusions are also emerging (e.g., Japan adopting WEIRD institutions but retaining distinct practices) [[impact_of_cultural_values_on_war_conduct | impact of cultural values on war conduct]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.
*   **Fragility of WEIRD Psychology:** Impersonal institutions and associated psychology (e.g., moral universalism) might be fragile and are observed to be declining in some areas (e.g., rural US since 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.
*   **Declining Fertility:** Low fertility rates globally are a concern for the "collective brain" size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>. Cultural evolution may favor pronatalist ideologies or religions, as such groups would have a demographic advantage over time (e.g., historical spread of Christianity, Mormonism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:38">[01:24:38]</a>.
*   **Institutional Decay and Competition:** The decline in great power conflict might reduce selective pressures that historically drove institutional efficiency. "Domesticating competition" through internal mechanisms (like sports teams or firm competition) or instituting "sunset clauses" for bureaucratic departments could be potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:05">[01:28:05]</a>.
*   **The Internet's Impact:** The internet has not yet produced the expected explosion in innovation. Face-to-face interaction remains crucial for building trust and idea flow, especially between culturally different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:53">[01:34:53]</a>.

### Epistemology and Science
*   **Cultural Evolution of Epistemology:** What counts as good evidence or a strong argument is itself culturally evolved. A significant shift in Europe was moving away from reliance on ancient authorities (like Aristotle) towards empirical evidence [[scientific_and_technological_developments_in_ai | scientific and technological developments in AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:54">[01:32:54]</a>.
*   **Science and Diversity:** Scientific papers tend to be more impactful when authors are from diverse societies, though researchers often prefer collaborating with those from similar backgrounds. Polycentricity in science funding and varied research approaches are desirable [[exploring_the_future_of_society_and_economy_with_ai | exploring the future of society and economy with AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:42">[01:33:42]</a>.

## Studying Cultural Evolution

*   **Using AI for Historical Psychology:** Modern AI techniques allow researchers to measure psychological traits from large textual corpora. For example, by comparing ancient Chinese texts to validated English psychological questionnaires (using semantic similarity), researchers can track changes in individualism or moral universalism across Chinese history and correlate them with factors like kinship intensity, finding similar patterns to those in Europe [[ai_and_machine_learning_in_historical_text_analysis | AI and Machine Learning in Historical Text Analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:51">[01:19:51]</a>.
*   **Thinking in Collectives:** Humans may have evolved to think and solve problems in groups. Many individual cognitive biases diminish or disappear when problems are tackled collectively, suggesting our minds are adapted for distributed cognition [[rationality_and_decision_theory | rationality and decision theory]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:30">[01:52:30]</a>.

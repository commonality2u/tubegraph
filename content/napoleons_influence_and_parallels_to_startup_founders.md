Here is the modified article:

Andrew Roberts, historian and author, discusses the surprising "cult of Napoleon" within the startup community [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. Startup founders reportedly see parallels between their own endeavors and Napoleon's characteristics and achievements, with Roberts' biography of Napoleon being considered "part of the canon" for this group [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

## Characteristics Resonating with the Startup Ethos

Several aspects of Napoleon's personality and career align with the values and experiences often found in the startup world:

*   **Youthful Dynamism and Competence:** Napoleon is described as a "young upstart, just stupendously energetic and competent" [[the_impact_and_philosophy_of_san_francisco_on_innovation_and_entrepreneurship | the impact and philosophy of San Francisco on innovation and entrepreneurship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. He was significantly more efficient than the established bureaucracies and old systems around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.
*   **Reformer and Intellectual Curiosity:** He was a reformer, "tremendously intellectually curious," and an "autodidact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.
*   **Fascination with Innovation:** Napoleon was "totally fascinated by every new thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>. This included:
    *   Ideas for balloons and submarines [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | impact of AI on future technology and society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
    *   Agricultural development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:42">[01:00:42]</a>.
    *   Building bridges faster, better, and cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
    *   Giving prizes for new chemical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.
*   **Support for Science and Entrepreneurship:** He actively supported inventors and entrepreneurs, whom he believed would help France surpass Britain in the Industrial Revolution [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>. His embrace of science had a strong nationalist motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
*   **Genuine Interest in Learning:** Napoleon was made a fellow of the French Academy due to his genuine interest, not just his political power. He would attend their meetings, such as one on electricity, and take notes as First Consul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:32">[01:01:32]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

## Leadership Style and Modern Parallels

Roberts suggests that if Napoleon were alive today, he would likely be a tech entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, creating a company to "advance mankind" and potentially acquiring other companies, much like he invaded countries [[role_of_tech_entrepreneurs_in_modern_warfare | role of tech entrepreneurs in modern warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:41">[01:05:41]</a>. His approach to leadership also offers parallels:

*   **Micromanagement and Efficiency:** His tendency to micromanage every aspect of the Empire with high energy and efficiency is compared to modern figures like Elon Musk [[entrepreneurial_challenges_and_venture_capital_dynamics | entrepreneurial challenges and venture capital dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:51]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>.
*   **Engagement with Intellectuals:** Upon entering new territories, like Milan, Napoleon would gather intellectuals, writers, scientists, and chemists to discuss their work [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>, positioning himself as an intellectual leader, a contrast to the Bourbon rulers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.
*   **Forward-Thinking Social Reforms:** He demonstrated progressive thinking for his era by going into ghettos in towns he entered, freeing the Jews, and granting them civil and religious rights [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>.
*   **Meritocracy:** Napoleon was a "true believer in meritocracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>. Thirteen of his 26 marshals came from working-class backgrounds, including sons of peasants, innkeepers, and domestic servants. He appointed them based on natural leadership and perceived luck, elevating them to dukes, princes, and even kings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>.
*   **Advisory Council:** Despite his dictatorial power, Napoleon was skilled at choosing advisors for areas outside his expertise, such as the legal experts who drafted the Napoleonic Code [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:35">[01:10:35]</a>. He valued competence regardless of an advisor's social status or personal life, as seen with Cambacérès, who was openly gay at a time when it was illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:56">[01:10:56]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:24">[01:11:24]</a>.

## The Pattern of Greatness and Hubris

The discussion touches upon the common trajectory of great figures whose "double or nothing gambles" lead to immense success but can also result in their downfall as luck runs out [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.

*   **Hubris:** This is described as an "occupational hazard of hugely successful people" [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.
*   **The Russian Campaign (1812):** Roberts argues that Napoleon's decision to invade Russia in 1812 was not initially an "insane hubristic mad decision" [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii | historical analysis of World War I and World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>. He had defeated the Russians twice before, possessed a massive army, and did not initially plan to go deep into Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>.
*   **The Continental Blockade:** The truly "mad" and "hubristic" decision, according to Roberts, was attempting to defeat Britain by imposing a continental blockade on all of Europe. This protectionist policy aimed at stopping smuggling and trade with Britain ultimately led to the costly Peninsula campaign [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii | historical analysis of World War I and World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.

The challenge for such exceptional individuals lies in balancing their proven ability to achieve what others deem impossible with recognizing their own limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:45">[01:09:45]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>.

## Early Literary Endeavors

An interesting biographical detail shared by both Napoleon and Winston Churchill is that they wrote novels in their early twenties. These novels featured characters who saved their respective countries in battle and won over a "pretty maiden" [[churchill_as_an_applied_historian | Churchill as an applied historian]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>. Napoleon's novel was titled *Klisson and Eugenie* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>.

While Roberts acknowledges that liking Napoleon can also appeal to "megalomaniacs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:13">[01:02:13]</a>, the multifaceted nature of Napoleon's character, particularly his drive, innovation, and reformist zeal, explains his appeal to the modern startup founder [[the_impact_and_philosophy_of_san_francisco_on_innovation_and_entrepreneurship | the impact and philosophy of San Francisco on innovation and entrepreneurship]].

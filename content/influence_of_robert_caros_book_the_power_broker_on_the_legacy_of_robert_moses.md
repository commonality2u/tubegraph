Robert Caro's 1974 biography, *The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York*, has had a profound and lasting impact on the public perception and historical understanding of Robert Moses. While acknowledged by Professor Kenneth T. Jackson as a monumental work, its portrayal of Moses and his impact on New York City is also subject to critique and reinterpretation.

## Overview and Initial Reception

*The Power Broker* brought Robert Moses to widespread public attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Before its publication, while Moses was a powerful figure, most Americans were not familiar with his name or the extent of his work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The book made him famous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The book's subtitle, "Robert Moses and the Fall of New York," reflected the prevailing sentiment in the 1970s, a period considered a low point in New York City's history, marked by bankruptcy, rising crime, and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Professor Kenneth T. Jackson's Assessment

Professor Jackson considers *The Power Broker* "the best book I ever read" and "a stunning achievement," noting that in broad strokes, its depiction of Moses's immense power is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>. He praises Caro's ability to convey the stunning scope of Moses's achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Points of Agreement with Caro

Jackson agrees with Caro on several key aspects of Moses:
*   Moses possessed more power than any urban figure in American history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:36">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   He built incredible monuments that the city needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.
*   Moses was ruthless, arrogant, and self-centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>.
*   He was also financially honest, dying with less money than he started with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   Caro correctly identified that Moses, despite being the greatest builder of New York, didn't actually like the city as it was, preferring a suburban model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>.
*   Even Caro acknowledges that the scandals that eventually brought Moses down were relatively trivial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Critiques and Reinterpretations

Despite his admiration for the book, Professor Jackson believes it is flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> and contains "a thousand errors, just small errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.
*   **The "Fall" of New York:** Jackson argues that Caro's premise of "the fall of New York" is incorrect. Instead, Jackson's 2007 work posits "Robert Moses and the *rise* of New York," suggesting that without Moses's projects, New York might have declined like Detroit or St. Louis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This notion ties into the broader discussion of [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation]].
*   **Sources:** Jackson suggests Caro relied too heavily on Moses's own documents, which reflected Moses's narrow view of himself and limited attention to broader contexts like developments in Los Angeles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.
*   **Public Transit:** Jackson asserts Caro was "exactly wrong" about Moses causing the decline of public transit. He argues the real question is why public transit *survived* so well in New York compared to other US cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. While Moses didn't help public transit, he didn't destroy it; he was swimming with the historical tide favoring automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. This aligns with studies on the [[impact_of_oil_on_historical_and_modern_geopolitics]].
*   **Neighborhood Destruction:** Regarding the destruction of neighborhoods like East Tremont for the Cross Bronx Expressway, Jackson contends Caro mischaracterizes the situation, stating that census data shows Jewish populations were already leaving such areas, and that similar neighborhood changes occurred in parts of the Bronx not directly impacted by the expressway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Jackson states Caro "wouldn't know those neighborhoods if he landed there by parachute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

Professor Jackson notes that his students, when researching aspects of *The Power Broker*, consistently found discrepancies with Caro's accounts, often concluding that "This is not what this is not the way he said it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>.

### Specific Factual Disagreements

Jackson points to several specific claims in *The Power Broker* that he believes are incorrect:
*   The temperature in swimming pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   The narrative of the destruction of public transit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   The depiction of the destruction of the Bronx by the Cross Bronx Expressway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   The claim that bridges were built too low to prevent buses from reaching beaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   The assertion that New York received more federal money for projects than other cities (Jackson's students found Chicago, for example, received more per person for some projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

## Reasons for the Book's Prominence

Professor Jackson suggests several reasons for *The Power Broker*'s significant cultural impact:
*   **Timing and Prevailing Attitudes:** The book resonated with contemporary opinions, particularly a growing sentiment that "Old is better" and a skepticism towards large-scale development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:19">[00:53:19]</a>. Moses represented a past era of wanting to build massive infrastructure, a mindset no longer in vogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:22">[01:29:22]</a>. This reflects broader trends in [[historical_and_modern_perspectives_on_urban_development_and_public_works]].
*   **Caro's Writing and Argument:** Caro is a "terrific writer" who presents a clear, understandable argument that runs through the entire book, building suspense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>.
*   **Subject's Relative Obscurity:** Before Caro, Moses was not a widely known historical figure like presidents. *The Power Broker* was such a large and intimidating work that it deterred others from tackling the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>.
*   **Meticulous Research (in some areas):** Caro's dedication to interviewing even minor figures from Moses's past, like a third-grade teacher, contributed to the book's depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:47">[01:22:47]</a>.

## Moses's Response to "The Power Broker"

Robert Moses himself wrote a lengthy response to *The Power Broker*, published in *The New Yorker* around 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>. Professor Jackson characterizes this response as "rambling, wordy, not particular," and believes Moses could have more effectively rebutted Caro but failed to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:27">[01:25:27]</a>. The podcast host notes that Moses's response seemed to vindicate Caro's description of his personality, being ad hominem and not specific about major alleged errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:58">[01:24:58]</a>.

## Personal Interactions Between Professor Jackson and Robert Caro

Professor Jackson and Robert Caro were friends, even living near each other in the Bronx at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Jackson was with Caro when the news of Robert Moses's death broke; Caro received a telephone call at a restaurant where they were dining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:32">[01:12:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>.
Their friendship later strained after Jackson publicly stated at a Hofstra University conference on Moses that *The Power Broker*, while the best book he'd ever read, contained numerous errors. *The New York Times* reported only the criticism, which Caro read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:07">[01:22:07]</a>.

## Enduring Impact

Despite its flaws, *The Power Broker* remains a highly influential work that shaped the dominant narrative of Robert Moses. Professor Jackson anticipates that Moses's legacy will continue to be reinterpreted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>. The book's portrayal of Moses as a figure who accomplished immense feats through often ruthless and undemocratic means continues to fuel debate about power, urban development, and the public good. The title of a review for a new play about Moses, "New Yorkers love to hate Robert Moses," encapsulates the complex and often negative perception largely cemented by Caro's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

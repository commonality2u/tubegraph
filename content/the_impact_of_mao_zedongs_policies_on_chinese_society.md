Jung Chang, author of the critically acclaimed "Wild Swans" [[jung_changs_personal_experiences_during_the_cultural_revolution_and_great_famine]] and "Mao: The Unknown Story", provides a firsthand account of life under Mao Zedong's rule. Her works serve as powerful indictments of the regime, detailing the profound and often devastating impact of Mao's policies on the Chinese populace [[the_great_leap_forward_and_the_cultural_revolution]].

## Early Life and the Pre-Cultural Revolution Period

Born in Sichuan in 1952, Jung Chang experienced a privileged childhood as the daughter of high-ranking Communist officials. Her family lived in a compound with amenities such as servants, cars, and drivers, reflecting the class-ridden nature of society even under Communist rule. This privileged existence starkly contrasted with the hardships that would later befall her family and the nation.

## The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)

Launched by Mao in 1966, the Cultural Revolution was described by Chang as his "Great Purge". It was a period of intense social and political upheaval.

### Origins and Mao's Motivations
The Cultural Revolution was, in part, Mao's retaliation against Liu Shaoqi and other party officials who had challenged his policies following the disastrous Great Leap Forward [[mao_zedong_as_a_military_and_political_leader]], [[maos_rise_to_power_and_his_impact_on_china]]. Mao was furious at being "ambushed" by Liu Shaoqi at a 1962 party conference where his famine-inducing policies were halted. The purge was a calculated move to punish these individuals and reassert his absolute authority.

### Impact on Individuals and Families
Chang's own family suffered immensely:
*   **Her Father:** Spoke out against Mao's policies and was subsequently arrested, tortured, driven insane, exiled to a camp, and died prematurely. His criticism was often voiced by writing letters to Mao, theoretically a permitted way for a party member to express dissent.
*   **Her Mother:** Refused to denounce her husband despite tremendous pressure. She endured over 100 denunciation meetings, was made to kneel on broken glass, and was paraded through streets where children spat and threw stones at her.
*   **Jung Chang:** Her family was scattered, and she was exiled to the edge of the Himalayas. She worked as a peasant, a "barefoot doctor" (a doctor with no training, as Mao had declared, "the more books you read, the more stupid you become"), and later as an electrician (also without training, receiving five electric shocks in one month).

### Societal Devastation
*   **Education and Culture:** Schools were closed, and books were burned. China became a "cultural desert" for ten years, with no books, cinemas, theaters, or museums. Many cinemas and theaters were repurposed as prisons and torture chambers; Chang's mother was imprisoned in one. Writers were condemned, sent to gulags, driven to suicide, or executed. Chang herself had to destroy her first poem to avoid trouble during a Red Guard raid.
*   **Methods of Control:** Mao utilized the violent and sadistic tendencies of young people, the Red Guards, to create terror and chaos. These Red Guards were later dispersed and sometimes purged themselves. Denunciation meetings were common, where victims were publicly humiliated and abused. Teachers were among the first targets, used to incite the Red Guards' violence. The army, under figures like Lin Biao, remained firmly in Mao's control, ensuring his power [[maos_strategies_and_theories_of_warfare]].

## The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962)

Mao's ambition was to rapidly transform China into an industrial superpower capable of dominating the world. This involved purchasing military-industrial technology, primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe.

### Policies and Methods
*   **Food Export and Collectivization:** Lacking funds, Mao exported vast quantities of food, despite China's historical status as a food importer. Collectivization through communes was implemented to control the peasantry and facilitate food seizure.
*   **Backyard Furnaces:** To boost steel production, the entire population, including schoolchildren, was mobilized to create steel in backyard furnaces. This led to massive deforestation for fuel and produced mostly useless metal. Peasants were distracted from harvesting crops, which sometimes rotted in fields.
*   **Sparrowcide Campaign:** Mao ordered the extermination of sparrows, believing they ate too much grain. This ecological disruption led to an increase in insect pests.

### Consequences: The Great Famine
These policies directly led to the Great Famine, resulting in an estimated 40 million deaths.
*   Jung Chang recounted her family's maid, whose entire family perished from starvation.
*   Her father witnessed horrific starvation in villages and suffered from edema himself.
*   Even privileged families like Chang's faced food shortages, resorting to consuming seeds grown in urine for nutrition.
Mao was aware of the starvation but callously remarked on death being a "good thing" to harden officials for food confiscation. Liu Shaoqi's eventual opposition to Mao was solidified after witnessing the famine's devastation in his own village.

## Mechanisms of Mao's Rule

### Psychological Control
*   **Indoctrination and Isolation:** Society was subjected to intense brainwashing, with Mao elevated to a god-like status (e.g., "I swear to Chairman Mao" to affirm truth). China was completely isolated from alternative information and the outside world [[the_psychological_manipulation_and_indoctrination_in_totalitarian_regimes]]. Even parents feared telling their children anything contrary to the party line. It took Chang eight years from her initial doubts about society to realize Mao's responsibility.
*   **Terror and Fear:** An atmosphere of intense terror suppressed any unorthodox thoughts, with questioning Mao being the gravest offense.
*   **Self-Criticism and Denunciation:** Regular criticism and self-criticism meetings were mandatory. These were psychological weapons used to break individuals, humiliate them, and turn people against each other, preventing organized opposition. "Warm feelingism" (affection for family) was discouraged. Quota systems, like identifying 5% of a department as "rightists," forced officials to incriminate innocents.

### Organizational Control
*   **The Communist Party Structure:** Totalitarian control extended to the grassroots through layers of party organizations, a level of control unprecedented by previous emperors or rulers like Chiang Kai-shek.
*   **Communes:** These organizations controlled every aspect of peasant life, including food allocation, travel permits, and marriage. They were instrumental in preventing peasants from fleeing during the famine and controlled China's 500 million peasants through a few tens of thousands of units.

## Mao's Pragmatism and Ideology

Chang argues that Mao was highly pragmatic and used Communist ideology when it suited his goals. He joined the party not out of passionate belief but because it offered a livelihood. Collectivization, for instance, was ideologically framed but practically served Mao's need to control and extract food from the peasantry. Mao himself acknowledged in 1923 that Communism would likely need to be brought to China by the Russian Red Army, not organically adopted by the Chinese people.

## Post-Mao Era and Legacy

### Deng Xiaoping's Reforms and Dilemma
After Mao's death in 1976, Deng Xiaoping, himself a victim of Mao's purges (his son was crippled during the Cultural Revolution), came to power. While he initiated economic reforms that led to China's opening up, he chose not to fully denounce Mao [[comparisons_of_different_regimes_and_the_global_impact_of_maos_policies]]. Chang suggests this was likely due to a fear that a full repudiation of Mao would lead to the collapse of Communist Party rule, similar to what happened in the Soviet Union under Gorbachev.

### Continued Veneration and Suppression of History
Mao's portrait still hangs in Tiananmen Square, and the regime continues to derive legitimacy from him. This is attributed to ongoing regime promotion, fading memories of suffering, a lack of alternative belief systems, and the vested interests of the elite who benefit from Communist rule [[international_perceptions_of_maos_china_and_western_misunderstandings]]. Under Xi Jinping, there has been a "total clampdown" on historical narratives that criticize Mao or the Party, including banning books like Chang's. Many parents who experienced Mao's era do not share their experiences with their children due to pragmatism and fear, leading to new generations growing up with a sanitized version of history.

## Western Perceptions
Chang notes that some Western academics and intellectuals held illusions about Mao's regime, sometimes defending it or seeking excuses, possibly driven by a desire for an alternative to Western capitalism. She criticizes figures like Henry Kissinger for being "fascinated with power" and eulogizing Mao. She also clarifies that Nixon and Kissinger did not "open up" China; the minor relaxations of that period were more due to internal power shifts like the fall of Lin Biao.

The policies enacted under Mao Zedong resulted in widespread suffering, societal destruction, and millions of deaths, leaving an indelible mark on Chinese society that continues to be felt and debated today.

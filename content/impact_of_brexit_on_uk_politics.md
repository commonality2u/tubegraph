Dominic Cummings, who "masterminded the Brexit campaign" [00:00:57], provided insights into the impact of Brexit on UK politics, particularly focusing on its role as a catalyst for potential change, electoral dynamics, and the reactions of the political establishment.

## Brexit as an Electoral and Campaigning Force

Brexit significantly influenced the UK's electoral landscape and campaigning strategies.

### The 2016 Referendum Campaign
Cummings stated that the Vote Leave campaign won the 2016 referendum because "we focused on the voters, and the remain campaign didn't" [01:34:33]. He contrasted his team's approach with the political establishment, which he believes failed to understand or address voter concerns.

### The 2019 General Election
The 2019 general election victory for the Conservative Party, which resulted in an 80-seat majority, was "partly by running against the previous decade of the Conservative Party" [00:08:33] and was engineered based on campaigning on issues including Brexit [00:39:33]. Cummings highlighted that their success in 2019 came from doing "very, very obvious things, actually focused on voters outside London," which led to the established parties making "all the same mistakes again" [01:35:53].

## Impact on Political Establishment and Dynamics

Brexit exposed and influenced the workings of the UK's political establishment.

### Establishment's Reaction to Referendum
Following the 2016 referendum, Cummings asserted that the establishment, instead of analyzing their loss despite controlling "all the money... all these institutions... everything with power in the country," chose to create "a whole conspiracy about Putin, Trump, Facebook, everything else as an excuse not to face the reality" [01:35:21].

### Shift in Negotiating Power
During the Brexit negotiations, traditional roles were upended. Cummings noted, "If you look at Brexit, the foreign secretary was almost completely irrelevant to all of the Brexit negotiations" [00:45:07]. Instead, figures like the Prime Minister's private secretary, such as Jono Evans, became far more important despite being "totally unknown in the media" [00:45:12], [00:47:24].

## Brexit as a Catalyst for Broader Political Change

Cummings viewed Brexit as a significant event that offered a rare chance for fundamental political and governmental reform.

### Mandate for Reform
Brexit, alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, was described as the "biggest crisis the state Britain has faced since Hitler in 1945" [00:36:54]. This context, coupled with the "Vote Leave team in Number 10 who've said before they arrived here they're going to change civil service," was seen as a clear mandate for major reforms [00:36:54].

### A "Missed Opportunity" for Transformation
The period following the referendum and the 2019 election was described as an "incredible missed opportunity" [01:51:45]. Cummings believed the "chaos that that created" and the "collapse of both the old parties in 2019" provided a unique moment where "we could actually then transform one of the old parties into the new thing that we wanted to build" [01:51:45]. This notion aligns with the [[impact_of_technological_change_on_politics | impact of technological change on politics]], as significant political transformations often coincide with technological and societal shifts.

### Resistance and Desire for "Normality"
However, there was significant resistance to embracing this transformative potential. Many in politics, including within the Conservative Party, expressed a desire to "go back to normal" and avoid "all these arguments about Brexit" [00:38:28]. This preference for stability over disruption hindered efforts to enact deep-seated changes promised by the Brexit mandate.

## Campaign Messaging and Motivations
Cummings touched upon the distinction between public campaign messaging for Brexit and potentially deeper, underlying motivations. He suggested that the reasons advertised by Vote Leave might differ from the broader goal of addressing governmental dysfunction [01:54:01], [01:54:11]. He acknowledged that "any kind of mass communication always involves huge simplification and huge focus" and that the "vast majority of what you're thinking about... are not going to be the focus of public communications" [01:54:31]. This strategy can be compared to the [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | implications of open-source AI models]], where underlying complexities are often simplified for broader communication and application.

[[Trendfollowing Strategies | Systematic trend following strategies]] involve a disciplined approach to investing, relying on objective information and predetermined systems rather than discretionary decisions. This method, often associated with managed futures, has unique characteristics that investors sometimes misunderstand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>.

## Investor Perceptions and Misunderstandings

In 2014, many investors did not appreciate [[systematic_trend_following_strategies_and_performance | systematic trend following strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:05">[01:46:05]</a>. A primary complaint from investors is the lack of stock exposure in these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Fund managers believe CTAs made a mistake by not offering stock-only funds or incorporating a significant equity component (e.g., 25-30%) in their diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

Another common misunderstanding stems from investors' desire for complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. They expect managers to constantly conduct research and improve systems, similar to how gadgets evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. However, adding too many variables or trying to overly optimize systems can make them weaker and less robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This often results in a smaller sample size of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

Furthermore, investors often don't fully grasp the value of a hedge fund or CTA, which is the use of a trailing stop to preserve capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. In bull markets, this capital preservation aspect is not perceived as necessary, leading to a lack of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Risk Parity and Position Sizing
The concept of "risk parity," popularized by managers like Ray Dalio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, is seen as another name for what [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] has always done regarding position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Position sizing is often underestimated by investors, who tend to focus too much on trade entries and exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. The money management and position sizing of CTAs are considered "wonderful" and fit with various portfolio types, including stocks, stocks and bonds, or more diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Core Principles and Benefits

### Discipline and Consistency
A cornerstone of [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic and trendfollowing investment approaches]] is unwavering discipline and consistency in applying systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This is more crucial than creating "better" systems; even a substandard system, when followed consistently, performs better than one that is constantly guessed or tinkered with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

Drawing from the "Turtle program," a key lesson is to "do the right thing" and follow the systems, even if it leads to a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. Breaking rules, even if profitable, is not acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

### The Role of Drawdowns
Drawdowns are an inherent part of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]]. Managers are encouraged to view volatility on profitable trades not as a loss of capital, but as part of the process of making significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:11:00">[23:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:06:00">[24:06:00]</a>. Attempting to prevent drawdowns by tightening stops or adding complex filters tends to lessen the sample size of trades and weaken the systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:18:00">[24:18:00]</a>. A winning system needs to be difficult and will include losing trades and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:15:00">[44:15:00]</a>.

### Diversification
Diversification is universally beneficial in [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | systematic investing and trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>. It allows for the accumulation of a necessary sample size of trades across various markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. Even if markets become highly correlated, diversification still mitigates the severity of drawdowns compared to less diversified portfolios like stock-only funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Trend Following Strategies

The market environment has shifted, necessitating an evolution in [[trend_following_strategy_and_its_evolution | trend following strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. Shorter-term [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] ceased to be effective in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. Successful [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] now requires a longer-term approach, tolerating larger drawdowns, and having exits further away (e.g., using 150-day or 200-day moving averages instead of 50-day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. This allows managers to stay in choppy markets that may hit short-term lows before resuming their long-term trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>. Multiple exits are crucial to manage risk and preserve capital during market reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.

The increased number of [[trend_following_strategies | trend followers]] and computer-driven trading has made markets progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>. This environment favors managers with the resilience to endure larger drawdowns and resist client pressure to cut profits short or reduce volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

## Industry Challenges and Missed Opportunities

The [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] industry has, in some ways, "shot themselves in the foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Factors contributing to this include:
*   Excessive leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>
*   High fees and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>
*   Lack of a meaningful equity component in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>

The marketing strategy of positioning [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] as an enhancement to traditional investments (improving risk without harming returns) has failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. These strategies should stand alone as worthwhile investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

Many successful CTA firms, including those run by original "Turtles" (students of Richard Dennis), are not the largest in the industry despite long, strong track records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. This is partly attributed to other firms doing a better job of building larger, more institutional-quality organizations with more staff, making them more comfortable for institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:55:00">[29:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>. Historically, the CTA industry was US-dominated, but in the last decade, European managers have seen enormous growth and become powerhouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:00">[30:54:00]</a>.

A significant missed opportunity is the failure of [[trend_following_strategies | trend followers]] to apply their methodologies to the stock market, where [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | momentum trading]] has gained billions in assets and positive press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:48:00">[58:48:00]</a>. [[Trend following strategies | Trend following]] is considered superior to momentum trading but is largely absent from discussions in the stock world, being synonymous instead with "managed futures" that trade flat-lining commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>.

## Key Learnings for a Great Trader

To achieve a long and successful career in trading, particularly in [[systematic_trend_following_strategies_and_performance | systematic trend following]], key traits and learnings include:

*   **Commitment to a [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic approach]]**: Utilize objective information and stick to the chosen method, resisting external influences or internal doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid over-optimization**: "Good enough should be good enough." Trying to perfect systems often leads to problems with sample size and optimization, making them less robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace inherent system characteristics**: Understand that losing trades and drawdowns are an unavoidable part of a winning system. Seeking ease, comfort, and pleasure in trading is often "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:22:00">[44:22:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term perspective**: Play for the long term, offering clients a good product and system with reasonable leverage and expenses. Grow slowly and learn from mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of entries**: While exits are crucial, not taking trades (especially on the entry side) due to fear of losses or over-filtering, is a significant failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:00">[48:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:07:00">[49:07:00]</a>. Filters, while seemingly beneficial, can lead to missing the "biggest trade of all time" if they prevent entry when an unusual setup occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:53:00">[51:53:00]</a>.
*   **Trust the system**: Have confidence and faith in the system that analysis shows will produce profits, and commit to executing its trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:00">[46:46:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook

The core philosophy of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]]—buying high, selling low, taking small losses, and letting profits run—is considered powerful enough to overcome minor methodological flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>. It is a systematic approach proven in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:33:00">[36:33:00]</a>.

Going forward, the industry needs to:
*   **Offer more diverse products**: Specifically, dedicated stock [[trend_following_strategies | trend following funds]] that aim to outperform indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:24:00">[57:24:00]</a>.
*   **Redefine [[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]]**: It should not be exclusively linked to [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] or commodity trading, but rather as an approach applicable to any market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:21:00">[58:21:00]</a>.
*   **Emphasize price action**: The ability to predict market fundamentals, wars, or weather is impossible; [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] thrives by simply reacting to price movements, reflecting "crowd sourcing" of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.

The essential question remains whether it's possible for people to predict the future of markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>. Since the answer is generally no, [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] offers a robust solution by continuously adapting to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. The legacy of programs like the Turtle program lies in the fundamental lesson of sticking to what is known to be right and hard, rather than giving in to external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:44">[03:48:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

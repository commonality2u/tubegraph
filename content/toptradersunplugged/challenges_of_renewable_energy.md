Despite public perception, the decline in oil and gas prices over the past decade has acted as a significant headwind for wind and solar energy, rather than an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While many investors believed that rising energy prices would make wind and solar more competitive and increase adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, the opposite has occurred. Write-offs of wind and solar assets are now being observed because manufacturers are struggling to produce these assets amid the current [[current_energy_crisis_origins_and_impacts | energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Distortive Effects of ESG Policies

The ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement over the last decade has had a "huge distortive effect of capital" in the US and especially in Europe, where many funds have explicit mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This has curtailed and constrained capital into traditional energy industries like oil, gas, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Capital budgets in these sectors have sometimes been down by as much as 70% from pre-COVID levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Even with oil prices rising significantly, from negative in April 2020 to $100 a barrel, many traditional energy companies are not increasing drilling budgets due to ongoing ESG pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

This situation would be less problematic if [[sustainability_and_challenges_in_renewable_energy_investments | renewable energy]] sources like wind, solar, and electric vehicles could consistently provide a huge amount of baseload, uninterruptible power at very efficient rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. However, this is not the case, leading to a "full-blown [[global_energy_crisis_and_supply_chain_issues | energy crisis]]" where traditional companies lack the latitude to invest in their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI)

A crucial concept for understanding energy efficiency is [[natural_resources_and_energy_markets | Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. This metric measures the ratio of usable energy produced by an energy system to the energy consumed to produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Historically, human progress has been tied to increasing EROEI:
*   For 16 centuries (up to around 1650 AD), energy economies based on food, feed, and wood had an EROEI of 5-10:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This provided little to no surplus energy for growth, resulting in stagnant GDP, population, and energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   The shift to coal in the UK around 1650, which had an initial EROEI of about 15:1 (today around 30:1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, created significant energy surplus, leading to an explosion in growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   Modern fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) have an EROEI of approximately 30:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, which enabled the modern world and exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

### Low EROEI of Wind and Solar

[[sustainability_and_challenges_in_renewable_energy_investments | Renewable energy]] sources like wind and solar currently exhibit a very low EROEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>:
*   **Wind:** Between 5-10:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
*   **Solar:** Between 1-5:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:19">[00:28:19]</a>.

These numbers are problematic because an EROEI in this range, historically, leaves no surplus energy for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. Shifting to these sources would require diverting a huge amount of energy to simply *make more energy*, leading to a significant one-time hit to quality of life and severely limiting future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.

## Technological and Physical Limitations

The belief that wind and solar costs will continue to fall indefinitely, similar to Moore's Law, is a "huge misconception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>. While the levelized cost of electricity from wind and solar units has fallen dramatically (75-80%) over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, this trend is reaching physical and chemical limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

The cost reductions observed were primarily driven by two unique factors of the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>:
1.  **Lowest Cost of Capital:** Interest rates were at their lowest in 4,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>.
2.  **Cheapest Energy:** Prices of all forms of energy (gas, oil, coal, uranium) fell by about 90% from peak to trough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

Manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels requires significant capital and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. For example, a single shale well in the Permian Basin can generate the same amount of usable energy over its lifetime as ten 300-foot tall windmills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. The materials and processes involved in renewables are incredibly energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. With both the cost of capital and energy now rising, the future cost of manufacturing these energy-intensive assets is unlikely to decrease and may even increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

### Intermittency and Redundancy

Wind and solar are intermittent sources, meaning they don't produce power consistently (the sun doesn't shine at night, the wind doesn't always blow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Addressing this requires significant redundancies:
*   **Building Excess Capacity:** The cheapest way to deal with short-term variability is to build huge redundancies, like two windmills instead of one, placed far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.
*   **Battery Backup:** Batteries (like lithium-ion) are needed to manage day-to-night fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. However, battery manufacturing is very energy-intensive; almost half the energy consumed by an electric vehicle over its life is embedded in the battery itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Seasonal Variability:** No effective battery solutions exist for long-duration seasonal variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

When these redundancies and backup systems are factored in, the effective EROEI for wind and solar drops significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

## Environmental Trade-offs: "Greens vs. Greens"

A new type of debate is emerging in the renewable energy sector: "greens versus greens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. This involves climate advocates clashing with nature conservationists, as local communities often resist the installation of large-scale renewable infrastructure, such as 800-foot tall windmills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. For example, in Denmark, only three land-based windmills were set up in an entire year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>.

This highlights significant environmental trade-offs:
*   **Resource Extraction:** Producing batteries for electric vehicles requires significant mining of metals like cobalt, lithium, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>. The extraction and processing of these materials can be highly environmentally destructive.
*   **CO2 Intensive Processing:** For instance, processing nickel laterite to battery-grade nickel is one of the most CO2-intensive processes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Deforestation:** A proposed major new nickel project in Indonesia, crucial for meeting demand for EV batteries, would require clear-cutting dense jungle rainforest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This process would release more CO2 than it would save by putting electric vehicles on the road, as forests are crucial for sequestering carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
*   **Waste Management:** Lithium-ion batteries are "horribly flammable" and eventually end up in toxic landfills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.

These internal debates among environmental groups force a more "honest assessment" of whether these technologies truly work as solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

## Malinvestment and Future Outlook

The period of cheap money and cheap energy over the last decade has led to "malinvestment" in energy, favoring highly energy-intensive and capital-intensive ventures that don't necessarily offer high energy returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

Ultimately, capital needs to return to the oil and gas business to address the current supply shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. Investment in new hydrocarbon basins is critical, especially given that new major shale basins like the Permian or Marcellus are unlikely to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:26">[00:40:26]</a>.

In the long term, the ideal energy solution would be one that is both highly efficient (high EROEI) and does not generate carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. Nuclear power fits this description, with an EROEI of 100:1 compared to 30:1 for hydrocarbons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. Recent developments suggest a more frank and honest discussion about [[potential_of_nuclear_energy_and_new_technologies | nuclear power]] is emerging, with Europe adding it to its green taxonomy and ambitious new programs in France, the UK, China, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

The [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures industry]] has a rich history, influenced by seminal experiments and evolving strategies. Jerry Parker, founder and president of Chesapeake Capital, who was part of Richard Dennis's famous Turtle program in 1983, offers a unique perspective on the industry's development, its core philosophies, and the ongoing [[challenges_and_trends_in_the_cta_and_managed_futures_industry | challenges and trends]]. His firm, Chesapeake, which began in February 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:36:00">[31:36:00]</a>, became one of the largest CTAs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:48:00">[52:48:00]</a>.

## The Turtle Program: A Foundational Success
Richard Dennis's Turtle program, started in 1983, was a pivotal moment for [[managed_futures_industry_history | managed futures industry history]] and [[managed_futures_industry_and_trend_following | trend following]]. The program aimed to train individuals in Dennis's proprietary trading concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Parker, elected as part of the first class in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> and hired in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>, was often described as the most successful Turtle ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

The training, lasting two to three weeks, focused on the philosophy of trading systems and [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. Key concepts taught included:
*   A mindset for approaching markets, recognizing that markets change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.
*   Specific entry and exit signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.
*   The importance of taking small losses, letting winners run, [[diversification_in_futures_markets | diversification]], and risk control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.
*   Traders were evaluated on their adherence to the systems, not solely on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>. This supportive atmosphere, where their "client" (Richard Dennis) believed in the systems, was crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

Parker noted that while the initial concepts made sense, pulling the trigger on trades and the fear of losing money were initial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. He also found it challenging to not exit trades too quickly, emphasizing the system's guidance to "hang in there a lot longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.

> "A Trader should love to take losses. It's true because taking losses is part of your system and you love your system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategy Post-Turtle Program
After the Turtle program concluded in early 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>, Parker started Chesapeake Capital. Initially, he traded with lower leverage and risk compared to the Turtle program's aggressive 150-200% annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>. He aimed for about 20% annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:00">[36:48:00]</a>.

Parker's firm focused on continuous evolution, hiring researchers and programmers from the beginning to analyze markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:00">[40:15:00]</a>. Key areas of focus for his firm's [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] included:
*   **Holding Period:** Expanding the holding period was the most important aspect of his strategy's evolution, especially with market choppiness and increased trend followers and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** Parker has always been very focused on [[diversification_in_futures_markets | diversification]], adding markets rapidly, including non-US markets and single stock futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:54:00">[41:54:00]</a>. This means trading as many markets as possible and spreading risk among them, even if correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:12:00">[42:12:00]</a>.

Parker emphasized that he was never interested in adding counter-trend or mean-reversion components to his pure [[managed_futures_industry_and_trend_following | trend following]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:45:00">[43:45:00]</a>. He believes in the robustness of the original system philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and opportunities in the managed futures space | Challenges and Opportunities in the Managed Futures Space]]
Parker highlighted several [[challenges_and_trends_in_the_cta_and_managed_futures_industry | challenges and trends]] in the [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures industry]]:

*   **Client Expectations vs. System Characteristics:** While traders might love their systems, clients often don't love the inherent characteristics like less than 50% winning trades, many small losses, big profits turning into small profits, and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:07:00">[26:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>.
*   **Pressure to Optimize and Minimize Drawdowns:** There's a constant temptation to reduce drawdowns and capture profits more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>. However, adding complexity to systems by trying to minimize drawdowns often gets rid of "some of the good parts also" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:31:00">[47:31:00]</a>. This often involves cutting profits short, which, in the long run, may not be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:00">[55:36:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage and Fees:** Parker admitted that some CTAs, including Chesapeake at times, "mishandled" the great approach of trend following through too much leverage, leading to poor client experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:00">[51:50:00]</a>. High fees and commissions also contribute to problems in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20:00">[52:20:00]</a>.
*   **Market Environment:** The period from 2010-2014 was particularly challenging, especially for commodity markets where Chesapeake had 40-50% of its risk exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:52:00">[59:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. When markets don't trend, [[managed_futures_industry_and_trend_following | trend following]] strategies will naturally struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>.

### The "Least Risky" Strategy
Despite the perceived volatility, Parker strongly believes that [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is the least risky investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:04:00">[49:04:00]</a>. This stems from its core components:
*   **Diversification:** Trading many different markets (shorts and longs) reduces concentration risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:56:00">[49:56:00]</a>.
*   **Systematic Approach:** Rules are backtested to ensure they work, with thousands of trades in the sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:14:00">[50:14:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Nature:** While shorter-term trading might reduce pain, being long-term is necessary to capture significant trends and avoid whipsaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:39:00">[50:39:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Control:** Taking small losses, letting profits run, using trailing stops, and focusing only on market prices are fundamental elements of a good risk-controlled approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13:00">[51:13:00]</a>.

Parker emphasized the importance of an "optimal loss" â€“ a stop-loss placement that balances being too small (leading to whipsaws and low winning percentages) and too large (leading to excessive losses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Evaluating Managers and Track Records
While historical track records are important, especially their longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>, Parker cautions against trying to pinpoint the absolute "top five" managers for future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. He suggests that most CTAs using [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following systems]] ultimately make similar amounts of money over long periods (10-20 years), despite short-term fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. He notes that "bad ideas can seem to work for a long period of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:45:00">[54:45:00]</a>, but eventually, true robustness proves itself.

The biggest complaint from people about [[managed_futures_industry_and_trend_following | systematic trend following strategies]] is often a lack of understanding regarding their inherent characteristics and long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

Quest Partners, a firm founded by Nicolai Kagan, emphasizes a diversified approach to investment management, offering various product types and strategies to find solutions for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, rather than being a purist in one particular strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Evolution and Strategy Diversification

Initially, Quest Partners' assets grew to a peak of approximately $650 million by 2007, largely due to an agreement with a large CTA fund of funds that allocated about $550 million to Quest's strategies from 2003 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. After this large client redeemed their assets in 2010 due to their own complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, Quest Partners had to develop new strategies out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This was driven by a market environment where people were de-allocating from CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, and there were issues concerning fees and the relationship between CTAs and equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Current Portfolio Diversification

As of the recording, Quest Partners manages about $760 million in total assets under management (AUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This AUM is diversified across multiple programs:
*   Traditional CTA strategies: Approximately $80 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>
*   Replicator (seeking to deliver returns of CTA peers): Approximately $80 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>
*   Hedged products:
    *   Equity hedge: Around $450 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>
    *   Fixed income hedge: Around $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>
*   Equity long: Not specified in AUM, but mentioned as an offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>

In total, Quest Partners offers about six different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. The majority of their current assets are in these newer strategies, developed out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

## Differentiating from Industry Trends

Nicolai Kagan highlights concerns about the increasing correlation between alternative strategies and traditional asset classes, particularly equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. He argues that many large hedge funds, particularly CTAs, have introduced factors that reduce their ability to hedge equity corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

> [!warning] Perceived Skill vs. Factor Exposure
> A key concern raised is that investors may be perceiving skill or "Alpha" from managers, when in reality, the returns are often due to exposure to easily replicable factors or increased [[Diversification and risk management in investment portfolios | tail risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. Nicolai states that "Alpha does not equal skill Alpha sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

Kagan identifies several factors that have significantly improved the Sharpe ratio of typical CTA models without involving true skill:
1.  **Sector Optimization:** Increasing allocation to fixed income, which has performed well and is liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This can improve Sharpe ratio by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a> and has provided substantial returns during equity corrections due to its negative correlation with stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.
2.  **Long vs. Short Bias:** Over 90% of returns from basic CTA strategies come from the long side, with short trades making almost no money over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. Trading only longs can improve Sharpe ratio by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
3.  **Time Frame Extension:** CTAs have increasingly used longer time frames for their models (e.g., 10-day to 500-day moving average), which has shown significant uninterrupted upward trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. Optimizing with these longer time frames can improve Sharpe ratio by 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.
4.  **Mean Reversion (Buying Dips):** Strategies that sell rallies and buy dips within a trend, especially in financials, have generated high Sharpe ratios (e.g., 1.2) without skill, particularly in today's central bank-driven, liquidity-rich environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. This can improve Sharpe ratio by 130% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
5.  **Fixed Long Equity Exposure:** Large CTAs (the "btop" or top 50%) show a 70% rolling correlation to the S&P for their residual returns (after removing the trend following component) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Adding a fixed long position in the S&P can improve Sharpe ratio by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
6.  **Short Volatility (Short VIX):** Shorting the VIX, which is equivalent to being short puts, can improve Sharpe ratio by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.
7.  **Carry Models and Credit Strategies:** Typical carry models and exposure to credit-type strategies (like credit swaps) can improve Sharpe ratios by 18% and 80% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

These factors, while improving numerical performance, tend to reduce the ability of CTAs to hedge equity corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>, leading to an [[Investment Strategy Divergence | investment strategy divergence]] from their original purpose.

## Quest Partners' Approach to Diversification

Quest Partners operates with a "Clarity of Direction" and purpose, which allows them to run multiple strategies with a relatively small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Their philosophy in their original program has always been to be a trend follower, correlating to CTA indices, but generating significant Alpha from positively skewed sources of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

> [!info] Positive Skew for Stability
> Quest Partners avoids negatively skewed sources of alpha (like mean reversion, being exposed to risk-on trades, higher fixed income allocation, long equities, shorting VIX, carry, or credit spreads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. They believe that positively skewed sources of alpha are more stable when the market regime changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. This strategy aims to maximize alpha per unit of beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

Their strategies are designed to:
*   **Focus on Shorter Time Frames:** Their average days per trade is about seven days, which is shorter than the typical CTA, to capture positive skew and benefit from [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | volatility expansion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Volatility Setup over Trend:** They are "not looking for the trend" but rather for the correct volatility setup, expecting alpha to happen quickly when volatility accelerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>. They measure volatility in complex ways, such as independently at market new lows/highs versus in the middle of a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
*   **Time-Constrained Trades:** 75-80% of their trades are time-constrained, meaning they exit after a certain amount of time, as the alpha is no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>.
*   **Universal Model Application:** They apply their models to all markets in their portfolio, emphasizing that not doing so would be an over-optimization within the CTA space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>. They have about five different concepts applied in two or more different time frames, ensuring concepts survive across markets and time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>.

This diversified approach across multiple strategies, coupled with a focus on specific volatility patterns and alpha generation, forms the core of Quest Partners' [[Building a diversified investment portfolio | portfolio diversification and construction]] strategy.

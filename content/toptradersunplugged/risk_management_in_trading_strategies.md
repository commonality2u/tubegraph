[[risk_management_in_trading | Risk management]] is considered the greatest asset within the CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. A sophisticated understanding and effective [[risk_management_in_trading | risk system]] are key value additions that professional managers bring, distinguishing them from simple system implementations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

## The Importance of Risk Management

Even with perfect foresight of a market's future price, a position held over time can incur huge risk due to intermediate price movements, potentially wiping out capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. By actively applying [[risk_management_techniques_in_trading | risk management]] to a trade, the Sharpe ratio of the approach dramatically improves, and drawdowns are reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. This highlights that [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] is the primary value-added component in any trend-following system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. It represents the "art" that a manager adds to a trading strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

> [!TIP] Value Proposition
> A manager's ability to communicate their strategy, how they deliver value, and how they appropriately handle [[understanding_and_managing_trading_risks | risk]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Risk Management in Trading

### Dynamic Risk Allocation
Understanding how managers adjust their [[risk_management_in_trading | risk allocation]] is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. The main dangers arise when dynamic leveraging causes positions to grow or accelerate in risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. [[risk_management_in_trading | Risk allocation]] can be conditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>, and assessing whether leverage is a function of past profit and loss (P&L) can provide insights into a manager's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Investors should ask about the granular application of leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.

### Hidden vs. Unhidden Risk
This distinction is crucial for understanding the true nature of risk in trading strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

*   **Unhidden Risks**: These are risks that manifest directly in price movements, such as price risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Trend-following strategies, in particular, primarily expose themselves to price risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.
*   **Hidden Risks**: These risks do not appear in price until they emerge, often inflating Sharpe ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
    *   **Liquidity risk**: Difficult to measure beforehand, only becoming apparent when it occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. While common in some markets, it tends not to be an issue in Futures markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
    *   **Credit risk**: Challenging to estimate credit quality and typically manifests in shocks or unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This is generally not an issue in Futures markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
    *   **Leverage**: While leverage can be transparent, it can also embed hidden risk through methodologies like dynamic leveraging, where risk increases cyclically, potentially not showing up at slower frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. An example is doubling bets when losing, which some systems might do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Option strategies, for instance, apply dynamic leveraging, where the Delta of a call option increases with P&L, increasing leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Impact of Hidden Risks
> Hidden risks are associated with large, infrequent drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Strategies with only price risk, like many systematic trend followers, tend to have more frequent, smaller drawdowns compensated by larger returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>.

### Operational Risk
Operational risk is a significant concern for managers, as evidenced by events like MF Global, which had a negative impact on the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

## Drawdowns and Investor Behavior
Trend-following strategies often experience numerous small drawdowns, unlike equity strategies which may have fewer but larger and longer drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This is because these strategies have exposure to price risk but generally avoid hidden risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

Despite this, recent years (post-2008) have seen larger and longer drawdowns for many trend-following managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Research suggests that the performance of trend-following strategies tends to be depressed following a crisis, similar to a recessionary period where markets restabilize and the market ecology readjusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. The severe nature of the 2008 crisis has prolonged this recovery period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>. However, as correlations have decreased and market issues are being resolved, the strategy appears to be bouncing back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.

Investors often fall into the trap of "trend-following trend followers," buying high and selling low, which is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:29">[00:39:29]</a>. Since risk premia are time-varying and trend-following strategies tend to be mean-reverting over the long run, investors should aim to buy low and sell high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Those who reallocated from high-performing equity markets to CTAs when equity markets were at all-time highs have profited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

The world is witnessing the emergence of a new global order, characterized by significant geopolitical shifts and escalating conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49"></a>. Experts are analyzing these trends to understand the future global macro environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56"></a>.

## Current State of Global Affairs
Simon Hunt, an expert with extensive experience in regions currently challenging the West, offers a unique perspective on the evolving global landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11"></a>. He highlights that a combination of the ongoing war in Europe and a highly leveraged financial system will lead to significant challenges over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49"></a>.

### The War in Europe
The conflict in Ukraine is seen as a proxy war between Russia and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23"></a>. There is a "dangerous intensification" expected in the coming weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13"></a>. By the end of 2022, there is a "real risk" of an "out and out war" between NATO and Russia, potentially spreading beyond Ukraine's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41"></a>. This military intensification will have serious consequences for the global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58"></a>.

### Tensions in Asia: China and Taiwan
Simon Hunt has spent over 20 years traveling extensively in Asia, particularly China, visiting numerous factories and building a network that provides deep insights into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22"></a>. He notes that while China has no desire to invade or blockade Taiwan, there is a risk that America could provoke China by announcing support for a Taiwanese independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03"></a>. This would force China to act, despite preferring a peaceful accommodation between the island and the mainland, aligning with Deng Xiaoping's view of the two parties coming together by 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32"></a>.

If China were compelled to take military action against Taiwan, the global semiconductor industry would be severely impacted. The primary semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, has around 500 suppliers in Taiwan; disruption to even one could halt TSMC's production, affecting America more than China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19"></a>.

Recent U.S. policies aimed at curtailing China's growth, particularly in semiconductors, underscore an ongoing economic war between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01"></a>. However, experts suggest China may have ways around these restrictions, and sophisticated chips could still reach China through back channels, considering that approximately a million Taiwanese work on the mainland and Taiwan has been the biggest investor in China since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54"></a>. Despite political rhetoric, business continues relatively normally between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03"></a>.

### Other [[potential_geopolitical_risks_and_global_conflicts | Geopolitical Risks and Global Conflicts]]
Beyond Europe and Asia, attention should be paid to Syria, as potential developments there could escalate into Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45"></a>. Such expansion could lead to "very dangerous volatile periods for oil prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56"></a>.

## Broader Implications
The world is described as entering a "depression era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21"></a>. This environment, characterized by extreme increases in food prices and the potential for a global depression akin to 1929-1932, is fueled by a confluence of [[global_economic_and_geopolitical_risks | global economic and geopolitical risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37"></a>. The current global financial system, with its high leverage, is expected to experience "pockets of implosions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31"></a>. Central banks are anticipated to be forced to reverse their tightening policies and inject liquidity into the system to prevent these "bombshells from exploding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58"></a>. This shift is predicted to lead to a significant fall in the dollar and a resurgence of inflation, alongside further increases in energy and food prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28"></a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30"></a>.

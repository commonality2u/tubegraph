Global markets are influenced by both [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | secular and cyclical trends]], which determine long-term directional shifts and shorter-term fluctuations, respectively. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for investors, particularly in periods of [[global_macroeconomic_cycles_and_their_influence_on_financial_markets | significant economic change]].

## Defining Market Regimes

A **secular trend** represents a long-term, overarching direction in the market, often lasting for decades. These trends are driven by fundamental shifts in economic policy, demographics, or technology. A **cyclical trend**, in contrast, refers to shorter-term fluctuations that occur within a secular trend, often tied to [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | economic cycles]] or business cycles.

Jim describes the concept of [[current_economic_trends_and_historical_comparisons | regime shifts]] as a change in these [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | secular trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. He highlights that for 40 years, the market experienced a secular trend dominated by Federal Reserve activity and monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. This dominance meant less frequent crises and lower long-term volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:52]</a>. However, the current environment may be transitioning out of this, requiring a focus on both secular and cyclical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

### The "End of an Era"

Many experts agree that 2022 marked the "end of an era" where central banks maintained full control over markets for two prior decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This shift was characterized by the word "unprecedented" being used frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

A core question is whether the "carry regime," defined as a very stable environment where central banks were in full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, has ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Mark's View:** He believes the market is in a "regime transition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. While carry trades typically require dispersion in returns, periods of high volatility necessitate exiting carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, opportunities eventually re-emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Jim's View:** He asserts that the stable carry regime, characterized by a strong positive bias from zero percent interest rates, is "slowing" for the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This is due to a deleveraging process and the rising cost of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, which should reduce the "fat tail" and lead to a flattening skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He distinguishes between deleveraging periods (like 2008, which are fast) and inflationary periods (like the 1970s, which are long and slow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Rob's View:** From an empirical standpoint for carry strategies across futures, recent underperformance (since COVID) is not unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Historical data from the late 1970s showed a much worse period for carry, followed by a 25-30 year bull run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This aligns with globalization and increased market stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Rob questions whether 18 months of data is enough to declare the end of carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Niels's View:** The "carry regime" was more about investors doing well by simply being long stocks and leveraged bonds from 2000 to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Ultimately, there is a consensus that a [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | regime shift]] is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This shift involves the reversal of [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | macro trends]] like declining interest rates, falling inflation rates, and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Isabel Schnabel's term "the great volatility" contrasts with the previous "great moderation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Impact on Investment Strategies

### Trend Following

2022 was an exceptionally strong year for [[trend_following_in_various_markets | Trend Following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This was attributed to:
*   **Strong Trends:** Persistent price action across multiple markets, including bonds, interest rates, and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Favorable Setups:** Particularly in interest rates and bonds, low volatility at the start of the year allowed for meaningful position sizing when signals to go short emerged, leading to volatility expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **The "Grind":** Markets have been "grinding lower and higher" for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. This "Goldilocks environment" where prices move sufficiently but not too quickly, combined with consistent central bank policy changes, [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]], and slowing growth, favors [[trend_following_and_market_cycles | Trend Following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Secular Force:** Jim identifies the "grind" as a [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | secular trend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. The acceleration into a new trend is rapid at the turning point, slowing down over years as the regime shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This initial fast turn is beneficial for trend followers in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.
*   **Slower Unfolding Trends:** Trends unfolded slower in some sectors like interest rates and currencies, benefiting strategies until reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Changing Correlations:** The bond-equity correlation behaved differently than typical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.
*   **Timeframe Performance:** Across various timeframes, from a few weeks to a couple of years, all would have performed well in 2022, even more so than 2008 and 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

### Volatility Strategies and Carry Trades

In 2022, equity volatility and skew underperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This was not a coincidence.

*   **Cyclical Overcrowding:** Cyclically, oversupply of volatility and over-hedging due to crowding into long skew and downside protection after 2020 compressed volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>. This is a cyclical effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **Secular Shifts:** Secularly, a move away from Fed dominance and monetary policy dominance, coupled with higher [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]], historically "kills skew" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. It removes the upside trend and creates a more two-sided market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. The 1960s and 1970s serve as a historical [[comparison_of_current_economic_conditions_to_past_economic_cycles | comparison]], where the market went nowhere for 14 years in nominal terms while real terms declined significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. This implies a future with two-sided volatility and no persistent upside trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Risk Premium:** The secular decline in the effectiveness of some trends due to compressed risk premium is ending, replaced by an acceleration of a new trend that creates new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. Risk premium itself should increase, benefiting CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. The spread between implied and realized volatility is expected to increase due to less liquidity, creating more opportunities in the volatility space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## Lessons Learned in 2022

The events of 2022 reinforced several key lessons:

*   **Humility and Open-mindedness:** Mark concludes that personal forecasts are often poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>, emphasizing the need for humility and reliance on price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. Alan echoes this, noting how quickly things can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>, citing the quote: "Things take longer to happen than you think they will, then they happen faster than you thought they could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
*   **Macro Trends Drive Price Trends:** While individual forecasts might be limited, understanding the macro environment and its influence on [[trend_following_and_market_cycles | price trends]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.
*   **Prediction of Distribution Shape:** Instead of predicting market direction, understanding the "shape of the distribution" of returns and the forces acting upon it is more feasible and profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Major forces, like demographic change and inequality, are driving a mean reversion to a much longer trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>.
*   **Imagining the Unimaginable:** The year served as a reminder to be open to seemingly "crazy" market movements, like negative oil prices, countering the tendency to limit imagination after decades of relative control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

> "We may not be very good about knowing the direction of markets, but we do have sort of good ideas of what may happen if we're in a certain regime. We do know conditionally what might happen if we're in certain environments." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>

The world is currently experiencing a [[current_energy_crisis_origins_and_impacts | full-blown energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This situation is not solely a result of recent geopolitical events but has roots in policies and market dynamics that have unfolded over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

## Origins of the Crisis

### The Distortive Impact of ESG Policies
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment trends over the last decade have significantly distorted capital allocation, particularly in the US and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This movement has curtailed and constrained capital flow into traditional energy industries such as oil, gas, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Capital budgets for these sectors were down by as much as 70% from pre-COVID levels, and while they are starting to rebound, the pace is slow due to persistent ESG pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Many investors mistakenly believe that rising energy prices would make wind and solar more competitive and increase their adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. However, the opposite is occurring: write-offs of wind and solar assets are starting because manufacturers cannot produce them efficiently amidst the current energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Shale Productivity and Supply Challenges
For the past decade, the only major source of oil supply growth in the non-OPEC world has been the United States, primarily from its shale formations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Analysis revealed that the industry's reported productivity gains in shale were not due to better drilling techniques but rather to "high-grading" â€“ drilling the best wells first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. This practice means that high-quality drilling locations would eventually be depleted, leading to a stagnation in production growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated this, as a significant drop in rigs and production made data analysis difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. Post-COVID, well productivity has been flat to declining, indicating that the industry is facing headwinds from falling productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Wind and Solar: Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI)
A key concept in understanding energy systems is the Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI), which measures the usable energy produced relative to the energy consumed to produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

*   **Historical Context:**
    *   For approximately 16 centuries (from 1 AD to 1650 AD), human energy economies relied on food, animal feed, and wood, yielding an EROEI of 5-10:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This low EROEI meant almost no surplus energy, limiting economic growth and population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>.
    *   The shift to coal in the UK around 1650, due to deforestation, increased EROEI, initially to about 15:1, generating surplus capital and spurring significant growth in population, real GDP, and energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.
    *   Modern fossil fuel hydrocarbons (oil and natural gas) have an EROEI of about 30:1, which underpins the modern world's prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

*   **Renewables and EROEI:**
    *   Renewable energy sources like wind and solar have a significantly lower EROEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Intermittency:** The intermittent nature of wind and solar (sun doesn't always shine, wind doesn't always blow) necessitates substantial energy consumption for redundancy and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.
        *   **Redundancy:** Building redundant systems, like two windmills instead of one, is the cheapest short-term solution for variability, but it's very energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:14:00">[26:14:00]</a>.
        *   **Battery Storage:** Lithium-ion batteries, crucial for daily intermittency, are very energy-intensive to mine and manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. For an electric vehicle, almost half the energy consumed over its lifetime is embedded in the battery's production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.
        *   **Seasonal Variability:** There are currently no long-duration batteries capable of handling seasonal energy variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.
    *   When these redundancies and storage requirements are factored in, the EROEI for wind drops to 5-10:1 and for solar to 1-5:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:10:00">[28:10:00]</a>. Such low EROEI levels historically leave no surplus energy for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>.

### Misconceptions about Renewable Costs
The idea that wind and solar costs will continue to fall indefinitely, akin to "Moore's Law," is a significant misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:32:00">[29:32:00]</a>. While the levelized cost of electricity from wind and solar has fallen dramatically (75-80%) over the last decade, this trend is unlikely to continue because it begins to violate laws of physics and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>.

The actual drivers of past cost reductions were two unique factors of the last decade:
1.  The lowest cost of capital in 4,000 years of interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>.
2.  A 90% peak-to-trough fall in the price of all forms of energy (gas, oil, coal, uranium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>.

Manufacturing wind turbines and solar panels is extremely capital and energy intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. For example, one shale well in the Permian Basin can generate the same usable energy as ten 300-foot tall windmills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>. Given that both the cost of capital and energy prices are now rising, it is expected that the costs of manufacturing these energy-intensive assets will increase, not decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.

### Malinvestment and the Need for Reinvestment
The period of [[global_economic_and_financial_challenges | cheap money]] and [[economic_implications_of_deglobalization_and_energy_policies | cheap energy]] led to "malinvestment" in energy-intensive technologies and activities that lack high returns on energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:51:00">[38:51:00]</a>. This includes over-investment in renewables, as well as the proliferation of technologies like cryptocurrencies and aspirations for space travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>.

To resolve the crisis, capital must return to the oil and gas business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:00">[40:15:00]</a>. Decades of attrition and depletion, coupled with a lack of new major discoveries comparable to the Permian or Marcellus shale basins, mean that more investment is desperately needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a>.

## [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | Supply Chain Issues]] and Deglobalization

The [[geopolitical_influences_on_energy_markets | current energy crisis]] was underway before Russia's invasion of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:00">[0:51:00]</a>. The geopolitical shift towards deglobalization exacerbates these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:03:00">[1:03:00]</a>. Companies are moving away from lean, just-in-time supply chains, as highlighted by COVID-19 disruptions, towards more secure, redundant supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:00">[1:06:00]</a>. This need for redundancy extends upstream to raw material supply chains, which will require significant energy and materials to build out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:06:00">[1:06:00]</a>.

Historically, the collapse of the Soviet Union flooded global commodity markets with excess material, contributing to a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:00">[1:07:00]</a>. The current trend of deglobalization is expected to have the opposite effect, creating a tailwind for resource prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:07:00">[1:07:00]</a>.

Furthermore, rising commodity prices and inflation create an incentive to hoard inventory, pulling demand forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:00">[1:08:00]</a>. These dynamics suggest a future characterized by [[potential_food_and_resource_crises | shortages]], leading to a "decade of shortages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:00">[1:09:00]</a>.

## Economic Implications

There's a critical threshold where energy expenditures as a percentage of GDP begin to significantly hinder economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:09:00">[1:09:00]</a>. Historically, for Western economies like the US, around 10% of primary energy expenditure as a percentage of GDP has served as a "dramatic drag" on economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:00">[1:11:00]</a>. Based on current figures, if oil prices reach $150 a barrel, the US would cross this threshold, potentially leading to an economic "stall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:11:00">[1:11:00]</a>. If too much of the economic system's energy is directed towards producing its own fuel, the system stalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:12:00">[1:12:00]</a>.

## [[Future economic challenges and crises | Outlook and Opportunities]]

Despite the current challenges, there is growing optimism around nuclear power as a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>. Nuclear power boasts an EROEI of 100:1, making it vastly more efficient than hydrocarbons (30:1) and renewables (5-10:1 for wind, 1-5:1 for solar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:40:00">[41:40:00]</a>. It also ideally does not generate carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:00">[41:31:00]</a>. Although there have been historical cost overruns and issues with large-scale reactor construction in the West, the emergence of smaller, modular reactor designs and renewed interest from countries like France, the UK, China, and India offer potential for a "step change in energy efficiency" and a period of prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>.

The energy sector, particularly in the S&P 500, remains significantly underweight compared to historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:00">[1:13:00]</a>. While energy stocks have seen substantial gains from their bottoms, they are still far from their historical peaks, indicating potential for continued growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:13:00">[1:13:00]</a>. This period of [[global_economic_and_geopolitical_risks | geopolitical]] and economic shifts represents a new playbook, requiring a reconsideration of approaches to raw materials and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:08:00">[1:08:00]</a>.

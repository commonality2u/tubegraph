[[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | Systematic investing]], particularly [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]], is highlighted as a dependable and consistent investment strategy often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy offers significant [[hedging_strategies_and_portfolio_diversification | diversification benefits]] for portfolios containing traditional stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Key Characteristics and Performance
[[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | Managed futures]], often represented by the SocGen CTA Index, demonstrates unique characteristics that make it a valuable [[hedging_strategies_and_portfolio_diversification | diversifier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>:
*   **Returns**: Over 22 years, it has generated 75% of equity returns and 120% of bond returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Correlation**: It exhibits zero correlation to either stocks or bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   **Drawdowns**: The maximum drawdown over 22 years was 14%, which is less than a third of equities (which saw two 50% drawdowns) and now less than bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.
*   **Performance During Downturns**: [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | Managed futures]] has performed best when 60/40 portfolios (stocks and bonds) performed worst, such as during 2000-2002, 2008, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This counter-cyclical performance makes it a "beacon of green in a sea of red" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.

Compared to other alternatives like private equity and private credit, [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] offers more significant [[hedging_strategies_and_portfolio_diversification | diversification benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Private equity is highly correlated to the equity market, and private credit is correlated to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Given that stocks and bonds are expected to move together for the next 10-20 years due to higher interest rates (above 4% leading to positive correlations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>, the low correlation of [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] becomes even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

## Underutilization and Challenges in Adoption
Despite these benefits, the allocation to [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures]] remains remarkably low. In the US ETF space, it constitutes only 2-3 basis points of the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. In the mutual fund space, it's roughly $25 billion in assets, or about 6% of the overall liquid alternatives market, and just 10 basis points of the total mutual fund market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. A significant portion of advisors (nine out of ten) have no exposure to the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

Reasons for this underutilization and the [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_the_managed_futures_space | challenges]] in the [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures industry]] include:
*   **Historical Frames of Reference**: Some advisors' perceptions are based on outdated experiences, such as the John Henry product in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Perception**: There's a deep-seated suspicion about models, often leading to mischaracterizations of [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] as leveraged, long-short, derivative-based "black box" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Timing**: Investors often try to time the market, expecting to "buy the dip" or wait for the "right time" to invest, which is antithetical to [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.
*   **Narrative Challenges**: The industry needs a clearer and simpler explanation for why [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] works, moving beyond complex heuristics or behavioral biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>.

## Why Managed Futures Works: The Constraint Advantage
The core reason for the effectiveness of [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] lies not primarily in exploiting behavioral biases, but in its ability to operate without the constraints faced by traditional asset managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>.
*   **Slow-Moving Industry**: The asset management industry is designed to move slowly, with advisors acting as "steady hands" and allocators formulating long-term asset allocation assumptions over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. This structure makes rapid adaptation difficult.
*   **Rapid Adaptation**: In contrast, [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] strategies can adapt quickly to regime shifts in markets, moving positions in a matter of weeks or months, rather than the 18 months or two years it might take traditional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. This allows them to capitalize on significant changes that others are too slow to react to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.
*   **Outsourcing Tactical Decisions**: Investing in [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] can be seen as outsourcing the tactical portion of a portfolio to specialists who excel at adapting to market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

This advantage is particularly pronounced during periods of market volatility or crisis, leading to the concept of "Crisis Alpha" (coined by Katy Kaminsky) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

## Fostering Greater Adoption
To increase adoption, the [[managed_futures_industry | industry]] needs to:
*   **Focus on Outcomes**: Emphasize how [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] fits into a portfolio, its objectives, and the overall benefits, rather than getting lost in the technical "nitty-gritty" of model mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>.
*   **Utilize Compelling Narratives**: Employ metaphors that resonate with investors, such as "hurricane insurance" that pays while waiting for the storm, or the ability to "ride market waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>.
*   **Highlight Long-Term Evidence**: Continuously refer to the undeniable evidence from data like the SocGen CTA Index, which covers periods like the dot-com crisis, the GFC, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>. The argument should be that the evidence alone supports its value, even if the "why" isn't fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
*   **Address Misconceptions**: Challenge common misconceptions, such as the idea that the space was "dead" during "The Long Winter" when other investments performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures industry]] has the potential for significant growth, perhaps 5 to 10 times its current size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:58">[01:00:58]</a>. This requires continuous dialogue, improved messaging, and a focus on educating investors about the clear [[diversification_in_futures_markets | diversification benefits]] and unique role of these strategies in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

Recent developments, like the proposed 2x leveraged managed futures ETF (DBMF2x), indicate a push towards different market segments, including those seeking higher capital efficiency or leveraged exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. However, transparency regarding fees and underlying mechanics in such products remains an important consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

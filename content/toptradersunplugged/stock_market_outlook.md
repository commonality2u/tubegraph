Mahendra Sharma, founder of MahendraProphecy Publications and a financial astrologer, provides a unique perspective on market trends, utilizing astro-cycles and a "wave of nature" theory to forecast future movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:28">[02:25:28]</a>. His methodology involves studying planetary movements and their historical correlation with market events, identifying patterns over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. Sharma emphasizes that while astro-charts provide the same data, their interpretation varies among individuals based on their own astro-cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. He aims to use this knowledge to help individuals in the [[Investment Strategies and Market Predictions | financial market]] make informed decisions and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## General Market Direction

Sharma has maintained a consistently bullish outlook on equity markets for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. He previously predicted the Dow Jones would reach 32,000 points, a target nearing reality at the time of the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

He attributes past market performance to a new era of demand and lifestyle changes, suggesting that traditional valuation methods used by economists and analysts are outdated for current market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

> "This is a new era, new world, new demand, new way of the life starting, so forget about the valencians. You have to revise your values, you have to revise the method of the values in the equity market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

### Near-Term Outlook (Next 3 Years)
The [[Global market trends and investment strategies | future prospect of the global equity market]] "still looks fantastic" for at least the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Sharma also indicates a potential Nasdaq target of 25,000 and S&P 500 targets between 5,200 and 7,500 within the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.

### Long-Term Outlook
A significant market shift is anticipated around 2026, where a "huge crash" in the equity market and technology sector may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. This aligns with a predicted "second revolution" in technology, about 30 years from the first in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. This potential downturn is expected to be a "traditional bear market" where values could go lower for "months and months and years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

## Sector-Specific Predictions

### Technology
Technology stocks, which saw a major bubble in the late 1990s and subsequent crash in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, are expected to continue their strong performance. However, investors are advised to be cautious with sharply rising electric car company stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.

### Medical Device Stocks
Medical device stocks are highlighted as a "golden egg" sector, with a "beautiful biggest bull market" expected for the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. This is influenced by Saturn's movement through Capricorn and Aquarius, indicating a highly positive time cycle for this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

### Other Recommended Sectors
Sharma continues to recommend growth areas, technology, and biotech sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

### Tesla
Tesla is expected to continue its upward trajectory, with a target of $800 after its stock split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. This positive outlook is based on both Elon Musk's and Tesla's astrological charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

## [[Global market trends and investment strategies | European Market Outlook]]

The European equity market is expected to follow the US market trend and experience a "big economy recovery" in the next three to three and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>. Investors are advised not to short the European market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

## Market Volatility

Regarding [[Volatility in the SP500 and market trends | volatility]], a "bumpy start" is expected in early 2021, particularly in the first quarter (first five weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. Traders are advised to be cautious and consider a volatility index in their portfolio if holding stocks during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

The era of rapid V-shaped recoveries after sharp market falls is believed to have ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Instead, the market is expected to experience slower, more prolonged periods of stagnation (sideline movement) after the next major bear market, potentially for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>.

## Currency and Interest Rate Outlook

### US Dollar
The US Dollar index is expected to bottom out around 91, with a critical support level at 89.11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. While there will be [[Volatility in the SP500 and market trends | volatility]] and two-way movements, the dollar index is not expected to fall below 89 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

### Euro
Sharma previously predicted a potential crisis for the Euro around 2022-2023, which he has now refined to end of 2024 to 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. This period is seen as critical for the Euro, with potential for a 40-50% loss in value and significant impact on the real estate and bond markets in Europe, potentially affecting the [[Global economic outlook and recession risks | global equity market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>.

### Emerging Market Currencies
Emerging market currencies are expected to perform well, with Mexican Peso and South African Rand already showing strong gains. Brazilian Real is specifically highlighted as a "best currency to invest" in 2021, with potential for 25-30% gains against the dollar, euro, and pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>.

### Interest Rates
After 2024, interest rates are predicted to "go to the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Unusually, this rise in interest rates is expected to coincide with a rise in gold prices, a phenomenon that economists and analysts may find difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. This correlation could suggest a breakdown of trust in traditional financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

## Commodities Outlook

### Energy
Energy markets were negative in 2020 and are expected to remain sluggish in 2021, with oil having difficulty crossing the $50 mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.

### Metals
Metals are expected to perform well in 2021, but with high [[Volatility in the SP500 and market trends | volatility]]. Traders are advised to book profits on sharp rises and buy back on dips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.

### Grains and Soft Commodities
Grains are expected to outperform in 2021, along with certain soft commodities. Specifically, coffee and cocoa are highly recommended for investment, with some weather-related problems noted for Australia and Brazil affecting supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>. Soya bean and wheat are also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

## Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies

Sharma advises caution with Bitcoin investments. While it was near its all-time high, a crucial period between February 20th and 27th, 2021, could see a "drastic fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. If Bitcoin fails to drop during this week and continues to move higher, it could test $45,000-$50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.

However, the "right time" to invest in cryptocurrencies is foreseen from 2026-2028, when many central banks are expected to introduce their own digital currencies, potentially legalizing or integrating them into the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>.

## Gold

Gold is predicted to continue its bullish trend. After bottoming out around $1840, it is expected to reach $2375 in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. Silver is also targeted to reach $38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. Mining stocks are expected to perform well in 2021, and platinum is highlighted as having a "fantastic" outlook for 2021, potentially gaining 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

Looking further ahead, a 52-year gold cycle predicts a "death of gold" or its irrelevance after 2052 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. This could involve government policies restricting gold ownership or gold potentially becoming a currency itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>. A very interesting era for gold, where it plays a key role, is expected to start from 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

## [[Future economic outlook and fiscal challenges | Broader World Events]]

Sharma generally avoids predicting negative world events due to past experiences like the 9/11 attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>. However, he hints that "serious issues" and "a lot of things are happening and coming" to the real world, potentially leading to widespread societal restlessness after 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.

He also foresees "very very dangerous" natural disasters taking place between 2026 and 2030, potentially disturbing the whole world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

### U.S. Politics and Market
Despite avoiding political predictions, Sharma noted that regardless of the [[us_economic_outlook_and_presidential_election_implications | US election outcome]], the market was destined to move higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. He consistently advised investors not to short the market during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.

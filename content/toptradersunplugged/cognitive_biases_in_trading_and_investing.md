Roy Neerhoofer, founder and president of RG Neerhoofer Capital Management, discusses how human nature, particularly inherent [[cognitive_biases_in_trading_decisions | cognitive biases]], impacts trading and investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. His insights stem from his early studies in neuroscience, which explored how the human brain functions and its influence on behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## The Human Brain and Investment Decisions

Neerhoofer highlights that the human brain evolved to solve problems related to survival and reproduction in environments like the African Savannah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. These ingrained behavioral patterns, while crucial for ancestral survival, are often suboptimal for modern financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Following these instincts can lead discretionary traders to encounter significant difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Therefore, individuals must exert considerable effort to avoid falling prey to these [[behavioral_biases_and_investment_strategies | behavioral biases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

### Specific Cognitive Biases in Trading

Several key cognitive biases identified include:

*   **Risk Aversion** Humans tend to "hate to lose more than they love to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This means certain strategies might appear more appealing due to a strong aversion to loss, even if they aren't optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. In a natural state, being risk-averse is smart for gene propagation, such as running from a stalking lion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This bias leads to strategies being favored that incorporate this notion, which may not always be optimal in a comprehensive investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Endowment Bias** People often value something they possess more than something they do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. While useful in a state of nature, this is a known cognitive bias in economics that doesn't hold true in all contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Consensus Bias** There is a natural tendency to "stampede with the herd," making it emotionally challenging to adopt a contrarian stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Recency Bias** Recent information is remembered more vividly and influences decisions disproportionately compared to older, equally relevant information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This is useful in nature where the current environment often predicts the next immediate event, but it is not true in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Visual Pattern Recognition** The human brain is wired to identify patterns, which is beneficial for spotting camouflaged predators in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. However, in financial data, this can lead to seeing patterns that aren't statistically significant, particularly in technical analysis or charting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Neerhoofer's brother, Victor, was a "tremendous opponent" of charting for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Decisions should ideally be based on probabilities rather than perceived visual patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

Neerhoofer concludes that human beings are, by their very nature, "terrible investors" unless significant effort is made to counteract these [[cognitive_biases_in_trading_decisions | cognitive biases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

## Impact on Systematic Trading Strategies

While [[systematic_trading_vs_expert_intuition | systematic trading strategies]] are designed to avoid the emotional responses that lead to suboptimal decisions, such as selling at the worst possible time, the people who create and implement these strategies often still exhibit the same [[behavioral_biases_and_investment_strategies | behavioral biases]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Over-reliance on Recent Performance** Investors and strategy creators tend to overuse recent performance, such as a strategy's Sharpe ratio over the last two years, to decide whether to use or discard a [[philosophies_of_systematic_trading | systematic strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Research has shown that the last two years of Sharpe ratio are "completely unpredictive" of future performance for CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Loss Aversion in Strategy Design** The tendency to "hate to lose more than they love to win" can influence the types of strategies chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. For instance, prop traders with tight loss limits are incentivized to use strategies that generate frequent, smaller profits rather than those that make large amounts of money less frequently but might incur losses for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. This often leads to a "short volatility" approach, where firms themselves can develop a "very big short Vol vulnerability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. This inherent bias is suggested as a reason why many multi-strategy funds suffer significant losses during periods of illiquidity and high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

Neerhoofer's firm specifically designs its strategy to be a true "protective return" by avoiding trend-following and focusing on the short-term space to capture realized volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This aims to counteract common market biases and provide consistent negative correlation to equities and traditional investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. His firm's best years in terms of performance often coincide with periods of market sell-offs, demonstrating its protective nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Overcoming Biases in Firm Culture

To foster a culture that challenges [[cognitive_biases_in_trading_decisions | cognitive biases]] and encourages innovation, Neerhoofer's firm prioritizes:
*   **Scientific Approach** Emphasizing a rigorous scientific approach to data rather than relying on conventional wisdom or "articles of faith" like Elliot wave theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Challenging the Status Quo** Actively encouraging employees not to follow popular trades or the status quo, which helps avoid crowded strategies and potentially provides liquidity to the majority, a beneficial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Diversity and Innovation** Promoting an environment where diverse perspectives and innovation are encouraged, allowing individuals to explore new ideas and approaches, similar to how tech firms allocate time for creative work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Purity** Seeking individuals with intellectual purity who can provide a theoretical counterpoint to existing models, fostering "game-changing ideas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   **Openness and Transparency** Operating with a very open culture where everyone, from researchers to IT and trading staff, can see real-time P&L and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. This transparency builds trust and encourages individuals to ask "dumb questions" and propose better ways of doing things without fear of being "shot down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

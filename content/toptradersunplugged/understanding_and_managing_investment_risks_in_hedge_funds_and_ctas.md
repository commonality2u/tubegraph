Investing in hedge funds and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) involves significant financial [[Investment Strategies and Risks | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Prospective investors should always request and understand the specific [[Investment Strategies and Risks | risks]] associated with any investment product directly from the manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It is crucial to remember that past performance does not guarantee or even infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Investor Perceptions and Misconceptions about Risk

Investors often fail to appreciate the unique aspects of systematic trend-following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A common complaint is the lack of equity exposure in CTA portfolios; it's suggested that CTAs erred by not offering stock-only funds or incorporating a significant equity component (25-30%) into their diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Another misconception is the desire for complexity in managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Investors often believe that continuous research and adding variables to systems will make them better, similar to how consumer gadgets improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. However, adding too many ways to prevent drawdowns can negatively impact profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Furthermore, investors often don't understand the fundamental value of a hedge fund or CTA, which is the trailing stop loss that preserves capital when markets look weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This capital preservation mechanism is often overlooked during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Risk Parity vs. Trend Following

The concept of "risk parity," popularized by successful hedge fund managers like Ray Dalio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, is often perceived as a sophisticated new approach. However, it can be viewed as simply another term for the position sizing and risk management principles inherent in traditional trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Position sizing is a crucial element that investors often underestimate in systematic management, focusing too much on trade entries and exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The money management and position sizing of CTAs are considered wonderful and applicable across various portfolios, from stocks to fully diversified long and short strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

The challenge with risk parity is that it was advocated at the top of the bond market, implying it should be implemented when a trade is initiated, not after a bull market has run for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If CTAs had offered stock-only or stock and bond funds 10 years ago, their performance would likely have negated many objections to trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Managing Investment Risk

### Manager Due Diligence and Questions
When performing manager due diligence, investors should ask about the manager's ability to explain their systems, the underlying theory, and what to expect from the trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The most important question for any systematic trader is about the sample size of trades and how it's counted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A 20-30 year backtest with thousands of trades across different markets and environments provides a robust basis for a systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Adding additional variables or "niceties" to systems to prevent losses or drawdowns can reduce the sample size and weaken the systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. For trend following, eliminating drawdowns or achieving a winning percentage higher than the low 40s can make systems less robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. These critical questions about system robustness are seldom asked by investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### The Role of Discipline and Consistency
A core tenet in [[Risk management in investment firms | risk management in investment firms]] is committing to a systematic approach and objective information, then disciplined execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. Avoiding emotional decisions or "trading by the seat of one's pants" is crucial for preserving capital and participating in significant market moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.

!> **Discipline and Consistency**
"Maintain 100% consistency and discipline in your systems; that is more important than creating better systems." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>

Even with a substandard system, consistently following it is preferable to guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Traders often err by trying to perfect systems, which can lead to over-optimization and issues with sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. "Good enough should be good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Losing trades and drawdowns are an inherent part of a winning system and should not be sought to be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

### Managing Emotions During Drawdowns
Handling emotions during drawdowns is challenging. One method is to stop watching market prices daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. It requires a deep commitment to the systematic process and doing the right thing on every trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Traders are "martyrs," willing to endure pain and stick to a game plan even when it's not performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Computerizing trades and having a division of duties (one group devises systems, another executes trades) provides a strong internal control for a more disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Distinguishing Capital Loss from Profit Volatility
From a trend follower's perspective, "volatility" and "drawdown" on profitable trades are not the same as "risk." Risk is defined by the capital willing to be risked on a specific trade (e.g., 50 basis points) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Traders are conservative about losing initial capital. However, with large open trade profits, like in gold or silver, systems are designed to be more liberal, not getting out to avoid cutting profits short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Trying to tighten stops to preserve profits, outside of the systematic exit, often leads to cutting profits short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Convincing clients to tolerate this profit volatility during good periods is almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

### Evolution of Trend Following: Longer-Term Approach
Over the years, systematic trend following has evolved. Shorter-term trend following stopped working in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. To continue being profitable, managers had to adopt a longer-term approach, tolerating greater drawdowns and having exits further away (e.g., 150-day or 200-day moving averages instead of 50-day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

This shift to longer-term trading means markets are choppier; a trend might hit the 50-day or 75-day low more often, only to reach new highs later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. The downside is that at a market peak, it becomes harder to preserve as much of the maximum profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Multiple exits are mandatory to manage risk; if one exit is triggered, the entire position isn't necessarily closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

This choppiness is attributed to the increasing number of trend followers and computers in the market, making it progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Managers who can endure larger drawdowns will be rewarded with profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

### Diversification for Risk Management
Diversification is always recommended in investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. All trades in a systematic approach are considered equal if they meet entry criteria, as they use the same systems across all markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This allows for accumulating a necessary sample size of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

Current portfolios can trade 200 markets, including single stock futures, currencies, commodities, indices, and interest rates, with aspirations to expand to 300 or 400 markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. While diversification helps, markets can still be highly correlated across sectors, making it difficult to avoid drawdowns completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Without diversification, drawdowns and volatility would be significantly greater than the target rate of return in a stock-only portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

### Long vs. Short Trades in Trend Following
Historically, 80-90% or more of long-term profits in trend following come from long-side trades, not short-side trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This is partly because long trades can go much further, and while markets can go to zero, they tend not to, preventing outsized short-side outlier trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. Longs can start with low volatility, allowing for large positions that then generate outsized profits as volatility increases with rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

However, a good trend follower should not over-rely on past patterns for future expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Shorts, while historically underperforming, are important for increasing sample size and portfolio diversification, and should not be counted out for future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>.

## [[Challenges and considerations in hedge fund management | Challenges and considerations in CTA and Hedge Fund Management]]

The managed futures industry has faced [[Hedge fund management challenges | challenges]], including high leverage, high fees, and high commissions, which have been detrimental to the industry's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Many excellent CTAs manage relatively small amounts of money because they've focused solely on diversified portfolios and not on offering equity products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

Trend following is not synonymous with "managed futures" (currencies, commodities, stocks, and bonds), but rather refers to the principle of following price, taking small losses, and letting profits run on *any* market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. The industry missed a huge opportunity by not aligning with the momentum trading in stocks, which shares similarities with trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. Academic research now places value on trend and momentum, yet CTAs are often sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>.

The fundamental debate is whether one can predict the future or markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Trend following implicitly argues against prediction, relying on price action as a crowd-sourced signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

!> **The Importance of Price Following**
"No matter what happens with the Fed or the world or the wars or the weather, the fundamentals are always changing and can't be predicted. I will be the best person to handle that because I'm not even acknowledging that. I'm not even paying attention to the past about how those fundamentals worked. I'm just going with the trend, with the sort of crowd sourcing of the all the information." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>

## Traits of a Great Trader
To become a great trader or CTA, one needs:
1.  **Commitment to a systematic approach:** This involves using objective information like price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
2.  **Unwavering discipline:** The ability to execute trades without being swayed by external opinions, clients, or internal "bad thoughts" that lead to discretionary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
3.  **Acceptance of imperfections:** Do not try to make systems "too good" or perfect, as this can lead to over-optimization and reduced sample sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. "Good enough should be good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
4.  **Tolerance for losses and drawdowns:** These are an inherent part of a winning system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. A winning system "has to be hard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
5.  **Lack of jealousy:** Avoid being swayed by the short-term good performance of strategies that don't align with a sound philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
6.  **Long-term perspective:** Play for the long term, offering good products with reasonable leverage and expenses, and growing slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>.

A core belief is that one should "love your systems" and "love your losses in your drawdowns" because they are part of a system designed to produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. The biggest failing of traders is not entering a trade due to a few consecutive losses or using filters that look good in backtests but prevent entering large trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. A fail-safe mechanism should always exist to ensure entry into a trade, even if it doesn't perfectly meet all filtered criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

### Personal Habits
A personality that "craves rules" and seeks to understand "what works" in various aspects of life, including trading, is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. This desire for a philosophical approach and "Ten Commandments" of trading helps evaluate specifics through a consistent lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. Sticking to what is known to be right and hard, rather than seeking comfort or approval, is indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>.

### Recommendations for New Entrants
If starting over today, it would be crucial to:
1.  **Grow slowly:** Create a fund with low fees and reasonable leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.
2.  **Focus on client experience:** Concentrate entirely on the experience of the few initial clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
3.  **Avoid high-fee, high-commission managed accounts:** Resist taking on managed accounts with excessive notional equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
4.  **Offer a stock trend-following fund:** Every CTA today should have a stock-only trend-following fund that trades single stocks or indices, aiming to outperform the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>. This would significantly increase the assets under management (AUM) for the CTA industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>.

The CTA industry has suffered by narrowly defining trend following as only managed futures (currencies, commodities, stocks, and bonds), missing opportunities in the stock world where momentum trading is widely accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

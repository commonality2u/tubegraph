The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced global economic dynamics, pushing a move away from [[Impact of globalization and global conflict on investments | globalization]] towards [[fragmentation_and_deglobalization_trends | localization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This shift is primarily due to disruptions in long supply chains, which were a key feature of the globalized economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Drivers of Localization

The coronavirus crisis has highlighted the vulnerabilities of extended supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The need for robust supply chain buffers and quarantine measures for international travel, such as those for shipping goods from China to America, effectively "smashes" the traditional global supply chain map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The simple decision for many businesses is to bring production back onshore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The cost advantages that initially drove relocation of production are no longer present due to these new complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

However, this transition to localization presents its own challenges, such as the lack of skilled labor domestically, as much of it has shifted to countries like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This represents an enormous disturbance to production systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

## Economic Implications

### Deflationary Pressures
Despite the potential for localization to increase costs, the overwhelming trend of the current crisis points towards deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This is largely due to excessive levels of private debt and the resulting fall in effective real demand and the price level, as explained by Irving Fisher's debt deflation theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

The economic impact of the pandemic has been a significant "demand destruction," leading to deflationary pressures and potential business insolvencies, despite market recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Government Debt and Money
The concept of government debt is often misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) posits that the government running a deficit actually generates an identical surplus for the private sector by increasing private bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. A government can maintain permanent negative equity without issue, which is necessary for the non-government sector to be in positive equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

The real concern should be private debt, not government debt, which can be managed by a monetary sovereign government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In fact, running government deficits can increase GDP, thereby reducing government debt as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. Historical periods of governments running surpluses have often preceded major economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

To combat excessive private debt, a "modern debt jubilee" has been proposed, where the government injects cash into household bank accounts, allowing individuals to pay down debt or receive a cash injection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This could also involve corporate share issuance to pay down corporate debt, rebalancing the system from credit-dominated to fiat money-dominated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

### The Role of Inflation and Currency
A depreciating currency, as proposed by Gesell, encourages spending because its value declines over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This concept was demonstrated in WÃ¶rgl, Austria, during the Great Depression, where a depreciating local currency led to zero unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. This suggests that money primarily functions as a means of transaction, and hoarding it reduces its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

Central banks often target a two percent inflation rate, which encourages spending and turns over money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Moderate inflation (2-4%) can make money effective by encouraging transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. Concerns about hyperinflation are largely unfounded for monetarily sovereign countries with trade surpluses, like Japan, which maintains low inflation despite high government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. However, countries with large trade deficits and a lack of monetary sovereignty, like Argentina, are susceptible to runaway inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

## Geopolitical Shifts and Global Trade

The current crisis is expected to lead to a [[fragmentation_and_deglobalization_trends | fragmented globe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Countries that have successfully eliminated the virus (e.g., China, Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Norway, Australia) will be distinct from those enduring wave after wave of infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This will significantly impact international trade and travel, potentially leading to a 15-20% disappearance of GDP from tourism and the airline industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>.

The U.S., as the international reserve currency, can finance its trade deficit because of the demand for American dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. However, the current system of huge and sustained trade deficits and surpluses, not corrected by currency prices, is a major source of global imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

The idea of a new international currency, perhaps a basket of currencies or a version of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) for international trade, could be a beneficial outcome of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. Central bank digital currencies could also play a role, potentially aiding in carbon rationing given the urgency of climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

## Warning Against Austerity
The historical context of Germany in the 1930s serves as a cautionary tale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>. The hyperinflation of the Weimar Republic was less of a problem than the austerity measures that followed the Great Depression, which propelled Adolf Hitler to power as an anti-austerity campaigner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Imposing austerity in the current global economic climate risks creating similar conditions for right-wing demagoguery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>. This concern highlights the [[populism_and_globalization_trends | populism and globalization trends]] and [[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | geopolitical impacts on global markets]] of economic policy.

## European Union and the Euro
The European Union (EU) and the Euro are viewed as potentially tragic mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>. The Euro strips countries of their capacity to create their own money, leading to dilemmas when economic downturns require government surpluses, thereby worsening crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:04">[00:54:04]</a>. Italy, for instance, has economically suffered due to inability to adjust its inflation rate to Germany's, forcing austerity instead of stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

The EU's supranational bureaucracy has proven ineffective in crisis response, as seen with COVID-19, slowing down necessary interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. The ideal solution for Europe would be to revert to national currencies while maintaining a seamless international currency conversion system for easy travel and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. This would allow for different fiscal policies and inflation rates without the industrial destruction seen under the Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. The current crisis could further fragment the EU, as some regions achieve COVID-free status while others struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.

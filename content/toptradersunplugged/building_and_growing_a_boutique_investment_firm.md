Scott Billington, co-founder and managing partner of Covenant Capital Management, offers insights into the unique challenges and strategies involved in establishing and expanding a boutique investment firm. His firm, based in Nashville, Tennessee, with an office in Chicago, was built "in a vacuum" without prior industry connections or substantial initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:25">[05:25:25]</a>.

## Navigating the Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>

Billington openly discusses the difficulties inherent in the hedge fund industry, particularly for those starting a new firm.

### Attracting Investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:32">[01:27:32]</a>
Attracting investors with a long-term horizon is challenging, often feeling "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>. Investors tend to flow in when a firm is "hot" (successful for 24 months) and withdraw during drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>. Billington notes that humans are not "hardwired very well for trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Operational Independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:25">[05:25:25]</a>
Covenant Capital Management chose a path outside traditional financial hubs like New York or Chicago, which meant building the business from scratch without established connections or large initial funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:25">[05:25:25]</a>. They had no "pedigree" or wealthy family connections to provide a launchpad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### Enduring Drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:27">[04:29:27]</a>
One of the firm's proudest achievements is surviving a 20% loss in its second year without altering its [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | trading philosophy]] or method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:27">[04:29:27]</a>. This resilience was crucial, as many firms in similar situations would have folded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:20">[05:13:20]</a>.

## Philosophy and Strategic Approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>

Billington's approach is rooted in a systematic method and a deep understanding of market dynamics.

### Systematic Trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>
A systematic method is a significant advantage as it allows traders to set aside personal opinions and emotions, continuing to methodically apply their chosen strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

### Trend Following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>
Trend following is considered a highly robust and sustainable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. It has been replicated consistently over time and across various markets, making it arguably the most successful method ever created, with the possible exception of value investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. The firm's strategy profits from the "fat tail distribution of price moves," which is academically verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

### Market Volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>
While compression of volatility is generally considered bad for trend followers, Billington distinguishes between volatility pre-trade entry (bad) and post-trade entry (good) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. The most profitable trends are often those that develop smoothly before becoming "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. The perceived correlation between high volatility and trend following success is often a correlation, not a causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>
The firm operates with a long-term mindset. Billington acknowledges that the "largest drawdown is always in front of you," given enough time, just as the best winning period is also yet to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the variance in trading outcomes is much larger than the drift, meaning significant drawdowns are statistically probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

## Risk Management and Position Sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>

Effective [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | position sizing]] is paramount to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

*   **Impact of Sizing:** Even with a positive expected outcome (an "edge"), improper position sizing can turn a profitable strategy into a loser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. Billington illustrates this with a coin-flipping example, showing how risking too much can lead to losses despite having an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.
*   **Optimal Risk Level:** There is an optimal risk level for any given strategy with unknown future wins and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. For their coin-flip example, he suggests 8% as optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.
*   **Fixed Fraction Approach:** Covenant Capital Management consistently uses a standard fixed fraction of the account size to determine risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.
*   **Controlling Risk:** They use stop losses for every position daily to assess the money at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. They also implement maximums at both the individual position and portfolio levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. If these maximums are hit, position sizes are reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
*   **Correlation During Trends:** The firm has observed that market correlations tend to increase when positions are in significant winning trades, which is when risk in positions truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. They assume high correlation within sectors when managing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:00">[25:09:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Complex Risk Models:** Unlike many large financial institutions that use complex, often flawed, derivative risk models, Covenant focuses on the direct, "actual money at risk" between the current market price and their stop-loss point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.
*   **Investor Expectations:** Investors should understand that trend following involves significant potential for losses, and expecting to never lose more than 10% in a year is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.

## Marketing and Business Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>

The firm does not aim to be the largest manager in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:43:00">[39:43:00]</a>. Their strategy is to focus on becoming a very attractive option for a specific type of investor.

*   **Defining Identity:** They understand their identity as a boutique firm and recognize who they are and are not attractive to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>. Resources are not spent chasing investors who won't be a good fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:21:00">[41:21:00]</a>.
*   **Targeting Investors:** Academic research supports the benefits of boutique managers who are nimble but also professionally run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>. These smaller firms can offer a different return stream than larger, more diversified managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:00">[44:26:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Relationships:** Success is highest when they are closer to the person whose money is actually being invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:39:00">[44:39:00]</a>. These investors are more concerned with trust and sound logic than with justifying decisions to an investment board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Image:** Their marketing goal is to ensure potential investors know they exist, have a positive image of them, and have an accurate understanding of their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>.
*   **Client Alignment:** Billington emphasizes that their own money is at risk, side-by-side with their clients' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Firm Founders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>

Scott Billington offers practical advice for those looking to start a trading firm:

*   **Operational Capital:** Secure enough operational capital to sustain the business for at least five years without relying on income from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:02:00">[52:02:00]</a>. This buffer allows the "small tree" of the business to grow roots without immediate financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:27:00">[53:27:00]</a>.
*   **Realistic Goals:** Define clear goals for the firm's size. Unless founders have significant connections ("pedigree"), aiming to be a multi-billion dollar firm might be unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:19:00">[52:19:00]</a>.
*   **Team Composition:** Build a team with diverse skill sets, including sales, scientific acumen, and programming abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:55:00">[53:55:00]</a>.
*   **Partnership Structure:** For partnerships, ensure philosophies and goals for the company and personal lives are aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>. All agreements should be written down, even among friends, to prevent future misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>. Addressing potential changes in personal financial goals is also crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:44:00">[56:44:00]</a>.
*   **Early Career Path:** Instead of immediately [[starting_a_trading_firm_at_a_young_age | starting a firm]], it might be advisable to work with smaller and then larger firms to build contacts and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:56:00">[58:56:00]</a>.
*   **Luck and Timing:** Early success often requires some luck, as attracting money can be difficult until a firm has demonstrated a couple of strong years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:38:00">[58:38:00]</a>.

## Personal Habits and Philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:08:00">[59:08:00]</a>

Billington believes trading is "simple but difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a> and does not require a "mystical" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:30:00">[59:30:00]</a>.

*   **Core Elements:** Success stems from a non-random method of entering and exiting markets, appropriate risk management based on the captured edge, and the discipline to consistently follow the established system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:43:00">[59:43:00]</a>.
*   **Automated Discipline:** To counter personal emotions, Billington created a system and even hired someone to execute trades, further removing discretionary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.
*   **Health and Well-being:** Maintaining good health, eating properly, and exercising are advisable due to the stressful nature of trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. He cautions against substance abuse and the "cowboy mentality" sometimes associated with the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.
*   **Mindset:** Key characteristics for a trader include an analytical mind, strong probabilistic thinking, and the humility to admit when wrong (Covenant loses 70% of its trades) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Focus on Impactful Trades:** The most important aspect is the handling of large moves, as a single winning trade can offset many small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The firm has a win ratio of 30-33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Unasked Investor Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:15:00">[46:15:00]</a>

Billington suggests investors should ask more qualitative questions beyond typical due diligence:

*   **Robustness of Method:** Inquire about the number of parameters used, how changes to parameters (e.g., 5-8%) would affect returns, and the justification for specific numerical choices (e.g., why a 50-day window instead of 49 or 45) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:32:00">[46:32:00]</a>. This probes the [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | robustness]] and repeatability of the method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:26:00">[47:26:00]</a>.
*   **Experiential Due Diligence:** Investors should have individuals with actual trading experience conduct due diligence, as they can identify specific pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:03:00">[48:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cost Management:** For high-frequency traders, ask how costs are handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>. For less frequent traders like Covenant, question the trade-off between lower costs and fewer compounding instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:20:00">[48:20:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance Nuances:** Ask about the firm's "luckiest" and "least lucky" periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:11:00">[49:11:00]</a>.
*   **Parameter and Market Breadth:** Question the individual impact of each parameter and whether the strategy has been tested successfully across various markets (e.g., if it works on S&P, does it work on Dow, NASDAQ, Euro stocks, or other commodities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a>.

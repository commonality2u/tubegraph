## Market Observations and Biases
Jim Cosang observed "group think" at an endowment conference, noting how professionals were not open to the possibility that the traditional 60/40 portfolio might not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Exposure to private equity and venture capital was increasing meaningfully (e.g., 65/35 heavy private equity/venture), which he views as "recency bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Neils Kastr Larson reiterated the importance of avoiding groupthink and recency bias, especially in a world that may change dramatically in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

He highlighted that [[Systematic trend following strategies and performance | trends]] driving populist and protectionist rhetoric were foreseen, with figures like Trump serving as a "vehicle for something much bigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The current period feels like a "regime change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Current Performance of [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | Trend Following]]
As of early 2025, [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following]] approaches are showing constructive signs:
*   Weak bond markets, particularly in Europe (UK, France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   Long equities and a strong US dollar are favorable for [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   Smaller markets like live cattle have been "incredibly generous" to [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   Gold, silver, and grains are also offering good opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Neils's own [[Systematic trend following strategies and performance | trend barometer]] was strong, closing at 59, indicating a good start to 2025 for [[Systematic trend following strategies and performance | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Performance metrics (as of Wednesday):

## Volatility and Skew in Markets
Jim discusses the "long-term skew in Vol markets" being "well bid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Skew Definition**: Skew refers to how high downside option volatility is relative to upside options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. In equity indices, it's typically higher on the put (downside insurance) side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Current Situation**: Long-term skew (two, three, four months out) has remained "very sticky and steep" since before the August meltdown, exacerbated by structured product demand and year-end options expiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Implications**: This indicates a supply-demand imbalance where people are "really short the skew in the back end of the curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Entities are selling longer, further out-of-the-money skew to cover closer shorts, which can lead to a "longer term structural decline" if a real decline begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Parallels**: Similar patterns were observed leading into the 2008 financial crisis (2007) and the dot-com bubble burst (1998-99) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Vaga Response**: A significant "Vaga response" (sensitivity of option price to changes in implied volatility) and more Vaga relative to gamma can "exacerbate not just a vol event but... a multi-year type decline" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **CBOE Skew Index**: While the CBOE has a skew index showing a trend towards near highs, Jim notes it's "not a good measure of skew"; a Delta sticky measure is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

## Short-Term Market Outlook
Jim foresaw a constructive period into year-end 2024, but strength of flows (Vanna and Charm) indicated an early end to the rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. He now anticipates a potential 10% decline (peak to trough) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, viewing the initial decline as the beginning of a larger one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

He expects a counter-trend rally after the initial decline, which "will be sold" and eventually lead to a bigger decline as the year progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The upcoming January options expiration (Opex) on Friday and Monday can be "incredibly violent" when not strong, due to large open interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This could cause a "convex move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, potentially a 150-200 point drop in the S&P over two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The decline is expected to be a "stair-step down" rather than sharp, because short-dated volatility and gamma are well supplied, making long-dated puts continue to rise in price and forcing people to use "Band-Aids" that don't fix the underlying issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. A short-term bottom could be found in weeks or a month, followed by a "pretty painful" counter-trend rally for shorts, before another decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

The February Opex to March Opex cycle is noted as an important period, reminiscent of the COVID crash cycle, where a large amount of open interest and risk in options and structured products accelerated the 30% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. This represents a "real risk in the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## Historical Context and Inflationary Periods
The S&P 500 had its best two-calendar-year performance since 1988 at the end of last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Historically, two consecutive positive years like this often lead to an expected negative return the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

In "structurally inflationary periods" driven by populism and protectionism (as seen from 1968 to 1982), equity markets experienced "incredibly poor performance" (67% real negative returns over 14 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. However, during election years within that cycle, average performance was 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. All five populist elections (including the last two) have shown double-digit returns, averaging 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This suggests that recent market boosts from election-year spending may need to be "given back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

## Vanna and Charm Flows
Jim discusses Vanna and Charm flows, noting that a "counter-trend rally" is likely in the short term after a "cathartic action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. When gamma events are not large enough, or a decline slows, Vanna (the expansion of volatility) compresses, leading to powerful rallies, similar to what was seen in August or during COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. There is still significant open interest in January, making a counter-trend rally plausible due to potential positive flows after a "cathartic drop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

## Interest Rate Markets
Interest rates, or the cost of money, are considered "the most important thing by far" for asset performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. During inflationary periods (like 1968-1982), even with strong economic growth, equity market and asset returns can be very poor in real terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.

Two main drivers for poor asset returns during rising interest rates:
1.  **Multiple Contraction**: If 10-year bonds offer a 20% yield, investors won't pay a 25 P/E ratio for the market. The S&P 500 P/E ratio dropped from approximately 25 in 1968 to 4.5 in 1982, aligning with a 20% earnings yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
2.  **Margin Contraction**: Corporate margins, currently at record highs, could collapse as interest rates rise secularly, similar to 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>.

Jim also notes:
*   The market was previously inefficient, offering an "inverted" yield curve where one could get paid to hedge interest rate inflation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   Now, with an "upward sloping" curve, it is "hard to hedge" and "increasingly difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
*   Many seasoned professionals still suggest equities as an inflation hedge, which is a "complete misunderstanding" during structural inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.
*   The "pain trade" (where people are stuck) is the most likely outcome, leading to further pain when hedging becomes hard and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
*   Many entities have significant bond exposure and are leveraged, making them vulnerable to rising rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   Rising interest rates are a feedback mechanism to inflation itself, as the cost of money increases the cost of goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. This can become exponential as inflation expectations lead people to pull forward demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
*   Many portfolio managers have not experienced a structural interest rate increase in their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>, leading to "recency bias" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. An example is municipal bonds with calls, where effective duration can jump from 5 to 15 years if yields rise, due to calls coming off the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

## Political Influence on the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve, theoretically independent, is the most powerful entity in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>. However, its dual mandate of managing price and GDP growth puts it in a difficult position when these objectives contradict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

A Trump administration is expected to exert significant influence on the Fed, potentially appointing a "Shadow Fed" if current leadership (like Jerome Powell) does not "play ball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>. This would involve a new Fed chair announcing policy to discredit the current Fed, forcing compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. This level of political influence is likened to "Nixon on steroids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. Important economic numbers like unemployment and CPI will be more critical due to this potential political shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.

The hosts also discuss a vacuum of leadership in other major global institutions (e.g., WTO, WHO, EU), which are acknowledging failures and a need for reform to regain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. The shift from a world where the Federal Reserve could linearly control volatility and drive globalization (resulting in 40 years of peace and stability) to one with "more realized vol" and "less stability" means more global conflict and breakdown of institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

## China and Geopolitical Shifts
While China has "massive structural problems," Jim suggests that when "everyone abandon[s] an asset" like China, and US assets become dislocated, a "catalyst" for change is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.

Counterintuitively, a Trump administration, despite being perceived as "tough on China" due to past actions, might shift its focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. Given Trump's willingness to work with Russia, and the strong alliance between Russia and China (publicly solidified in February 2022 before the Ukraine invasion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>, Trump might not be as strong against China as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Clues include:
*   Comments about Taiwan having to pay for U.S. defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   Tariffs potentially focusing on Canada and Mexico instead of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>.
*   Rhetoric (like Greenland and Panama Canal) serving to project strength while potentially making a deal with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>.

This potential "Art of the Deal" with China could be economically supportive in the short term and help manage inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. Jim suggests an "asymmetric trade" in China, with a higher probability (30-40%) than often perceived, where the magnitude of reversion to the mean could lead to a "dramatic opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.

## Elon Musk and Narrative Influence
Elon Musk is expected to become more vocal, especially with a Trump presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. As a "strong ally" who "runs the Town Square" (referring to X/Twitter), Musk is anticipated to push narratives to move outcomes, as he has successfully done in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. His incentives may also influence Trump's decisions, potentially leading to pressure within the administration to "fix the China problem in the short term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. This dynamic will likely create more volatility and dispersion in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

A [[Current and future societal changes | new world order]] is becoming clearer, driven significantly by [[Demographic changes and their economic implications | geopolitical and demographic shifts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a>. Peter Zeihan, a geopolitical strategist and author, emphasizes understanding these changes to make sense of the evolving global landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

## Historical Context: Post-World War II Global System

Following World War II, the United States fundamentally altered the global economic structure from an imperial system to one of free trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:44">[05:02:44]</a>. The U.S. Navy guaranteed open sea lanes for trade to any nation that aligned with the United States during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:46">[05:35:46]</a>. This system enabled smaller countries and former colonial possessions to achieve independence, specialize, trade, and expand their economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:27">[06:00:27]</a>.

As countries became wealthier, populations shifted from rural farms to urban cities. This urbanization led to a significant drop in birth rates, as children became an expense rather than a benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:12">[06:18:12]</a>. This trend of urbanization, industrialization, and declining birth rates spread globally after the fall of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:12">[06:36:12]</a>.

## The Current Demographic Crisis

All these issues are converging in the current decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:04">[06:55:04]</a>. The United States has lost interest in maintaining the globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:10">[06:59:10]</a>. Crucially, the advanced world no longer has enough young people to regenerate its demographic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:06">[07:06:06]</a>. These populations are now moving into mass retirement, and even younger countries have aged past the point of demographic reconstitution in most cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:06">[07:13:06]</a>.

### Economic Implications

This top-heavy demography, which previously generated capital as people saved before retirement, is now leading to an impending [[Future implications of fiscal restraint and demographic changes on the economy | investment bust]], a production bust, and a consumption bust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:50">[07:26:50]</a>. There is currently no economic model that can effectively operate in such an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:17">[07:46:17]</a>. This demographic shift means the world will never return to the consumption and production balance seen in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:04">[08:47:04]</a>.

## Impact on Major Global Powers

### China
China's demographic issues are considered terminal. Recent data suggests its population may have peaked as early as 2003 and could have been overcounted by as many as 100 million people, largely women born after the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:40">[12:26:40]</a>. This makes China's demography more terminal than Germany's or Russia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:03">[12:44:03]</a>. Labor costs in China have increased by a factor of 15 since 1999, while productivity has only doubled, indicating that [[Impact of Technology on Economy and Media | technology]] has not fundamentally altered this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:05">[12:58:05]</a>.

The Chinese economy, heavily reliant on imports of energy, foodstuffs, and fertilizer, would be devastated by sanctions similar to those imposed on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:10">[21:35:10]</a>. Boycotts by foreign corporations, essential for China's development model and technological transfer, are also a major threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:19">[21:54:19]</a>. China's inability to effectively combat COVID-19 due to ineffective vaccines also makes it an unreliable supply chain partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:19">[23:35:19]</a>.

### United States
The United States has a healthier demography in the rich world compared to other advanced nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:51">[13:42:51]</a>. Its baby boomer class is proportionally the smallest globally, meaning its financial crunch will not be as severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:01">[43:42:01]</a>. The US also benefits from energy self-sufficiency, being a major agricultural exporter, and having Mexico as a neighbor with a healthy demography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:13">[43:35:13]</a>. These factors allow the U.S. to potentially navigate these demographic challenges more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:58:01">[43:58:01]</a>.

## Impact on Technology

A thriving tech sector requires many clever, highly educated young people and substantial capital for development, prototyping, and operationalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. The global baby bust (50 years old) means most countries lack sufficient young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:51">[13:42:51]</a>. With the baby boomer generation retiring, the global capital base is also diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:39">[13:51:39]</a>. Therefore, the pace of global technological advancement is expected to slow considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:14">[14:06:14]</a>.

While areas like Silicon Valley in the U.S. will likely continue to innovate due to its millennial generation, many complementary systems around the world that provide cooperation or competition will be absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:59">[14:09:59]</a>.

## Impact on Democracy and Governance

In times of stress, the state tends to strengthen, while in times of war, it tends to weaken by needing to gather wider support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:55:09">[41:55:09]</a>. The coming era will see simultaneous breakdowns in manufacturing, transport, energy, and agriculture, potentially making at least half the world's population food insecure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:35:05">[42:35:05]</a>. Such conditions are unlikely to strengthen states universally and will likely lead to state dissolution in more places than seen in the last 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:07:05">[43:07:05]</a>.

The entire economic model—whether fascism, communism, socialism, or capitalism—is based on the concept of a stable or growing economic "pie," usually due to population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:40:48">[44:40:48]</a>. With population collapse, the pie will shrink and fragment, forcing each nation to find its own way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:38">[44:54:38]</a>. The preservation of democracy will become a value statement to be fought for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:18">[45:02:18]</a>. Regions like Central and Southern Europe face greater risks to their democracies than Northern or Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:14:14">[45:14:14]</a>.

### Autocracy and Technology
While technology can empower autocratic regimes through surveillance and information control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>, historical autocracies have often been unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:37">[48:15:37]</a>. China's current system, leveraging technology for control, is an extreme example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:52:16">[48:52:16]</a>. This system remains stable as long as basic needs are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:23:44">[50:23:44]</a>. However, factors like endless COVID lockdowns, food insecurity (e.g., African swine fever), energy issues, and deglobalization could change this math, potentially leading to instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:05">[50:47:05]</a>.

## Financial and Investment Implications

The period of bottomless capital supplies is ending, making capital harder to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. This will likely lead to fewer financial professionals who must demonstrate added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

From a macro perspective, the stability required for stock markets may diminish in many places, leading to the disappearance of smaller stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. Bonds will see increased demand but extreme costs due to limited investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. The financial climate could resemble the "dark doldrums" of the mid-1970s following the oil crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

Historically, currency systems backed by metals have failed due to their success, as the need for more metal eventually forced expansion and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. In a deglobalizing world, where agriculture and energy supplies are uncertain, trust will be paramount for fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. The United States is likely to remain the dominant global currency, possibly the only one of significant size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. This view contrasts with investment theses relying on continued globalization and peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

### Investment Strategies
Given these trends, investment opportunities are best sought in:
*   Large markets with deep liquidity, primarily the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.
*   Products that are energy-intensive to produce within the U.S. due to its cheap oil, natural gas, and electricity from the shale revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a>.
*   Sectors where demand is demographically driven, leveraging the healthier demographies of the U.S. and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.
*   Exportable products, capitalizing on the arbitrage opportunity as global supply chains break down and North American ones strengthen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>.
*   Commodities that are no longer flowing from the Russian system due to the Ukraine war, such as bauxite, aluminum, titanium, steel, pig iron, wheat, and nitrogen/phosphate-based fertilizers, especially from American firms not exposed to the former Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>.

Investors must do their homework and cannot rely on broad index funds, ETFs, or high-frequency trading in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

## Broader Concerns: The Food Crisis

Among the most significant concerns is the global food situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Globalization allowed agricultural producers to specialize in crops best suited to their climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. With the breakdown of the global system, countries will need to become more responsible for their own food production, leading to less specialization and a reduction in overall calorie output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. The breakdown in the fertilizer supply chain, exacerbated by the Ukraine war, further compounds this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

Even without wars, simply matching each country's production to its needs could reduce global calorie output by more than half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This means a minimum of three billion more people than the world can support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>. While gains in technology and shifts in protein consumption could mitigate this, potentially reducing famine deaths to "only" a billion people over the next two decades, these are still horrific and seemingly unavoidable shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

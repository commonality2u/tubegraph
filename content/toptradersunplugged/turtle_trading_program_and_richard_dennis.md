It's important to remember that all discussions about investment performance refer to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. All investment strategies carry a significant risk of financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Richard Dennis's Famous Turtle Program

Richard Dennis's famous [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle program]] was a unique experiment that significantly shaped what is known today as the Managed Futures or CTA industry, and in particular, the trend following world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Though now well-known, for many years it remained one of the industry's best-kept secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The story gained wider recognition over the last decade, partly due to Michael Covel's books on the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Jerry Parker, founder and president of Chesapeake Capital, was selected to be part of Richard Dennis's [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle program]] in 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He has often been described as the most successful "Turtle" ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Jerry Parker's Journey to the Turtles

In 1983, Jerry Parker was working in public accounting in Richmond, Virginia, desiring a more interesting and rewarding career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He had a hobby interest in the stock market and trading and had come across literature concerning trend following, which he felt "made a lot of sense" to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. From the very beginning, he found a [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | systematic approach]] and trend following perfectly sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. He would watch "Wall Street Week" and found encouragement from discussions on price trends, risk control, taking small losses, and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### The Wall Street Journal Advertisement

Jerry Parker stumbled upon the famous advertisement in The Wall Street Journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He had previously heard of Richard Dennis through a *Business Week* article titled "The Barefoot Trader," which described Dennis trading without shoes in his office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This prior knowledge immediately lent legitimacy to the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

The advertisement, placed by Richard J. Dennis and C.D. Commodities, sought applicants for the position of commodity futures trader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. It stated that Mr. Dennis and his associates would train a small group of applicants in his proprietary trading concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Successful candidates would trade solely for Mr. Dennis, receive a percentage of their profits, and be allowed a small draw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Prior trading experience was considered but not necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Applicants were required to send a brief resume with a one-sentence reason for applying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Application and Interview Process

Approximately a thousand people applied in October-November 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Applicants received a 100-question true/false test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Jerry Parker scored the highest on this test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. About 40 people were invited for an interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Jerry Parker was hired in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The requirement for a one-sentence response was a recurring theme, even for questions asked of the Turtles after they were hired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Richard Dennis (Rich) was primarily running the show, with Bill Eckhardt as his trusted friend and associate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. During his interview, Jerry Parker was asked how he thought he performed on the test, to which he replied "pretty well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. He believes he excelled due to his familiarity with trend following concepts and a "contrarian thinking" approach to the test questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

A famous question Richard Dennis asked was: "How much do you think you already know about trading on a scale from 0 to 100%?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> Jerry Parker answered "about 90%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. In contrast, Liz Cheval, the only woman hired in the first class, answered "close to zero," which Jerry Parker noted showed proper humbleness and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

After being hired, Jerry Parker moved to Chicago in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. He sold his car and microwave and found a great apartment overlooking the beach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### The Turtle Training and Philosophy

The first class of 11 Turtles (including Liz Cheval) had a two or three-week training period, eight hours a day, at the Union League Club in Chicago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. The second class, a year later, consisted of eight people, bringing the total to around 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. All Turtles traded from an office in the Insurance Exchange building, separate from Richard Dennis's main office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

The training focused on the [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | philosophy]] of the trading systems, trend following, and specific entry and exit signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. More broadly, it instilled a mindset and philosophy on how to approach and think about markets, emphasizing that specific parameters might need adjustment over time as markets evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. The program also covered trading psychology, statistics, and math concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

A key aspect of the training was the environment of encouragement and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. If a Turtle lost money, they were evaluated based on whether they followed the systems, not solely on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. Richard Dennis, as their "client," created and deeply believed in the systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. This mentorship provided a strong foundation that extended beyond mere system specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

Jerry Parker noted that the concepts made sense to him immediately, and he was comfortable following them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. His initial focus was ensuring Richard Dennis was happy and not "blowing this opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The program also aimed to gather insights from the Turtles' trading experiences, though competitive dynamics and the fear of straying from the rules limited individual creativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:22:11]</a>.

A central tenet taught by Richard Dennis was to "love your system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. This meant embracing all its characteristics, including:
*   Less than 50% winning trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>
*   Lots of small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>
*   Big profits turning into small profits or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>
*   Drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>
*   Really bad days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>

One of the true/false questions on the Turtle test was: "A Trader should love to take losses" (True), because taking losses is part of the system, and you must love your system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. However, this philosophy becomes challenging when dealing with clients who may not share the same understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. The [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle program]] was exceptional because Richard Dennis, as the client, fully understood and believed in the systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

### Early Trading Experience

Turtles began trading on January 2, 1984, each managing $1 million, strictly adhering to the rules for entries, exits, and trading size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Jerry Parker initially had a slow start and was timid, not taking enough trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Richard Dennis, being understanding and motivating, encouraged him to take all the trades the system indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

The most difficult aspect for Jerry Parker initially was "pulling the trigger" on trades, specifically buying breakouts and following the trend, due to a fear of losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. Later, getting out of trades too quickly to preserve profit also became a challenge, as the system often required holding positions much longer than felt comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

### Conclusion of The Program and Evolution of Strategies

The [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle program]] was initially expected to last five years and concluded in early 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. After the program ended, Jerry Parker felt a new freedom to develop his own ideas, as he no longer had to please Richard Dennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This marked the beginning of his firm, Chesapeake Capital, in February 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

Jerry Parker started Chesapeake Capital with a $2 million managed account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>. He decided to trade with less leverage and risk than the Turtles, aiming for a 20% annual return instead of the 150-200% returns seen during the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. Despite a 60% loss in one day during the Turtle program in 1986 due to a massive counter-trend move in crude oil, he adhered to the rules taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:36:39]</a>.

At Chesapeake's start, he experienced a 20% drawdown and lost his initial $2 million client, being left with a $300,000 client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. However, strong trends that summer led to good profits, and by the end of 1988, he was up nearly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

Jerry Parker's [[historical_evolution_and_strategy_changes_in_turtle_trading | evolution]] of trading strategies has always been focused on becoming more longer-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. This adjustment proved necessary over the years due to choppier trends and the growth of trend followers and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. Longer-term exits help to stay in trends and avoid whipsaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

From almost day one, Jerry Parker hired researchers and programmers to analyze markets, evolving his approach from the very beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. Richard Dennis considered this continuous research mandatory for updating parameters and uncovering insights from past data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:33">[00:40:33]</a>.

A core focus for Jerry Parker has always been diversification, adding more markets, and adopting non-US markets and single stock futures early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:42:15]</a>. He aimed to trade as many markets as possible, even correlated ones, and divide his risk budget among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

He has consistently resisted adding anything counter-trend or mean-reversion to his trend-following systems, believing his original philosophy, as taught by the Turtles, to be the most robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. He emphasizes that while new "improvements" might improve backtests, they often don't improve future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.

In the early 2000s, his systems became "a little bit too optimized" with "non-trend following components" that he later removed around 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. This often happened when managers, despite good performance, tried to minimize drawdowns or "bad parts" of trend following, leading to unintended elimination of "good parts" too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:17">[00:47:17]</a>. This included practices like taking profits too early, preventing giving back profit, or resizing positions based on new volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

### The [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | Philosophy of Trend Following]]

Jerry Parker considers trend following, as he was taught, to be the "least risky investment strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>. He breaks it down into essential components:
1.  **Diversification**: Trading many different markets, both long and short positions, to participate in various trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.
2.  **Systematic Approach**: Backtesting rules to ensure they work, having thousands of trades in the sample size, and strictly following those rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>.
3.  **Long-Term Nature**: Being as long-term as necessary to capture trends and avoid whipsaws, even though shorter terms might reduce pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

Other key elements include taking small losses, letting profits run, using a trailing stop, and paying attention only to market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

> [01:02:25] I used to say we take a small loss, but I think it's better to take an optimal loss.

An "optimal loss" means using computer analysis to determine the ideal stop-loss placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>. A stop loss that is too small can lead to excessive whipsawing and a very low winning percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. An optimal stop loss aims for a winning percentage in the low 40s while avoiding too many short-term entries and exits, which incur high trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.

Jerry Parker criticizes the managed futures industry and some CTAs, including his own firm at times, for mishandling these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. This includes using too much leverage, leading to large drawdowns (30-40%) that prevent clients from experiencing the system's benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:58">[00:52:17]</a>. High fees and commissions have also overwhelmed the positive characteristics of trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>. He believes that resisting portfolio management tactics that destroy the core system's robustness, such as overly adjusting positions based on volatility or "non-system trades," is correct in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:15">[00:54:15]</a>.

Richard Dennis taught that if a trader lost 50% of their money, they would likely be fired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>. However, he also emphasized that he would evaluate performance based on adherence to the rules: making money without following rules could lead to termination, while losing money *while* following the rules might be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. This highlights the challenge of evaluating traders based on small sample sizes, where "bad ideas can seem to work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>.

### Reflections on Performance and Market Environments

Jerry Parker considers the period from 2005-2007, and especially the last four years (from the time of recording), as challenging for the industry due to a lack of strong trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. He distinguishes between [[history and evolution of trading programs | trend following]] and managed futures, noting that trend following thrives when markets are trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

In 2008, despite being a strong year for the industry, Chesapeake underperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This was partly due to reducing leverage in late 2007 after a bad draw down and maintaining that lower leverage throughout 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. He stresses the importance of choosing a moderate and constant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. While their systems underperformed in 2008, they overperformed in 2009, illustrating a "yin and yang" or "seesaw" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:58:03]</a>.

Jerry Parker believes that the recent challenges are not due to trend following being "broken," but rather from investment allocation decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. For instance, his firm had 40-50% of its risk exposure in commodities, which had been flatlining for four or five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. Systems that performed poorly in commodities might perform well in more trending markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. Trend following is "broken" if traded too short-term, but a longer-term approach continues to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

For investors looking at performance, Jerry Parker emphasizes the importance of looking at track records, specifically their longevity and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. However, he cautions against trying to pinpoint the "top five" traders for the future, as most CTAs and trend-following systems tend to yield similar results over long periods (10-20 years), despite short-term variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>. He notes that investors are often "totally shocked" when a top manager has a poor year, as if they can defy universal laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:54">[01:05:54]</a>.

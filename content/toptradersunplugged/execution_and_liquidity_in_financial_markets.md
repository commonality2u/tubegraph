Marty Leck, co-founder and director of research at Aspect Capital, discusses the evolution of execution strategies and the critical role of [[impact_of_liquidity_on_global_financial_markets | liquidity]] in managing a diversified trading program. The firm's approach emphasizes meticulous execution, robust risk management, and continuous adaptation to market dynamics to ensure efficient and invisible trading.

## Challenges in Execution and Market Impact
Early in Aspect Capital's history, a significant challenge was the firm's [[the_impact_of_market_liquidity_and_flows | market impact]], which made their trades too visible, allowing others to "pick them off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This issue arose as the interbank market became more democratized, giving more participants access to the same price feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Evolution of Execution Strategies
To mitigate market impact, Aspect Capital developed strategies to make their entry and exit to markets smoother and effectively invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This involved a "huge development and huge focus on execution" to dribble trades into the markets in random pieces with random delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The goal is to exploit [[volatility_in_financial_markets | market volatility]] rather than forcing business to get done quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

The firm's trading operations are now predominantly "box to box" (electronic execution), with about 96% of strategy trading being electronic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This process is monitored 24 hours a day by an experienced trading team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The shift to a predominantly box-to-box world represented an "enormous commitment of research effort and investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

> [!info] Execution Algorithm Goals
> Aspect Capital's execution algorithms are designed to make their presence in the market "invisible" or to "obfuscate" their activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. They are not in a hurry to complete their business and aim to capture a "patient premium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This contrasts with High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms, as Aspect Capital does not engage in HFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

## Monitoring and Adapting to Liquidity
Aspect Capital's portfolio construction begins with an agnostic outlook, seeking the "most agnostic portfolio construction" possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This broad diversification across seven sectors is then flexed based on long-term structural correlations between markets and, critically, the [[impact_of_liquidity_on_global_financial_markets | liquidity characteristics of the market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This review is done regularly, allowing the portfolio allocation structure to gently adjust to different liquidity conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

The firm imposes conservative constraints on how much of the average daily volume or open interest they are prepared to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This systematic process regularly determines the allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. While there is considerable capacity for growth, the firm is careful to understand how changes in the program might impact correlation structures and potential market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. They emphasize the importance of being aware of their own size and "what's going on in the market," recognizing that markets could "dry up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

> "Number one you need to be cognizant of not just your own size but also what's going on in the market so you know you could stand still and the markets could dry up so you need you need to be aware of that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>

Concerns exist about [[impact_of_liquidity_on_global_financial_markets | liquidity drying up]] again, particularly in interbank foreign exchange markets, given events like the 2008-2009 crisis and ongoing issues in the banking sector and actions by [[role_of_central_banks_in_financial_markets | central banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Aspect Capital responds to sporadic changes in liquidity profiles, such as expanding spreads or unfavorable execution behavior, through their monitored systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This includes having backup prime brokerage and multiple clearing house relationships to ensure operational robustness if lines freeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

The firm continuously monitors and includes new markets, such as non-deliverable forward currencies, to expand opportunities, despite the added complexity of monitoring their liquidity profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Risk Management and Market Characteristics
The effectiveness of a trading strategy depends on the holistic combination of models, markets, and overall risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Position sizes are a function of signal strength and conviction, modulated by the perceived risk (volatility) of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. This means if a market's volatility doubles, the position size is halved to maintain the same risk for a given signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Rather than using traditional stop-losses, the firm employs a "gradually modulating signal" where position size automatically adjusts with changes in signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The firm's execution algorithms are regularly reparameterized to adapt to changing market characteristics, such as resting bid-offer spreads and typical clip sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

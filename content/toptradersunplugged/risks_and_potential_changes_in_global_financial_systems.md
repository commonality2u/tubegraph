## The Fracturing World

The world is experiencing increasing fragmentation, both internationally and domestically, particularly within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This shift is characterized by a lack of shared basic values and tenets among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Internationally, this is evident in geopolitical tensions, such as Russia's perceived need for Ukraine's security and China's desire for Taiwan's unification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Domestically in the U.S., extreme polarization on contentious issues creates a risk of significant social disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The financial system is seen as "breaking" and not receiving enough information to self-correct, further cementing this fracturization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This environment suggests a "new world order" is emerging, prompting exploration into its [[global_macroeconomic_environments|global macroeconomic environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Federal Reserve's Role and Monetary Policy

Joseph Wang, known as "The Fed Guy," an insider who spent five years on the Open Market Desk at the New York Fed, provides insights into the workings of the U.S. financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### The Open Market Desk

The Open Market Desk is central to the dollar system, acting as its ultimate and infinite provider of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. It has access to extensive regulatory and financial data and open communication lines with major market participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. During crises, like the breaking Treasury markets in March (presumably 2020), the Desk undertakes massive operations, including trillions in quantitative easing (QE), hundreds of billions in repo trades, and hundreds of billions in FX swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Being on the Desk means being among the first to know when something is breaking and being able to act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Monetary Policy Channels: Supply-Side and Wealth Effect

Monetary policy, primarily focused on interest rates, has largely acted as a supply-side policy over the past two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Lower rates primarily benefit corporations, allowing them to tap bond markets at rates barely above Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. However, this money often does not "trickle down" to increased hiring or investment in factories, instead going towards stock buybacks or executive pay, leading to asset inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. This disproportionate flow can cause socially undesirable distributional effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

The Federal Reserve's main tool today appears to be the "wealth effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Raising or lowering rates impacts financial asset values, which in turn influences demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. While other channels like deposit betas (how deposit rates are affected by policy rates) and borrowing/lending channels exist, they are slower to transmit through the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. The most immediate impact is seen in the large losses for fixed income holders and declining equity prices, which effectively "haircuts wealth" to reduce demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This is an unconventional channel that the Fed has become more willing to deploy since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### Fiscal Policy and Inflation

The current surge in inflation is linked to a fundamental rethinking of how fiscal policy is conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. When a sovereign government finances spending by printing debt, it's essentially printing money, especially in the U.S. where Treasuries are very money-like due to deep repo and cash markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The U.S. is projected to have trillion-dollar deficits for the next decade and beyond, with additional spending like student loan forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This revolutionary shift in fiscal policy is considered a bigger driver of inflation than monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

The Fed's effectiveness is hampered because Congress, as a public sector actor, is not sensitive to the costs of higher interest rates when it comes to fiscal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. If the Fed raises rates, the federal government, being the largest borrower, simply prints more Treasuries to pay for it, creating a potential "doom loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. This structural difference means the Fed's tools may be ill-equipped to deal with what's coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Aging Population and Labor Supply

Beyond fiscal policy, other fundamental factors are influencing inflation, such as demographic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. While past decades saw an increase in labor supply due to globalization and younger generations, the future holds an aging global population and reduced labor supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. This reduction in labor supply, exemplified by Baby Boomers retiring in the U.S., drives the price of labor higher, leading to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. These are secular trends that cannot be changed by monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

## Reversing Globalization and Divergent Policies

The observed synchronization of major global economies since the 1980s and 1990s, driven by globalization, increased trade, integrated supply chains, and open capital accounts, is now reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This means a shift from a world where U.S. economic performance mirrored the rest of the world, to one with greater divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Bond market yields previously co-moved easily due to money flowing freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, and U.S. fiscal stimulus boosted factory conditions in China due to global demand and supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

This reversal is occurring in both the real economy and the monetary sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The world is moving towards fragmentation, with an emerging axis between Russia, China, the Middle East, and India, distinct from the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This will impede the free flow of commodities and supply chains, leading to more divergent economic conditions where U.S. demand shocks may not easily pass to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

There are also greater divergences in [[global_monetary_system_changes|monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. While much of the central banking community is tightening accommodative policy, the Bank of Japan is not, causing major fissures in the FX market, as seen with the USD/JPY rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This signifies a reversal of several decades of convergence and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## The Dollar's Exorbitant Privilege and Its Challenges

The "exorbitant privilege" of the dollar as the dominant global currency, maintaining a "cage around volatility" with its infinite liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>, is now showing cracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. While the Fed has complete control over rates and FX, it lacks power over inflation and real economy matters, which are not financial and cannot be "printed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

### Russia's Frozen Assets and Sovereign Risk

The dollar's status as the global reserve currency means everyone needs to hold dollars for international trade (about half of world trade is invoiced in dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Foreign sovereigns hold dollar assets, typically U.S. Treasuries, as reserves to support their companies and banks, which historically kept U.S. interest rates low due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.

The freezing of Russia's assets put a crack in this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. Sovereigns prioritize risk-free assets and losing access to them, even if temporarily frozen, poses an existential risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:06">[00:50:06]</a>. This action prompts other countries, like China with its large dollar exposure, to seek alternatives to reduce their vulnerability to similar actions based on U.S. political or social grievances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. This quest for alternatives means less demand for Treasuries, leading to higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

However, even if rates go too high, the Fed can buy them all, and if the dollar weakens, it can be defended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. The true risk is if these actions lead to higher prices and inflation in the real economy, as the Fed cannot print real goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. Paradoxically, the Fed might lose control over its primary mandate (price stability) rather than its secondary mandates (asset prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

### The Future of Safe Assets

The concept of "safe assets" is undergoing a re-evaluation due to increased political risk at both sovereign and individual levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. Losing bank accounts for disagreeing with the government, as seen in Canada, highlights this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

For sovereigns, alternatives to dollar-denominated assets might include a commodity-based standard, where surpluses are recycled into essential commodities like oil, gold, or grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. This allows countries to maintain competitive advantages while reducing reliance on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. For retail investors, potential safe havens include real estate in jurisdictions with strong property rights and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. However, these alternatives are not ideal due to issues of liquidity and movability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

### The Role of Cryptocurrencies and CBDCs

Cryptocurrencies are viewed as "quite a dangerous asset" due to anticipated regulation and competition with government-issued currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a central bankers' forum, explicitly views Bitcoin as speculative and anticipates governments moving towards Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. The expectation is that the U.S. will regulate private cryptocurrencies and then issue its own CBDC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. While some argue there's no inherent need for a U.S. digital currency, the decision ultimately hinges on politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. The increasing [[global_economic_and_geopolitical_risks|instability]] and potential bifurcation in the world paradoxically lead to an appreciation for the dollar's inherent strengths, such as U.S. military power, geography, and self-sufficiency, as a safe haven, despite the actions taken against Russian assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

## Overall Outlook: Increased Volatility and Social Disorder

The current environment suggests a high likelihood of "crazy policy choices" that were previously unimaginable, such as governments shutting down economies and providing "free money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. These erratic policies are expected to be fiscally irresponsible, potentially including actions like forgiving student loans for political gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. The increased unpredictability in both electoral and popular voting stages, as seen in the French election demographics, contributes to this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.

### Fragility of the Financial System

The current financial system is deemed "very fragile" because attempts to smooth the business cycle with limited tools and an incomplete mandate have prevented minor crises, leading to much larger, brewing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. Historically, crises serve a purpose: they allow learning and enforce consequences for poor performance, maintaining balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>. Removing this feedback mechanism, as facilitated by institutions like the Federal Reserve, creates moral hazard and makes the system increasingly fragile until a major breakdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

The U.S. system, initially designed to make law-passing difficult to prevent corruption, did not envision the rise of a financialized central bank with global importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Key Fed personnel are insulated and unaccountable, holding extreme power, which, while enabling quick reactions during crises, means mistakes like the recent inflation call have no accountability mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

### Political Disorder

A major concern for the [[future_economic_challenges_and_crises|future economic challenges and crises]] is the growing political disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. The inability of a "breaking" system to receive adequate information to fix itself further entrenches this fracturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. The increasing division within countries, where large segments of the population fundamentally disagree on basic values and even the legitimacy of elections, creates a real risk of social disorder and even national fragmentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.

### Real Economy Distress

The global fragmentation also opens the door to real economic distress not seen in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. A system designed for efficiency, not resilience, is vulnerable to breakdowns in global supply chains, energy, and mineral flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>. Such breakdowns could lead to significantly higher prices and potentially even starvation in poorer countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

### Treasury Market Concerns

Beyond broader geopolitical and social trends, specific [[risks_and_opportunities_in_financial_markets|risks and opportunities in financial markets]] include watching the Treasury market very closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. Historically high amounts of issuance are anticipated, and there is concern that the underlying "plumbing" of the financial system—financing and balance sheet capacity—may not be wide enough to support it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>. This could lead to discontinuities similar to the repo market issues seen a few years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

These factors combine to suggest the coming years will be "tremendously interesting and tremendously eventful," marking a significant bull market for volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>. The broader implication is that some basic assumptions about [[global_financial_stability_risks|global financial stability risks]] are being undermined, making what happens in markets potentially less significant than [[global_economic_and_financial_challenges|global economic and financial challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

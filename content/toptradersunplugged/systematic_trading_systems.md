[[Systematic trading strategies | Systematic trading systems]] are a method of trading based on predefined rules and quantitative methods rather than discretionary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This approach is rooted in mathematical modeling and simulations to understand underlying market processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Tushar Chande, co-founder and head of research at Rowe Asset Management, is an author on the topic of designing [[rulebased_trading_strategies | rule-based trading systems]] and has over 20 years of experience actively trading these systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. He emphasizes the unique insight required to design and run a successful [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

## Background and Philosophy

Tushar Chande's background in engineering, including a PhD in a high-powered R&D environment, involved extensive mathematical modeling and simulations to describe and predict processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This training naturally led him to use quantitative methods and embrace a [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic approach]] to problem-solving in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. While engineering often deals with cause-and-effect relationships, Chande found markets to be fundamentally random, with no simple cause-and-effect governing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. Despite this randomness, he was intrigued by the ability to be original through research and find rules that allowed for a different reaction to market movements than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Chande has published numerous articles and written several books on the subject, including "Beyond Technical Analysis," which has been translated into multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## Rowe Asset Management's Alus Program

The Alus program, managed by Rowe Asset Management, began in November 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. As of the interview, it manages approximately $40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. The program is a medium-term [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. It aims to emulate discretionary traders by capturing various types of market behavior within a single program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

### Organizational Structure
Rowe Asset Management is based in Zurich, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. The company has implemented a high level of automation for day-to-day trading, reconciliation, back office, and record-keeping processes, adhering to regulatory standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Key functions such as research, trading, software development, and client relations are kept in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. Functions like administration, accounting, legal, and compliance are partly or fully outsourced to gain third-party assessment and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

### Capacity
The Alus program's capacity is estimated to be well in excess of a billion US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. At that point, the program may need to add more systems or refine execution to manage slippage and maintain profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

### Performance and Expectations
The program's performance has differed significantly after 2009 compared to before, generally performing as designed within the challenging macro environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. Similar to Formula 1 cars needing optimal conditions or golfers performing best in perfect weather, [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] are highly optimized for certain market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. The period after 2009, following the credit crisis and the Lehman Brothers collapse, presented an "unusually difficult" trading environment for diversified trend followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

Markets before 2007-2008 typically offered years of strong trends after weak periods, allowing for recovery and new equity highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. After 2009, most trends were limited to equity and bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. Diversified traders like Alus, which do not overweight specific sectors, faced more challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. Rowe Asset Management's "Trend Barometer" showed that for more than two-thirds of the months since inception, market trends have been "below break even," indicating a tough environment for trend-following programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.

It is important to note that [[longterm_trading_systems | long-term trading systems]] and track records often evolve, with managers making changes to systems, market rates, and portfolio weights over time due to research, client demand, and market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. For the Alus program, there have been roughly two distinct periods, with significant changes made in late 2010/early 2011 based on observations from 2009 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

### Key Statistics (as of interview)
*   **Average Fee Structure**: Close to the industry benchmark of 2% management fee and 20% incentive fee (2/20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.
*   **Commissions**: Approximately $10 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.
*   **Maximum Drawdown**: 22%, occurring in February 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>. This is consistent with the rule of thumb that the worst drawdown is typically four times the monthly standard deviation (Alus's monthly standard deviation is about 5.1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. This indicates good risk control even in difficult environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:00">[23:27:00]</a>.
*   **Offense Defense Ratio**: 1.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. This ratio is calculated by dividing the average winning month (4.65%) by the average losing month (3.42%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>. A ratio greater than one indicates the system responds well to opportunities and reduces risk during adverse conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Winning Months**: Approximately 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>.

## Trading Program Design

The Alus program is a medium-term [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

### Markets and Diversification
The program trades 44 markets, ensuring high diversification across all major sectors with roughly similar weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>
*   Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:00">[27:15:00]</a>
*   Interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:00">[27:19:00]</a>
*   Equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:21:00">[27:21:00]</a>
*   Commodities (more than half of the markets traded, indicating a commodities orientation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>

The core benefit of a CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) program, according to Rowe Asset Management, is to offset significant, prolonged declines (one month to six months or more) in equity and bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>. This positions CTAs as a form of "portfolio insurance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.

### System Groups
The Alus program utilizes six systems, grouped into three main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>:
1.  **Groups 1 and 2**: Primarily [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] systems that buy strength and sell weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a>. They are designed with specific entry, exit, and initial risk parameters to differentiate their performance profile from other trend followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:31:00">[29:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Group 3**: Serves as a counterweight to groups 1 and 2, reinforcing the portfolio offset function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>.

A key principle is using the same rules across all markets, promoting robustness and avoiding market-specific systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. This contrasts with discretionary traders who might use market-specific information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:00]</a>.

### Design Choices
*   **Trend Identification**: The systems primarily use **breakout style systems** rather than moving average crossover systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Reasoning**: Breakout systems help avoid trading during narrow, consolidating price ranges, where moving average systems tend to generate many unprofitable signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>.
    *   Breakout systems also allow for more creative definition of entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:00">[34:48:00]</a>.
*   **Winning Trade Percentage**: A significant design feature is the focus on achieving a higher percentage of winning trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:00">[35:16:00]</a>. While typical trend-following systems may have 30-35% profitable trades, Alus's systems aim for 45-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:30:00">[35:30:00]</a>. This is achieved by combining the breakout strategy with a small number of conditions (1-3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Management**:
    *   Breakout systems lead to a discontinuous equity curve with fewer positions when markets are not trending, and a larger number when trends are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. This differs from moving average systems, which often maintain continuous positions across many markets, leading to more stable, but potentially less reactive, equity curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>.
    *   Risk control is embedded in the design process, with the number of positions not being constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>.
    *   Initial risk levels at the market and system level are determined through long-term simulations of the system, combining with the total standard deviation of simulated returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>.
    *   All rules for position sizing and risk control are automated within their Integrated Trading Platform (ITP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:00">[41:35:00]</a>.

### Operational Aspects
*   **Data Inputs**: The models only require daily price data: open, high, low, and close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:00">[37:57:00]</a>. They do not rely on fundamental data, other data sources, or multiple contract data for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.
*   **Execution Frequency**: The Alus program operates as an "end-of-day trader," meaning the model is run once daily after trading closes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>. This contrasts with intraday traders or systems that might react to mid-day crossovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>.
*   **Order Types**:
    *   Primarily uses **stop orders** for trade execution, meaning trades occur when prices exceed or fall below a specific stop level or price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:00">[39:24:00]</a>.
    *   Uses **spread orders** for rolling over positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:00">[39:10:00]</a>.
    *   Occasionally uses **market orders** for entering/exiting positions (e.g., for new accounts or trading errors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>.
*   **Position Sizing**: The chosen approach is "all in or all out," meaning the entire position is put on or taken off at or as close to a single price point as possible, rather than scaling into positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.

The concept of "fourth turnings" describes periods of societal upheaval and conflict that redefine a nation. These periods are characterized by significant societal shifts, which inherently impact economic landscapes and necessitate adapted [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape|investment strategies]].

## Characteristics of a Fourth Turning's Economic Landscape

A "fourth turning" is a time of "exceptional upheaval and conflict" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Historically, these periods have included events like the Great Depression and World War II, the American Civil War, and the American Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. They are often initiated by a "catalyst" â€“ a "huge event which discredits existing institutions and their ability to provide security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008, for example, is identified as such a catalyst, similar to the Black Thursday crash of 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Financial crashes have historically correlated with the timing of these fourth turnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

During a fourth turning, society experiences extreme loss of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The prevailing mood shifts from individualism to a yearning for order and community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

Key economic and societal changes observed in fourth turnings include:
*   **Shift in public mood**: From individualism to a desire for community and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **Increased government intervention**: Governments become more "aggressive in their control of markets and their willingness to Marshal resources even private resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.
*   **Economic equality**: There's a movement from privilege to equality, not just in income and wealth, but in social ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. This often involves the "devaluation of assets or the confiscation or a distraction of assets by the plutocrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: Governments accrue "huge liabilities" that cannot be paid through current taxation, leading to significant borrowing. Inflation becomes "one of the ways of getting out from under those liabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. This makes "nominal fixed income assets very problematic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>.
*   **Fiscal triage**: With high public liabilities, there's an expectation of "triage," where certain promises, particularly fiscal ones, may be "given up" by older generations to regain moral authority and enable the younger generation to stabilize the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>.

## Investment Implications and Generational Attitudes

Periods of upheaval are a "challenging stage for people who have wealth and Investments to kind of protect that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a>.

During these times, different generations display distinct attitudes towards risk and security:
*   **Boomers**: This generation is described as "very Cavalier about risk-taking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>, preferring defined contribution plans over defined benefit plans, and often maintaining individualistic tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
*   **Millennials**: In contrast, Millennials "crave order" and "social guarantees," showing a low tolerance for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Their "peer orientation" is evident in their [[systematic_investment_strategies|investment strategies]], such as "crowd investing" in target-date ETFs tied to indices like the S&P 500. This approach suggests a preference to "go down with their peers and be left behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. They also show a turning away from traditional democracy towards more direct, immediate solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Generation X (Nomads)**: This generation, often characterized as "cynical, pragmatic survivalist[s]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>, will be making key decisions during the crisis, motivated by the Millennials' desire for order and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.

## The Outcome: Rebirth and New Institutions

Despite the turmoil, a society that successfully navigates a fourth turning "emerges reborn, more equal, more optimistic, and more united" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This rebirth leads to the establishment of "new institutions" and a "new common Republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Problems that seem "unimaginable" to solve at the height of the fourth turning can be resolved rapidly in the subsequent "first turning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.

This period leads to significant societal transformations, characterized by:
*   **Community over Individualism**: A shift back towards collective identity and purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **Equality**: A more egalitarian society, moving away from privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
*   **Authority**: People tend to trust and follow experts and leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.
*   **Permanent Solutions**: A focus on long-term investment in infrastructure and institutions to prevent future problems, rather than merely deferring social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>. The creation of institutions like the UN, IMF, and World Bank after World War II exemplifies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:13">[01:12:13]</a>.

As Neil Howe notes, "we never solve our biggest problems... on bright sunny days when everyone feels comfortable. We always do it on dark stormy nights when our backs are against the wall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. This suggests that the intense pressure of a fourth turning is precisely what drives the necessary transformations and the creation of a new, more robust societal structure.

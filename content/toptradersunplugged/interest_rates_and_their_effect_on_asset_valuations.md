The cost of money, or [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rates]], is considered the most important factor influencing asset valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. A strong economy with high output and sales for companies can still coincide with poor performance of equity markets and assets at large if interest rates are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. This concept is often counterintuitive to many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

## Historical Context and Market Dynamics
A notable period for understanding the [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets | impact of rising interest rates on markets]] is from 1968 to 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. During this 14-year span, interest rates showed a sustained upward trend, and the stock market experienced zero nominal returns, with a 67% decline in real terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Concurrently, GDP grew above trend in real terms, highlighting the disconnect between economic strength and asset returns in a rising rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

Two primary drivers explain why asset performance can be poor even in a strong economy with rising interest rates:
1.  **Multiple Contraction** If a 10-year bond offers a 20% yield, investors are unlikely to pay a 25 P/E (price-to-earnings) multiple for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The PE multiple was around 25 in 1968 and collapsed to 4.5 by 1982, reflecting the shift in earnings yield expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.
2.  **Margin Contraction** Corporate margins were at record highs in 1968, similar to recent periods, but collapsed by 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. This suggests that if [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates continue to go higher]] for a secular period, margin contraction is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>.

## Hedging Challenges and Market Position
Currently, [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | bond markets in Europe]] are weak, with the UK hitting particularly high yields and France also facing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The S&P US Treasury bond index for 20-year or more maturity was down 1.88% even before recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The environment for hedging [[impact_of_shortterm_interest_rates_on_investments | interest rate risk]] has become significantly more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.
*   When the yield curve was inverted, it was possible to get paid to hedge against interest rate inflation risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. This opportunity, however, was not widely seized upon, as many believed the market indicated it wouldn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
*   Now, the curve is upward sloping, making hedging increasingly difficult and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.
*   A significant portion of investors, including seasoned professionals, mistakenly believe equities act as a hedge against structural inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of asset behavior during such times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

There is substantial "quote demand" for entities to buy back if bond prices continue to rise, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. Many entities are leveraged with bond exposure, and there's too much exposure relative to what the market can handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. This situation suggests that more "pain" (losses) is likely to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

## Structural Changes and Inflationary Feedback
With 40 years of declining interest rates, most current portfolio managers have not experienced a sustained period of rising rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>. This [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | recency bias]] influences their expectations and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. For instance, some bond managers present callable bonds as having short effective durations, but this changes dramatically if yields rise, removing the call option and extending duration significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

The increase in interest rates also creates a feedback loop to inflation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. Higher interest rates, as the cost of money, drive up the cost of goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>. Furthermore, rising inflation expectations lead people to pull forward demand, purchasing inventory and locking up goods, which further fuels inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. This non-linear relationship can become exponential as the trend gains momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. The record issuing of corporate bonds (estimated $200 billion in January) could suggest companies are trying to borrow before rates rise further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

Mahendra Sharma, founder of Mahendra Prophecy Publications, is a financial astrologer known for his accurate market predictions based on planetary movements and cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>. He emphasizes that while astrology charts and planetary movements are consistent, their interpretation varies greatly among individuals, influenced by their own "astro time cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>. Sharma dedicates approximately eight hours daily to studying astro cycles, researching historical market data to find correlations between planetary movements and market trends, aiming for over 95% accuracy in medium to longer-term predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

## Methodology

Sharma's approach to financial astrology involves studying 12 zodiac houses, nine planets (in Vedic astrology), and 27 Nakshatras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[02:10:00]</a>. He looks for patterns and similarities in market behavior over long periods, such as a hundred-year chart, to identify when certain planetary movements lead to specific market outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

### Wave of Nature Theory
Sharma developed the "Wave of Nature" theory to understand how the majority of people will think and act in financial markets, influenced by planetary positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. This theory incorporates elements similar to [[The Role of Behavioral Finance in Markets | behavioral finance in trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>:
*   Planets influence people's minds and intellect (e.g., Moon controls mind, Mercury controls intellect, Sun controls soul, Jupiter influences spirituality and money matters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>.
*   When the "astro combinations" of influential people align positively, they may start acting and communicating positively, creating a "wave" that the masses follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>.
*   For an instrument, if its astro chart is positive, it attracts people, leading to increased investment and higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:00">[22:50:00]</a>. Conversely, a negative astro chart may lead people to refuse to believe in an instrument's potential, causing them to lose money if they short it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00:00">[23:00:00]</a>.

## Past Predictions and Their Accuracy

Sharma highlights several notable predictions:
*   **USSR Collapse (1991):** Predicted the collapse of the USSR within five days of arriving in Kenya in 1991, which happened 36 hours later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Bubble (1995-2000):** Predicted a huge technological bubble in 1995-1996, recommending investment in technology, software, and internet stocks. He then accurately predicted the crash of these stocks in early 2000, advising people to exit their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.
*   **Commodity Era and Dollar Fall (2001):** In his 2001 book, he predicted the start of the commodity era and the fall of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. He forecasted gold going to $1800 and silver to $50, which attracted significant attention in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **[[2023 Financial Market Analysis and Trends | Global Financial Crisis]] (2008):** Accurately predicted the fall in the global equity market, financial stocks, and banking stocks in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Market Bottom and Dow Target (2009):** Predicted on CNBC that the market would bottom out on March 5, 2009, and that the Dow would reach 32,000. He continued to recommend staying long in the market from 2009, calling it "one of the most beautiful bull markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. The Dow was close to 32,000 at the time of the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **2020 Market [[Volatility in financial markets | Volatility]] and Rebound:** Though he did not explicitly predict COVID-19, he had written an article ten years prior about a "drastic or the worst diseases coming on this planet" that would change people's lives and be an "event of century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. For the financial markets, he predicted extreme [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] and a drastic fall between February 16 and March 22, 2020, followed by a major rally from March 22 onwards until the end of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>. These predictions for the market proved "so accurate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.
*   **Tesla (2018):** In 2018, he stated that if Elon Musk survived July 2018 financially, Tesla would become one of the most important and richest companies, with Elon Musk becoming one of the top five richest men. He recommended aggressive investment in Tesla, predicting a 10-100 fold increase from its struggling price of around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.

*   **Valuations:** Investors should be careful when saying stocks are expensive, as the world is changing rapidly, requiring a revision of valuation methods for the equity market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>.
*   **Market Strategy:** Focus on medium to longer-term investments rather than short-term speculation to create wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Bear Market:** A traditional, prolonged bear market is not expected very soon, possibly 3-4 years away, and it will mark the end of the current bullish era, with markets possibly remaining sideways for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:26:00">[43:26:00]</a>.

### Specific Stock Recommendations
*   **Medical Device Stocks:** One of the "golden eggs," highly recommended for portfolios due to a "beautiful era" coming for the next 10 years, where these stocks can significantly outperform the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Areas:** Still recommends technology and biotech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:02:00">[33:02:02]</a>.
*   **Tesla:** Short-term [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] is not a concern. Next target for Tesla is $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>.
*   **Amazon:** May go to $10,000 in the next three to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>.
*   **Electric Car Company Stocks:** Investors need to be careful with sharply rising electric car company stocks, picking the right stocks at the right price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>.

### European Equity Market
*   Europe is expected to follow the USA market trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.
*   A "big economy recovery" is coming, with the next three to three and a half years being a "fantastic time" for European equities, with investors making a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:06:00">[37:06:00]</a>.

### Currencies
*   **Dollar Index:** Expected to bottom out around 91, and not go below 89.11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:22:00">[52:22:00]</a>. The dollar will experience [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]], with sharp gains and falls, not a one-sided trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:53:00">[52:53:00]</a>.
*   **Emerging Market Currencies:** Mexican Peso and South African Rand have performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:24:00">[53:24:00]</a>.
*   **Brazilian Real:** Recommended as one of the "best currencies to invest" in 2021, with potential to gain 25-30% against the dollar and pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>.
*   **Euro:** Predicted in 2015 that a crisis might come in 2024 (previously 2023), potentially marking the "end of the European Union or Euro deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:52:00">[55:52:00]</a>. In 2024, people need to be "very very careful" about the currency they hold, as the Euro could lose 40-50% of its value, affecting the real estate and global equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>. This points to a potential "complete breakdown of trust in government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36:00">[51:36:00]</a>.

### Interest Rates
*   After 2024, interest rates are predicted to "go to the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:00">[50:20:00]</a>.
*   Interestingly, gold is also predicted to go higher alongside rising interest rates, a correlation that economists and analysts may find difficult to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>.

### Commodities
*   **2020:** Energy market underperformed, while metals performed very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:58:00">[56:58:00]</a>.
*   **2021:** Grains are expected to outperform, and metals will also perform well but with high [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]], advising traders to take profit on sharp rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:13:00">[57:13:00]</a>. Energy (oil) will struggle to cross $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:19:00">[57:19:00]</a>.
*   **Soft Commodities:** Specifically likes coffee and cocoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:28:00">[57:28:00]</a>.
*   **Grains:** Recommends buying soybean and wheat due to anticipated weather problems in Australia and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:43:00">[57:43:00]</a>.

### Gold
*   **Short-term:** Gold is expected to bottom out around $1840 and then move towards $2375 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:53:00">[45:53:00]</a>. Silver may go to $38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>. Mining stocks are also expected to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>.
*   **Platinum:** Looks "fantastic" in 2021, with potential to gain 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:18:00">[46:18:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term:** The bullish cycle for gold is predicted to continue until 2051 and end in 2052. Around 2050-2052, gold prices may move sharply higher due to economic or other global crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>.
*   **Future Role:** Governments might impose restrictions or policies regarding gold (e.g., surrendering gold) or gold may eventually become a currency, especially from 2028 onwards, playing a key role, potentially "far better than cryptocurrency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:11:00">[47:11:00]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)
*   Sharma strongly advises against selling or shorting Bitcoin currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>.
*   A "major" event is expected around February 20, 2021. The week between February 20 and 27, 2021, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.
*   **Scenario 1 (Crash):** If Bitcoin fails to move higher during that week, it will crash drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2 (Higher):** If Bitcoin keeps moving higher between February 20 and 27, it may test $45,000-$50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Investment:** He does not recommend investing "hard-earned money" in Bitcoin for now, suggesting gold or Amazon as safer alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>.
*   **Right Time for Crypto:** The "right time" for cryptocurrency as a viable investment and for central banks to introduce their own digital currencies will be around 2026-2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:33">[01:03:33]</a>.

### [[Volatility in financial markets | Market Volatility]]
*   Expected to increase in early 2021, particularly in the first quarter (first five weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>.
*   Traders should be careful, remain sidelined if markets behave abnormally, or consider a [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] index in their portfolio if holding stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:40">[01:05:40]</a>.

### [[Geopolitical influences on financial markets | Geopolitical Events]]
*   Sharma generally avoids political predictions, but notes that the market would move higher regardless of the US election outcome, advising investors to stay long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.
*   **Post-2024 Concerns:** People need to be "very, very careful" after 2024, as "some serious issues" and a lot of things will come to the real world, causing shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.
*   **Natural Disasters:** Significant natural disasters are predicted between 2026 and 2030, potentially disturbing the whole world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a>.

Sharma advises those who profit from his predictions to engage in charity and help needy people, emphasizing the importance of respecting nature and humanity over religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>.

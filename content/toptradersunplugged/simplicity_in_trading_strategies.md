Andreas believes that [[the_importance_of_simple_and_objective_trading_rules | simplicity in trading strategies]] is paramount. Adding complexity without commensurate payment is not worthwhile, as it makes execution more difficult and increases the likelihood of over-optimization, potentially leading to a model that only works due to being perfectly fitted to recent past data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Focus on Broad Concepts Over Details

[[systematic_trading_strategies | Normal systematic strategies]], excluding high-frequency trading, are generally about trading broader concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Andreas observes that retail traders often fixate on minuscule details that don't significantly impact outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. For example, when discussing how to measure a trend—whether to use an exponential, simple, or weighted moving average—Andreas states, "I don't really care what's going to be the difference in the end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. He argues that striving for perfection in such details is a misconception, as perfection isn't necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

This focus on intricate details often stems from the technical analysis (TA) school, where people learn about hundreds of indicators and their various settings, leading to attempts at over-optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. However, institutional traders do not typically combine ten indicators to find a perfect buying signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. Instead, they identify a market phenomenon they wish to exploit and seek a good way to trade that style, rather than the "best possible strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## The Value of Simple Systems

Andreas contends that "the simpler systems are usually the better ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Complexity should only be added if it is significantly compensated for, as otherwise, it becomes a liability that makes execution harder and risks over-optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

In his first book, *Following the Trend*, Andreas aimed to create a very simple [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]] model to generally describe the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. His "biggest regret" is that he didn't make it even simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He later realized, through a suggestion from his friend Nicklas at Quest, that he could have used an even simpler model: the "12-month momentum rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.

### The 12-Month Momentum Rule

This [[rulebased_trading_strategies | rule-based trading strategy]] is extremely simple:
*   It looks at two data points: the current price and the price one year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.
*   If the current price is higher than a year ago, the system goes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   If the current price is lower than a year ago, it goes short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

This simple model, when applied to a diversified basket of futures, could yield results similar to, or even better than, more complex models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. Key assumptions for its success include trading a broad universe of 50 to 100 different futures markets and implementing a [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] parity model for risk allocation and position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>.

Despite its simplicity, this model has a significant downside: it's in all markets at all times, leading to a very high level of [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | equity volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. However, it serves as an excellent learning tool and a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. If one's own trading rules cannot outperform this simple model, it suggests a potential problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

## Simplicity in Trend Following

Andreas emphasizes that while the concept and rules of [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]] are often simple and easy to implement in simulations, real-world execution and combining multiple models with risk management are more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. He notes that the return dispersion among experienced [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic and trend following managers]] is rising, suggesting that even simple strategies require careful management and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Ultimately, Andreas advocates for focusing on a phenomenon to exploit in a strategy, rather than striving for theoretical perfection that often leads to over-optimized and brittle systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

The [[impact_of_monetary_policy_and_qe_on_markets | impact of monetary policy]] on markets is a critical area of discussion, particularly concerning the actions of central banks and their ripple effects on the economy and various asset classes. Economist and policy advisor William White has warned about the negative economic [[impact_of_financial_systems_and_monetary_policy_on_society | impact of central bank policies]] after the Great Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Recent Central Bank Actions and Market Reactions
In a recent week, Chairman Powell made it clear that the ultimate level of [[interest_rates_and_monetary_policy | interest rates]] would be higher and for a longer duration than previously expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Futures markets now anticipate fed funds staying above 5% for the entirety of 2023, a significant shift from September's expectations of a U-turn before reaching 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Initially, a publicized leak hinted at a 75 basis point Fed funds rate hike, with another similar hike in December being less certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indeed raised rates by 75 basis points and included a new sentence in their statement: "in determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This may acknowledge that policy changes operate with a lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

However, Chairman Powell's hawkish tone at the post-meeting press conference quickly led bond traders to drive rates higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   May 2023 Fed funds futures, which had rallied to 4.805% on the day of the leak, reversed and closed the week at 5.12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Similarly, the two-year note violently reversed its recent low of 4.3% to finish the week at roughly 4.71%, marking the year's high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

This hawkish stance might have been influenced by an advance copy of the employment report, which showed no signs of a moderating economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The report revealed 233,000 jobs added (outpacing 200,000 expected), rising hourly earnings, and an unexpected jump of 1 million unfilled job openings to 10.7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. While rising [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rates]] are impacting the auto and home sectors, robust demand for workers and rising wages appear to be offsetting that effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Broader Considerations for Policy Impact
The period from 1982 until recently saw the traditional 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) perform exceptionally well because inflation and [[interest_rates_and_monetary_policy | interest rates]] were falling, which also led to equities being re-rated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:35">[01:02:35]</a>. This secular trend flattered the performance of traditional portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.

*   Equity PE ratios rose from about 9 in September 1982 to around 20, contributing an average annual return of 2% in equities due to this re-rating effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>.
*   For US 10-year bonds, the adjustment reduced the average return by about a third, making the secular trend a more significant component of returns due to their lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.

Adjusting for these secular trends, which are unlikely to continue (especially with recent breaks), suggests that the relative attractiveness of trend following strategies compared to traditional 60/40 portfolios increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:47">[01:05:47]</a>. If future market conditions do not benefit from the same long-term drift in equities and bonds as seen over the last 40 years, allocating more capital to strategies like trend following becomes even more compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:10">[01:06:10]</a>.

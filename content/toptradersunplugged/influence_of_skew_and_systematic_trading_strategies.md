Nick Baltas, a managing director at Goldman Sachs with extensive research and practical experience in the [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investment space]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:43">[01:42:43]</a>, has explored various aspects of [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]], including the impact and implications of "skew" on market returns.

## Understanding Skew in Trading

Skew, in the context of trading, refers to the asymmetry of an asset's return distribution. Nick Baltas and his co-authors conducted research for a U.S. public pension, exploring skew as a predictor of future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:03">[04:47:03]</a>.

### Realized Skewness
The research primarily focused on *realized skewness*, which involves looking back over a recent period (e.g., a year, six, or nine months) to estimate the asymmetry of daily currency distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:31">[04:47:31]</a>.

### Observed Phenomenon
A key finding was that negatively skewed commodities tend to outperform less negatively or positively skewed commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:23">[04:47:23]</a>. This means that assets that have historically experienced more frequent or pronounced negative price movements ("negative tails") tend to perform better subsequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:51">[04:47:51]</a>.

### Explanations for the Skew Premium
Several theoretical and behavioral explanations are proposed for why this "skew premium" might exist:

*   **Preference for Lottery Tickets**: There's a tendency for investors, particularly in the retail market, to prefer assets that resemble "lottery tickets"â€”those with an occasional, rare, but significant upward move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:31">[04:48:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:51">[04:48:51]</a>. This excess demand leads to overbuying, driving up their prices and consequently lowering their expected future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>. Short-sale constraints can also contribute to this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:14">[04:49:14]</a>.

*   **Cumulative Prospect Theory**: Based on the work of Tversky, this theory suggests that human beings tend to associate small probability events with a higher probability of occurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:01">[04:50:01]</a>. This means they might perceive rare large upward or downward moves as more frequent than they actually are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:07">[04:50:07]</a>. This perception can lead to an overvaluation of positively skewed assets and an undervaluation of negatively skewed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:28">[04:50:28]</a>.

*   **Selective Hedging**: From a risk management perspective, agents may choose not to hedge their entire exposure if an asset they are hedging has a tendency to go up more often in a tail scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:59">[05:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:04">[05:14:04]</a>. This behavior from producers (shorting less) or consumers (over-hedging) can contribute to observed price patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:55">[05:20:55]</a>.

### Application Across Markets
Given evidence of skew's influence in single stocks and commodity futures, research has extended to other markets like Foreign Exchange (FX), bonds, and equity indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. While FX showed less statistical significance, cross-asset skew strategies generally yield strong results, particularly for bonds and equity indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:53">[05:51:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:01">[05:58:01]</a>. This can be viewed as an inter-temporal risk transfer between market participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:18">[05:22:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:32">[05:27:32]</a>.

## Skew and Systematic Trading Strategies

The discussion on skew highlights how specific market dynamics and behavioral biases can lead to quantifiable premiums that [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] can aim to harvest. Unlike traditional trend following, which is a price-taker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a> and relies on sustained price movements, a skew-based strategy identifies mispricing due to non-rational market behavior or hedging needs.

While [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] typically focus on trend following, mean reversion, or carry, the research on skew suggests another dimension for systematic capture of returns. This type of premium is distinct from trend following but can blend nicely with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:08">[05:48:08]</a>, contributing to overall diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:08">[05:05:08]</a>.

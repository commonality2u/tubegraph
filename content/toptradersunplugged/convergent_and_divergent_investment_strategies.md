Investment strategies can be broadly categorized into two philosophical approaches: convergent and divergent. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for assessing risk-taking and portfolio construction, as they are based on fundamentally different beliefs about how markets and the world operate. This framework helps to understand the "why" behind an [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment strategy]] rather than just the "how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Convergent Strategies

A convergent risk-taking approach stems from a view of the world as stable, somewhat dependable, and reliant on symbiosis or equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

*   **Beliefs**: Proponents of convergent strategies believe that economic data (like GDP) and market indicators lead to predictable outcomes, such as interest rate cuts, based on an assumption of a stable equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. They assume that things will eventually revert to a mean or expected state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking Approach**:
    *   When winning: Confirms their initial belief ("I was right") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
    *   When losing: They tend to "double down," believing that the market will revert to their expected outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. They take profits when they believe they are right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Return Profile**: Characterized by lots of small wins, but occasionally, when they are significantly wrong, they experience big negative losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   A person who stays within a close-knit social group and nurtures existing relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
    *   [[investment_strategies_and_risks | Investment strategies]] that rely on a belief in a stable market equilibrium or predictable economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
    *   March 2023 banking system issues where participants added leverage to what they thought was not risky, but turned out to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Divergent Strategies

A divergent risk-taking approach operates with the view that the world is non-deterministic, very random, and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It involves accepting the "unknowable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

*   **Beliefs**: They do not predict market movements but react to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. They believe the world is changing and are prepared to follow new trends wherever they emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taking Approach**:
    *   When losing: They cut losses and move on, acknowledging they don't know what will happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
    *   When winning: They let profits run, recognizing that they have identified something exciting and continue to follow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Return Profile**: Characterized by lots of small losses, with occasional large wins when they capture significant unexpected moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   A "social butterfly" who constantly makes new connections, potentially leading to new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
    *   [[systematic_investment_strategies | Systematic investment strategies]] like Trend Following are archetypal divergent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Trend Following as a Divergent Strategy

[[Systematic investment strategies | Trend following]] is a prime example of a divergent [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment strategy]] because it systematically cuts losses when markets do not move in the direction of the trend and allows profits to run when trends increase, regardless of any underlying belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

*   **Behavior in Different Market Conditions**:
    *   **Divergent World**: Trend following thrives when the world is "divergent" â€“ meaning things change in unexpected and unpredictable ways (e.g., geopolitical crises, pandemics, sudden inflation spikes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Convergent World**: It struggles when the world is "convergent" and markets are consolidating or returning to perceived "normal" conditions, leading to false starts and frequent small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. 2023 was largely seen as a convergent year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **"Pure Trend"**: A "pure trend" strategy is considered purely divergent, as it uses market price movements as the sole basis for position sizing, avoiding the incorporation of any convergent beliefs (e.g., from carry signals or other strategies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   Historically, "pure trend" following has been most effective in reacting to and profiting from unpredictable market dislocations and crises, earning the term "crisis alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Why the Distinction Matters

Understanding the difference between convergent and divergent strategies is critical for [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | diversification in investment strategies]] and risk management:

*   **Complementary Return Profiles**: Convergent strategies offer small, frequent gains, while divergent strategies offer infrequent but large gains that can offset losses from unexpected events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   **Crisis Resilience**: Divergent strategies, particularly pure trend following, tend to perform well when convergent views are challenged during market crises (e.g., COVID-19, Ukraine conflict, inflation surges) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. In 2022, trend following was one of the few [[investment_strategies_and_risks | hedge fund strategies]] that performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Hidden Risks**: The greatest risk often comes from what one believes *not* to be risky, especially when combined with leverage. This highlights the danger of overly convergent philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Current Market Relevance

The market environment in 2023 was marked by consolidation and a return to some "normalcy" after the volatility of previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. However, key empirical data points suggest that conditions are not fully "back to normal":

*   **Fixed Income Volatility**: Still 50% higher than pre-2020 stationary levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Stock-Bond Correlations**: Remain positive, indicating a different regime for fixed income compared to the "Great Moderation" period before COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Looking back to the 1960s and 1970s, higher bond volatility and positive stock-bond correlations were prevalent, suggesting the current environment might not be merely transitory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This shift challenges the long-held assumption of negative stock-bond correlation that underpinned strategies like risk parity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

As of early 2024, there is no strong conviction in either direction in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Market participants are waiting for clear signals, such as interest rate cuts, which are widely anticipated but may lead to a "bumpy landing" rather than a smooth one due to potential volatility in inflation and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This environment emphasizes the need for [[investment_strategy_divergence | investment strategy divergence]] and the ability to adapt to changing market conditions.

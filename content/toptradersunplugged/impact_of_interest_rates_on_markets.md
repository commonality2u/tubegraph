This article explores the [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets | impact of interest rates on markets]], drawing insights from a conversation with Jim Kassang on the Systematic Investor Series. It delves into how monetary policy, inflation, and market structure influence market behavior.

## Current Market Overview
Recently, Federal Reserve officials have been actively speaking, with St. Louis President James Bullard raising his projection for the Fed funds rate to between 5.20% and 5.25%, up from a previous range of 4.75% to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Bullard emphasized this as a "minimal level" and has been an influential hawkish member of the FOMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Despite these hawkish remarks, yields decreased, and U.S. mortgage rates saw their largest weekly decline in 41 years, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to 6.61% from 7.08% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

[[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | Interest rate expectations]] are currently a primary driver of market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Cyclical vs. Secular Inflation
A key distinction in understanding [[inflations_impact_on_markets | inflation's impact on markets]] and interest rates is between cyclical and secular inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. For the past 40 years, these two have often been conflated, with short-term cyclical effects dominating due to a secular trend of disinflation, leading to [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_markets | monetary policy dominance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The bond market, heavily influenced by cyclical effects, has been "very wrong for over a year now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

The secular effects suggest that long-term yields remain low, even if there's a short-term cyclical disinflationary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The current inverted yield curve, while typically signaling a reset, doesn't necessarily imply disinflation during a secular inflationary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Markets could experience a "stagflationary environment" with increasing longer-term inflation alongside a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Historical Context: The 1970s
Looking back at the 1970s, which was a period of significant [[inflations_impact_on_markets | inflationary pressure]] (1965-1985), Jim highlights several points:
*   **1969-1970 Recession**: Inflation went from 6-6.5% down to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. To achieve this, the Fed funds rate rose from 3.5-4% to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. This recession was shallow and was followed by fiscal responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **1973-1975 Recession**: Inflation surged from 3% to 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. The Fed funds rate, after declining, increased up to 14% to combat this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. Despite a deep recession, inflation eventually dropped to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. However, it later surged to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. This demonstrates how floors for interest rates kept rising, and perceptions of "beating inflation" were often premature within a broader inflationary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

Currently, despite a broad inflationary push, the U.S. has been able to export inflation due to a significantly stronger dollar and slowdowns outside the U.S. (e.g., China shutdowns, Europe's slowing economies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. However, a declining dollar and China's reopening could lead to imported inflation and higher commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Impact of Interest Rates on Equities
During secular inflationary periods, equities tend to have less upside drift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. This is counterintuitive, as one might expect inflation to drive nominal asset prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. However, "second-order effects" of inflation significantly influence this:
*   **Reduced Long-Term Volatility**: While seemingly paradoxical, inflation can reduce *long-term* downside volatility in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. This is because inflation makes markets "significantly cheaper" as they decline, and generally, demand-push economies (common during inflation) can lead to higher GDP growth, which acts as a "put" on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Less Investment Demand**: As the "value of money goes up," there's less available for investment across assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.
*   **Reverse Tina Effect**: Rising yields in bonds (e.g., from 0% to 5%) divert money from equities, as investors seek attractive, less risky returns elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Discounting Cash Flows**: Higher interest rates increase the discount rate for future cash flows, making growth stocks and longer-term earnings less valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
*   **Increased Risk Premium**: Higher interest rates and less liquidity mean increased risk premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. This reduces willingness to commit capital on a risk-adjusted basis, as the "Fed put is gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

These second-order effects are ultimately more powerful in reducing equity demand historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. Jim suggests that for the next 10 years, equities might not perform significantly from current levels, although there will be considerable movement in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

## Impact of Interest Rates on Volatility
The [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | volatility]] landscape is also profoundly affected by interest rates and inflation.

### Equity Volatility (Skew)
In January 2022, equity skew (the difference in implied volatility between downside and upside options) was at its 98th-100th percentile, indicating high demand for downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. This was a consequence of entities having incredible payouts from hedges during the massive Vol event in February-March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>.

As the market declined, many long-stock, long-put entities began to monetize their hedges, selling puts. This selling pressure, coupled with underperformance of volatility funds, caused an "avalanche of just selling puts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>. This vol-selling activity "pins realized vol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>, meaning market movements are less volatile than implied by the risk. This has pushed skew to the "zero percentile"â€”historically the lowest Jim has ever experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

This low skew, coupled with high valuations and geopolitical risks, creates a dangerous environment where potential energy for a "real Vol event" is building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. The "Dutch boy with his finger in the dike" (representing S&P implied vol keeping overall market volatility contained) is weakening, and cracks are showing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>.

### Bond Volatility
Historically, bond volatility was "dramatically compressed" because the Fed had essentially cornered the bond market with massive liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>. As the "Fed put" comes off the table due to the dual mandate (inflation and employment), bond volatility structurally goes higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. This releases volatility broadly as the Fed can no longer control bond prices as easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:49">[01:05:49]</a>.

### Commodity Volatility (Oil)
Oil volatility has traditionally been less "pinned" because there hasn't been a single dominant force controlling it like the Fed in bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:09">[01:06:09]</a>. However, in a period of resource scarcity and competition, entities like OPEC are flexing their muscles more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>. The U.S. announcing it will refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at $72 a barrel acts as a "put on oil," indicating structural support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. OPEC is expected to defend prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>. This suggests that despite perceived risk, oil volatility might paradoxically compress because the downside is "cut off," leading to an upside drift with compressed volatility, similar to what's been seen in equities for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>.

## Protecting Spending Power During Inflation
In a secular inflationary environment, traditionally, gold is considered a hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. While gold has not performed as well recently, Jim believes precious metals will do very well in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. He sees a "significant opportunity to upside long dated calls in gold," especially given that volatility in gold hasn't risen as much as in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Other assets like oil and the dollar also act as stores of wealth during inflationary periods, benefiting from first-order effects and a flight to safety due to geopolitical strife and protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

## Liquidity and Risk Premia
In inflationary periods, risk premia tend to go up because there's less liquidity in the market to absorb risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. With fewer players and central banks having less control, the "insurance premium" for assets increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. This presents an opportunity for those willing to warehouse risk, as higher risk premia are good for "insurers" (those selling volatility or providing liquidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

The dynamic between short-term and long-term volatility and liquidity is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. When long-term volatility explodes (as in 2008 for 10-year bond vol), it indicates a significant lack of liquidity and widespread distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. The ability to manage long-term volatility and calendars (spreads between different maturities of options) can help prevent extreme "tailspin" events in volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

In summary, [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | interest rate and bond market movements]] are not merely cyclical but are part of a broader secular shift towards an inflationary regime, which will fundamentally alter how different asset classes, especially equities and commodities, behave and how volatility manifests across markets.

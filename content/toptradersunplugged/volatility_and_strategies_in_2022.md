The year 2022 was widely described as "unprecedented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> and marked what many perceive as "the end of an era" where central banks maintained full control over markets for the prior two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This environment presented unique challenges and opportunities for various [[investment_strategies for volatility | investment strategies]], particularly those sensitive to [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] and trending markets.

## The "Carry Regime" and Volatility

The concept of a "carry regime," defined as a stable environment where central banks were fully in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, was a key point of discussion.

Mark Rasmsinski suggested that 2022 represented a "regime transition" characterized by higher [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. He noted that carry trades typically require exiting during periods of high [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] spikes, which can last for months or quarters before opportunities arise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He emphasizes that for carry trades to work, there needs to be a "dispersion in returns" and differences in central bank behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Jim also discussed the "biggest carry trade in the market" as the upside versus downside, or "right skew" in [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This is driven by the global market being long assets, leading to hedging of the downside tail, which creates a supply and demand imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He believes this regime is "slowing" for the next decade due to less leverage and deleveraging in the system, which should, ironically, "reduce the fat tail" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A "flattening SKU" was observed as a defining characteristic of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The shift signifies that "the cost of money is going up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Rob Cava Jameson noted that carry strategies have underperformed since COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, a pattern seen in other high-[[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] periods like 2008-2009 and 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Despite this, he found that while carry "does really badly when [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] is high," momentum strategies "do even worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, suggesting carry can still perform relatively well during "crazy" market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

The consensus points towards a "regime shift underway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, moving away from declining interest rates, falling inflation, and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This new environment has been characterized as "the great [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]]" by Isabel Schnabel, contrasting with the "great moderation" that preceded it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While the broad market may be in a new era, [[volatility_and_market_positioning | carry opportunities]] still exist, such as in dollar-yen or backwardated commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The shift implies an end to "easy money" and the need for traders to "work for your money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> instead of relying on cheap leverage to hold long natural assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Trend Following in a High Volatility Environment

2022 proved to be an "exceptionally strong year for Trend following" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This performance was attributed to:
*   **Strong Trends:** Persistent price action across multiple markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Broad Market Participation:** Trends were observed across bonds, interest rates, commodities, and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Favorable Setups:** Particularly in interest rates and bonds, low [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] at the start of the year combined with subsequent [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility expansion]] allowed for meaningful position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Mark used the term "the grind" to describe 2022, where markets moved consistently lower or higher over a longer period, allowing models to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. This contrasted with the sharp, short shock of March 2020, which many trend followers failed to capitalize on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The "grind of central banks," "grind of inflation," and "grind of lower end growth" created persistent macro trends that drove price trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

Jim reinforced this, calling the "grind" a "secular force" or "secular trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. He likened the current period to a "turn" where the acceleration to a new trend is very fast, slowing over years as the regime shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. This "secular push" is "very good for Trend in the short term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

Niels noted that trends unfolded slower in some sectors like interest rates and currencies, and correlations, such as bond-equity, were different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. He also highlighted that all time frames, from a few weeks to a couple of years, would have worked well for trend strategies in 2022, even more so than in 2008 or 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## [[Volatility_Trading_and_Market_Structure | Volatility Trading and Market Structure]] in 2022

Jim identified two key factors in [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility trading strategies]] in 2022:
1.  **Cyclical Effect:** Crowding into long skew and downside protection after 2020 led to an oversupply of [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] and over-hedging. This has "compressed [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]], compressed skew" on the way down, a cyclical phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.
2.  **Secular Shift:** A move into a period of "less fed dominance" and "higher inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Historically, during inflationary periods (like the 1960s and 1970s), this kills skew, removes upside trend, and creates a more two-sided market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

Jim noted that anyone who "sold puts and sold stock this year essentially... absolutely killed it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. He believes this general trade will do better over longer time frames in the new secular period, as opposed to short-term tail hedging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>.

### Trend Following vs. Tail Hedging Debate

The discussion extended to the ongoing debate between trend following and tail hedging strategies, particularly referencing papers by Universa and AQR.

Universa's paper asserted that CTA claims of superior risk mitigation are exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a> and that their returns have declined over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. They also suggested that CTAs behave similarly to bonds, which they don't believe are good protectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. However, this was countered by observations that the return-to-[[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] ratio for CTA indices is at an all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a> and that combining CTAs with equities can enhance compounded annual growth rates and reduce drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.

AQR's paper argued that while tail hedges work better in short, sharp drawdowns, trend following excels in "more prolonged drawdowns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Considering the "round trip" (sell-off and recovery), and accounting for returns when equities perform well, trend following appears more attractive over the full cycle than systematic put buying or tail hedging funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Jim criticized the Universa paper for starting its data analysis in 1980, as this 40-year period is precisely the "secular decline" in effectiveness of some trends due to compressed risk premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. He argues that the current "acceleration of a new trend" presents a new opportunity for trend strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. He also believes that the spread between implied and realized [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] is likely to increase, creating more opportunities in the [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility trading space]] due to "less liquidity" and "less money to go around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>.

Jim predicts that while the demand for downside protection will remain strong, particularly in a two-sided market, "more put writing strategies will do significantly well" over the next five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. He contrasts this with "just go and buy puts" as Universa does, which he believes will likely underperform in the future environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from 2022

The year 2022 offered crucial lessons for investors:
*   **Humility and Open-mindedness:** Forecasts made a year out are likely to be "extremely poor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. Markets can change much faster than anticipated, as illustrated by rapid shifts in interest rates and commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.
*   **Price Action as a Guide:** Given the difficulty of forecasting, following "price action first" is a sound basis for any strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:26">[00:52:26]</a>.
*   **Understanding Distribution Shapes:** While predicting market direction is hard, understanding the "prediction of distribution" and the "forces acting upon the structure" of the market is easier and can be "incredibly profitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.
*   **Regime Awareness:** Identifying the current market regime is crucial for understanding conditional likelihoods and having an edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:11">[00:59:11]</a>.
*   **Imagining the Unimaginable:** The past two decades of stability may have dulled the financial world's "imagination that markets can move in crazy ways," a mindset that needs to be regained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.

### The Case of Crypto and FTX
The crypto market in 2022, especially with the FTX scandal, further highlighted market dynamics. While crypto was seen by some as a "speculative bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>, particularly as a currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, the underlying blockchain technology is considered secularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. The bubble reflected a generation seeking ways to "catch back up" financially and expressing frustration with the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.

The crypto market's behavior in 2022, trading "like a risk asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>, disproved claims of it being a "tail hedge" or "inflation hedge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:44">[01:06:44]</a>. The events underscored that the "age of carry" with cheap leverage is ending, necessitating a return to "earn[ing] it the old-fashioned way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:52">[01:08:52]</a>. Furthermore, the FTX collapse emphasized the critical importance of "structures, regulation, and trust" in markets for effective risk allocation and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>.

Ultimately, 2022 was a year of profound shifts in [[market_volatility_and_volatility_strategies | market volatility and volatility strategies]], challenging long-held assumptions and prompting a re-evaluation of [[understanding_volatility_dynamics_in_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] in a new, more uncertain, and potentially higher-volatility era.

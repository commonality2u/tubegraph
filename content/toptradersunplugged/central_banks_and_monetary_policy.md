Central banks continue to hike [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]], with recent actions including the Swiss National Bank raising its rate to 1.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, the Bank of England to 4.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, the ECB to 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, and the [[The Federal Reserve and monetary policy | Federal Reserve]] (Fed) to between 4.75% and 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This increase in [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]] and the practice of Quantitative Tightening (QT) inherently remove liquidity from the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The Fed's actions have been at a historic rate, which inevitably leads to something breaking in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Impact of Monetary Policy

The current period, marked by increased [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]], has been anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The Fed's adjustment of the fed funds rate is likened to carefully extracting a piece from a Jenga tower, indicating the delicate balance involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Despite the inherent fragility in the system, the Fed's response has been controlled and quick, having prepared for potential banking runs for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The Fed's objective was to deflate some air from the market, which they achieved, while also managing the "tail risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Their role involves controlling and managing volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Historically, former [[The Federal Reserve and monetary policy | Federal Reserve]] chairs like Paul Volcker are remembered for slaying inflation, and Ben Bernanke for crisis firefighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Current chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of potentially needing to fulfill both roles simultaneously or having to choose between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### The Fed's Dilemma

The [[The Federal Reserve and monetary policy | Fed]] is in an "impossible situation" with a mandate to control inflation primarily using a cyclical tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This tool works against secular (long-term) inflationary trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

*   **Volcker's Approach** Volcker succeeded in combating inflation by being forceful, primarily because the secular trend of inflation was already ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Earlier Fed chairs had attempted similar strong approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Bernanke's Era** Bernanke operated during a period of strong [[The Federal Reserve and monetary policy | Federal Reserve]] dominance over markets, prior to the tipping point of populism and significant fiscal policy intervention by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Powell's Challenge** Neither Volcker's nor Bernanke's solutions are suitable for the current structural problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. If Powell were to "pull a Volcker" and induce a massive recession, political forces would compel the Fed to pivot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Simultaneously, the populace would push for more fiscal policy, leading to a "worst of both worlds" scenario: recession followed by worse inflation, as seen in the 1960s and 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. More [[Interest rates and monetary policy | monetary policy]] at this point is politically unpopular and goes against the Fed's mandate, as inflation remains persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Geopolitical Influence

The global rise of populism, evidenced by widespread strikes, is a function of excessive inequality driven by [[role of central banks and monetary policy | monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This global phenomenon exacerbates global issues, partly due to protectionism, which is a component of populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Globalization typically occurs during times of monetary expansion, while times of populism lead to the opposite, resulting in more protectionism, less cooperation, increased resource scarcity, and potential global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. These structural issues, built over 40 years, are expected to unwind over approximately 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Volatility in Fixed Income Markets

Recent volatility has been concentrated in the yield curve and fixed income markets, with historic moves observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Last year saw significant increases in yields, a rare occurrence for many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Short-term moves (one to three days) are now comparable to those seen in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

*   [[Interest rates and monetary policy | Interest rate]] volatility has exploded, and it is expected to remain elevated, not returning to previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. This is connected to FX volatility, as [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]] affect cross-national flows and the [[The Federal Reserve and monetary policy | Fed]] battles money supply globally to address inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   Similar periods of high [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rate]] volatility occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s, marking the end of the last inflationary cycle from 1968 to 1982, which included three recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   [[Interest rate]] Vol, or [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rate]] derivatives, is a very liquid market with active trading and significant institutional hedging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. While it was a "wasteland" when [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]] were at zero, it is now an area of growing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

## Loss of Confidence in Central Banks

A potential "Black Swan" event could be a loss of confidence in what [[role of central banks and monetary policy | central banks]] are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. For years, there has been an incredible amount of confidence in central banks' ability to control the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. The recent speed of bank collapses indicates how quickly market confidence can erode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>.

There is a broad belief, stemming from the last 40 years, that the [[The Federal Reserve and monetary policy | Fed]] can control the system and economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. However, there is a secular component to inflation that they are unlikely to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>. The Fed is expected to lose control of the long end of the curve, which will be increasingly tied to higher volatility in [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

A "second let down" by the Fed will likely be accompanied by a loss of confidence in their ability to resolve a stagflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. This moment is expected to happen sometime in the next year or so, likely after or into a recession, when positioning is most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. The key indicator will be an increase in volatility in long-dated bonds, coupled with positioning reflecting a narrative that has become counter-intuitive, such as a belief in a deflationary environment during a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Debt Ceiling

A U.S. election in the next 18 months will significantly influence markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. A major recession before the election would likely trigger a massive fiscal wave, as fiscal policy responses are central to the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:45">[00:51:45]</a>. This could also be a moment when discussions about deflation and controlled CPI surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Regardless of the outcome, more fiscal policy is expected, driven by a populist political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.

The U.S. debt ceiling negotiations are another critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. While an agreement is typically reached at the last minute due to political incentives, the period of emergency funding (where the Treasury does not issue new bonds) has been stimulative, implicitly reversing some effects of Quantitative Tightening (QT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. Once an agreement is made, the subsequent issuance of a large volume of bonds to refill the Treasury's coffers will create supply-demand imbalances, potentially pushing yields higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>. This "secret QE behind the curtain" will dissipate, leading to a greater imbalance and potential market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.

The overall outlook for equities suggests a southward trend on a secular basis, despite potential counter-trend rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. The prevailing environment is one where the "tide is going out," and the dominant influence now is government fiscal policy, shifting from the monetary policy dominance of the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

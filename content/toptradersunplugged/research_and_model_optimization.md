Peter Campoli, co-founder and CEO of Systematic Alpha Management, details the firm's approach to research and model optimization, emphasizing robustness and adaptability over static parameters.

## Balancing Innovation and Consistency
Investors desire continuous innovation from managers but dislike frequent changes to strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Systematic Alpha Management balances this by continuously testing and refining their models to ensure robustness without completely altering their core approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

## Model Development and Parameter Estimation
Systematic Alpha Management employs a unique method for estimating model parameters, moving beyond traditional in-sample data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. They utilize walk-forward out-of-sample tests and various scenarios to verify the [[Overfitting and strategy robustness in trading | robustness]] of their parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. This approach directly addresses the common critique of quantitative models, which often suffer from [[overfitting_and_underfitting_in_trading_models | over-optimization]] of parameters that perform well on historical data but fail in live trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. The goal is to ensure chosen parameters are not merely [[overfitting_and_underfitting_in_trading_models | overfit]] results but are grounded in fundamental reasons for their continued effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

### Mean Reversion Testing
A core aspect of their [[Importance of research in trading strategies | research]] is the continuous monitoring of mean-reverting statistical tests for individual countries and spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. They analyze how these tests behave over different timeframes (e.g., 10 years, 3 years, 6 months) to detect any deterioration in mean reversion, which is critical to their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. If signs of change appear, they may de-leverage their allocation to that particular country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. This quarterly rebalancing of risk is crucial for making necessary adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

### Adapting to Changing Relationships
Hedge ratios are recalculated daily to ensure trading aligns with the most recent market relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. Rapid changes in hedge ratios signal a breakdown in market correlation or relationships, prompting potential withdrawal from that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. For example, the firm ceased trading the Nikkei-Japanese Yen-S&P relationship after new economic policies in Japan caused the Nikkei's correlation with the rest of the world to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>. This dynamic approach allows them to cut risk proactively before significant losses occur, moving away from unstable or ineffective hedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Data-Driven Decisions
Systematic Alpha Management primarily relies on data analysis first, then seeks to explain observed changes through fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. If fundamental analysis conflicts with data, the data is prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. This emphasizes their belief that quantitative data provides the most reliable insights into market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. Peter Campoli himself, while not possessing quantitative skills, contributes to the [[Role of research in investment decisionmaking | research]] process by providing "common sense" direction, challenging existing approaches, and identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. This collaborative approach ensures models are both quantitatively sound and logically coherent.

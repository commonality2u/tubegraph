The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked significant discussions about its potential impact on employment and the broader economy. While technological advancement has historically been deflationary, the current phase of AI development presents unique challenges and opportunities for financial markets and society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

## AI and Employment
Unlike previous technological revolutions that primarily affected blue-collar workers, AI has the potential to impact well-educated, middle-class individuals, potentially rendering their skills obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. This shift could lead to an unusual pickup in unemployment from unexpected sectors of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

The concern is that if AI causes widespread unemployment among the middle class, it could lead to significant social unrest, given that this demographic is not typically as severely affected during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. This societal impact is linked to broader shifts in geopolitical regimes and cycles of civil unrest and war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

It is suggested that [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | technological advancement]], particularly AI, could exacerbate wealth distribution issues, taking money from the rich (through job displacement) and increasing unemployment in the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. This situation would require [[impact_of_government_policy_on_markets | governmental means]] to address, potentially leading to a vacillation between trusting capital markets and demanding more regulatory fairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

## AI and Investment
The current exuberance around AI is seen as a consequence of decades of zero interest rates, which led to significant investment in technology and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. However, as capital is now being pulled away, it could hinder future technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

The discussion likens the current AI excitement to the internet boom of 1999, acknowledging that while [[technological_advancements_effect_on_the_economy | technological advancement]] is unequivocally deflationary and continuous, it does not negate the realities of financial market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.

### Broader Economic Context
AI's impact on employment is seen within a larger context of structural, secular inflationary headwinds and the potential for stagflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The prevailing environment is no longer solely a cyclical economic discussion, but rather a more complex interplay of long-term trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Historically, low interest rates and globalization have contributed to dramatically improved corporate margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. If these trends unwind, for instance, through reshoring production, slowing [[technological_advancements_effect_on_the_economy | technological advancement]], and increased cost of capital, margins could collapse, impacting stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

### Investment Strategies
The rise of passive investment vehicles is also discussed in the context of technological advancements. While some view passive investing as a technological advancement providing lower costs, it's noted that indexing has existed for over a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. It only became viable in periods where simply owning stocks for the long run yielded positive real earnings, unlike periods such as 1968-1982, when active management and derivatives thrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.

Looking forward, it's suggested that a period similar to 1968-1982 could lead to a significant decline in passive investing, as it may no longer be a viable strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a>. This could spur a significant increase in active management, where expertise and the ability to generate non-correlated returns become paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.

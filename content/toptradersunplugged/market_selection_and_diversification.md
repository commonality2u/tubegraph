The world of systematic investing often involves raw exploration of rules-based approaches and the challenges faced by traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This article delves into market selection and the nuances of [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | diversification]] within systematic trading systems, featuring insights from trading legend Perry Kaufman and host Moritz.

## Philosophy of System Development

Success in trading is attributed to perceiving the broader outline of price movements rather than highly specific patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This is why long-term moving averages are effective, as they are resilient to short-term price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Fine-tuning a system is generally not a good approach, leading to the idea that "loose pants fits everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Given the unpredictable nature of market price moves, systems need built-in flexibility to endure various challenging scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

The market is highly unpredictable in the short term, reinforcing the "loose pants fits everyone" philosophy, meaning systems shouldn't be overly specific or constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Ideal systems hold positions through diverse market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Risk Management and Volatility Targeting
A critical aspect is determining the amount of risk one is willing to accept and managing that risk differently than through fine-tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Measuring risk should be based on daily returns or Net Asset Values (NAVs) of the system, rather than the underlying volatility of individual markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

[[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | Volatility stabilization]], or volatility targeting, involves aiming for a specific portfolio volatility, typically around 12% for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. If volatility exceeds the target, positions are cut; if it falls below, leverage is increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Adjustments are not daily, but rather when volatility moves significantly, for example, by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The most significant improvement from this strategy often comes from raising portfolio volatility to the target level during periods of low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

Moritz adds that while returns cannot be controlled, risk can be adjusted by sizing positions in relation to acceptable risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. There isn't a single universal definition of risk, as traders view it differently, some equating it with volatility, others using value-at-risk, or average true range for position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

A common mistake is trying to fine-tune a system to reduce risk, as risk will inevitably surface elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The goal is to understand the true risk and manage the portfolio to avoid being wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Market Selection Strategy

Position sizing is the fundamental step in risk control, ensuring equal risk across all trades in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. If trades have unequal risk, the higher-risk trade must justify it with higher predicted returns, which is generally not predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

Perry Kaufman's approach involves ranking the performance of stocks and futures markets based on how they perform under his system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. He believes in the persistence of performance: if a market performs best, it tends to continue doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This means focusing on the "most trending" markets like bonds and avoiding markets that are only marginally profitable for the system, as they can deteriorate overall risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

Markets with a lot of noise are generally not well-suited for trend following systems, as they lead to frequent stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

When selecting markets, the focus is on the performance of the market *under the rules of the trading system*, not just its raw Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. Perry argues that placing too many restrictions on performance, such as combining return and risk in a Sharpe ratio for selection, can lead to worse future results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. Instead, he picks markets that perform best in *returns only*, managing the overall portfolio leverage for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

An exception to this is when a market's individual volatility becomes excessively high (e.g., annualized volatility over 100%), signaling unsustainable conditions and prompting an exit despite profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

Markets are ranked by returns over a relatively short period, such as 60 days, to remain sensitive to changing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. The top-performing markets are selected, and if one falls out of the top ranks (e.g., by four positions), it is replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This process can reduce the effective holding period of a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

### [[Diversification and portfolio management | Diversification]] Debate
Perry Kaufman limits his exposure to 20-22 markets in a futures portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>. If only one sector (e.g., interest rates or FX) qualifies as profitable, he reduces the total exposure in that sector by about 50% to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. If two or three sectors provide [[philosophies_on_sector_allocation_and_market_diversity | diversification]], he leverages up to full exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. He notes that stocks, even when [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlated]], have their own personality, unlike some futures markets like interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

Moritz expresses a strong belief in [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | diversification]], arguing that while the mathematical benefit of [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | diversification]] declines after 18-20 markets, it's never zero as long as markets are not perfectly [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>. He views this as a "free snack" that doesn't cost anything to exploit, and he wants to "roll as many dice as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. Perry, however, maintains that adding marginal markets with lower returns, even for [[diversification_and_portfolio_management | diversification]], can deteriorate overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>.

### Market Characteristics and Noise
Using an "efficiency ratio" can help select markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. This ratio measures the net price change over a period divided by the sum of individual daily movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. A ratio of one indicates perfect trending, while a ratio near zero signifies a noisy market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>. For trend following, higher ratios are preferred (typically interest rates and FX markets), while for mean reversion, noisier markets (like equity indices) are better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This selection process is a one-time step and is not used again after the portfolio is defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a>.

Perry notes that mature, more liquid markets tend to become noisier and less ideal for trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Initially, emerging markets with low participation and concentrated opinions exhibit clearer trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. As markets mature and attract more retail investors or institutional funds with random or scheduled contributions, they introduce noise, making price movements less logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

However, bonds/interest rates have consistently been the best-performing sector for trend followers for decades, despite their liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. This is largely due to central bank policy, which incrementally adjusts interest rates, creating long-term trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. While there is more noise in the market generally, trends still exist, though it may take longer for a trend following system to identify changes, leading to smaller extractable pieces of the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>.

## Equity Indices vs. Individual Stocks
Moritz questions whether trading equity indices (baskets of stocks) limits [[diversification_and_portfolio_management | diversification]] potential compared to trading individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. Perry agrees, preferring individual stocks for their unique personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.

Perry typically does not trade the short side of equity markets in long-term trend systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. Stock market declines are often violent and short-lived, making it difficult for long-term systems to profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>. Most futures markets, with exceptions like grains, have generally increased in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. Inflation means being long is generally safer than being short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

The upward bias in stocks is partly due to survivorship bias in equity indices, which remove underperforming stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:28">[01:06:28]</a>. However, trading the short side of individual stocks is also more difficult and costly due to borrowing requirements and liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.

## Evolution of Trend Following
While some aspects like using multiple parameters for realistic expected returns have been integrated for a while, Perry's most recent addition to his trend systems (in the last year) is an "extreme risk exit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This mechanism triggers a complete exit from the market if portfolio volatility exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., 32% annualized for a 10-stock portfolio) and the market is net down for three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:13">[01:31:13]</a>. This is designed to protect against scenarios where even uncorrelated markets experience high [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlations]] and simultaneous downturns during a crisis, as investors liquidate assets for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. Perry has had three successful instances of using this exit strategy in a single year, greatly reducing exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:09">[01:24:09]</a>.

Ultimately, traders must be comfortable with their chosen risk management and position sizing approach to stick with a system for the long term, especially in trend following, which is a long-term dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

The application of fractal geometry has significantly influenced the development of [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic trading]] methods and [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | market analysis]]. This approach provides a theoretical and objective basis for understanding market behavior, particularly regarding the persistence of trends.

## Early Influences and Background
Initially, early [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systems traders]] found technical trading to be straightforward due to the limited number of participants [00:00:08]. Most commodity traders were small investors or traded intuitively, making the discipline of a system a significant advantage [00:00:21]. Almost any system, including simple moving average crossovers, could work effectively [00:36:49]. However, this environment has changed, with the industry now dominated by [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systems traders]] [00:00:38].

Bill Dries, with a background in electrical engineering and operations research, was drawn to Bayesian decision theory and computer modeling [05:32:00]. His early work involved state-of-the-art computer modeling for tactical warfare [05:51:53]. An Air Force officer introduced him to commodities [07:01:46], leading him to discover Richard Donchian and the literature of the day, such as Edwards and Magee [07:06:19]. This inspired his development of [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic trading]] methods in the late 1970s [07:21:00].

Initially, his focus was on traditional [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysis]] patterns like heads and shoulders, triangles, and trend lines [08:30:57]. He concluded early on that only trend lines, along with support and resistance, had any real usefulness, viewing other patterns as akin to "reading tea leaves" [08:44:59]. His goal became to systematize these useful aspects of [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysis]] [09:17:20].

## The Influence of Benoit Mandelbrot
A pivotal shift occurred with the work of Benoit Mandelbrot on fractal geometry [16:16:19]. Mandelbrot's book, *The Fractal Geometry of Nature*, revealed its applicability to modeling markets [16:26:28]. Notably, Mandelbrot's first published paper was on the cotton market, included in Paul Cootner's compilation *The Random Character of Stock Market Prices* [16:37:37].

Mandelbrot's work challenged the efficient market hypothesis, which posited that markets were random walks [20:49:17]. He argued that markets are not random in the conventionally discussed sense, but exhibit "persistence" [22:36:00]. This means that trends on various timescales tend to persist longer than expected in a pure random walk [22:45:47]. This provided a theoretical and scientific basis for the possibility of profiting in markets through [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] methods [23:03:00].

## The Fractal Wave Algorithm
Inspired by Mandelbrot's work and the Elliott Wave concept (which views patterns within patterns) [17:09:47], the Fractal Wave Algorithm was developed [18:02:49]. While Elliott Wave theory imposes restrictive conditions (fives and threes) on market patterns, which the market doesn't always cooperate with [17:40:00], the Fractal Wave Algorithm adopts a "bottom-up" approach [33:19:00].

The fundamental pattern in this algorithm is the "zigzag" (price goes up, down, then up again, or vice versa) [18:35:00]. These basic zigzags combine to form larger-scale zigzags, creating a self-similar fractal structure across different scales [18:46:00]. The algorithm mechanically specifies turning points in price action at various fractal levels [19:09:00], similar to Dow Theory which describes short, medium, and long-term waves [19:18:00].

### Objective vs. Subjective Analysis
Unlike traditional [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysis]], where technicians might draw trend lines differently, the Fractal Wave Algorithm objectively identifies turning points [35:01:00]. These objectively identified points are then used to draw trend lines [34:41:00]. The system combines traditional [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysis]] ideas with mechanical implementation, eliminating subjective judgments [35:20:00].

The system's objective nature provides discipline and eliminates the possibility of "second-guessing," which is often a downfall for [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysts]] [35:54:00].

## Application in Trading Strategy
The Fractal Wave system is used as the basis for trading, leading to a decision to re-enter the business in 1991 [19:57:00]. The strategy primarily focuses on [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] [23:12:44]. The system itself is purely mechanical, running daily with orders calculated once a week based on weekly charts [25:32:00]. This long-term [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] approach means trading less frequently, which lowers transaction costs by reducing slippage [26:41:00].

While longer-term trading may expose the system to greater drawdowns due to wider stop-loss placements [27:46:00], [[diversification_in_trend_following | diversifying]] the portfolio tends to mitigate this risk [28:07:00]. Furthermore, long-term traders can ride through fluctuations where shorter-term traders might exit and re-enter, potentially achieving better outcomes [28:22:00].

## Parameters and Market Nature
A key aspect of this fractal approach is its reduced reliance on optimizing numerical parameters for data fitting [39:42:00]. Instead, it deals with fundamental patterns rather than numbers [39:56:00]. While choices like trading weekly versus daily charts are still parameters, they are selected based on qualitative criteria about how markets work, not through optimization [40:38:00]. The parameters that exist, such as the typical duration of zigzags across different scales (e.g., three times the shorter zigzag's duration), naturally emerge from the application of the algorithm itself [42:56:00].

The success of any [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | trading system]], including those based on fractal geometry, ultimately depends on the opportunities provided by the market [24:41:00]. The underlying reason for market profitability, whether for [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] systems or fundamental traders, is the market's exhibition of persistence [24:05:00]. This implies that successful trading is more dependent on the market's inherent nature than on the specific methodology employed [24:50:00]. Periods where [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] seems "dead" are simply phases influenced by the [[the_impact_of_market_conditions_on_trading_strategies | nature of the markets]] [25:11:00], not a fundamental failure of the approach. Fundamental drivers like supply and demand in commodity markets and economic forces in financial markets underpin these persistent trends [26:01:00].

## Operational Structure
The trading operations are largely automated, with the system running on a remote server for security and backups [55:15:00]. The system itself has remained virtually unchanged for 25 years [25:51:00], requiring minimal daily maintenance [55:40:00]. This automation and lean structure allow for operational flexibility and location independence, aligning with personal goals like living near the beach to surf [10:38:00].

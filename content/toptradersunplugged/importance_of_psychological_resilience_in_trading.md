The importance of psychological resilience in trading is highlighted throughout the conversation, emphasizing the need for traders to manage their emotional responses, learn from mistakes, and maintain a long-term perspective amidst constant market volatility and personal stress.

### The Inevitability of Mistakes and the Need to Move On
Even highly successful traders will not have every trade work out, and mistakes are an inherent part of the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. It is critical for a trader's [[managing_emotional_responses_in_trading | psychological ability]] to move on from a trade that did not work out and proceed to the next one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. While natural to feel frustrated, getting caught up in self-recrimination ("oh I should have, why didn't I do this") is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

### Trading as a Continuous Game
Unlike a poker session where one can simply "pick up chips and go" after a bad run, investments never truly stop; a portfolio is always running, even while sleeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This continuous nature means traders don't have the "luxury" of a clean slate every day, unlike day traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. Therefore, the "victory is really getting to play again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>, emphasizing the long-term persistence required.

### Personal Identity and Performance
For money managers, personal identity is often tied up in their performance, making underperformance a significant blow to their ego and sense of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. This intense personal connection to results contributes to the high stress experienced by professional traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

### Managing Stress and Maintaining Perspective
Having weekends or time to reset and rethink positions is crucial for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. In crisis situations like March 2020, where external outlets like hiking trails and beaches were closed, finding ways to decompress became even more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

The core work of a trader is "to think," not merely to spend time in front of screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. The most rewarding moment is not necessarily making money, but conceiving of a trade with conviction, a moment of figuring something out where one cannot wait to put the trade on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

### Navigating Unpredictable Crises
Over a career, something unpredictable happens every few years, such as the Asian financial crisis, Russian debt crisis, LTCM crisis, 9/11, Global Financial Crisis, European debt crisis, Chinese devaluation, Brexit, the COVID-19 pandemic, and most recently, the war in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:15">[00:57:15]</a>. These events are often unforeseen and drastically impact global financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>. It is crucial to remember this when positioning for the long term, as something unexpected will always occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>.

During such periods, traders must manage psychological pressures and continue to manage their portfolios, even if they have strong personal feelings about the events unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

### Portfolio vs. Position Risk Management
While it is tempting to focus on cutting risk in individual positions, it is more important to maintain a balanced portfolio and understand its overall state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. Cutting a trade that is currently making money might seem logical to take profits when the portfolio is doing poorly, but it could remove the "lifeline" that is keeping the overall portfolio afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. This strategic focus on overall portfolio balance is a key aspect of [[risk_management_in_trading | effective risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

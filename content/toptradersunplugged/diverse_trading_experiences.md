The "Top Traders Unplugged" roundtable brought together pioneers in managed futures and [[Systematic trading strategies | systemic trading]], including Richard Dennis, Brian Plata, and Jerry Parker, who shared insights into their diverse trading backgrounds and the genesis of the famous Turtle Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Richard Dennis: From Floor to Off-Floor Trading

Richard Dennis, creator of the Turtle Program, had significant trading experience before its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. He spent 14 years as a floor trader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Approximately four to five years prior to the Turtle program, he transitioned to trading from an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. This shift was driven by the clear need to trade more markets than the one or two accessible within a trading pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

Dennis's introduction to [[Evolution of Trading Systems and Strategies | trend-following]] began early; he started trading around age 17, drawing on books by long-gone authors on the subject and conducting research by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. He came to know other pioneers like Richard Donchian, Bill Dunn, or Keith Campbell well after he had already begun trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Jerry Parker: From Accounting to Futures Enthusiasm

Jerry Parker, a "turtle" and president of Chesapeake Capital, was working for an accounting firm in Richmond, Virginia, and pursuing his CPA certificate before joining the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. His interest in trading started as a hobby, reading books about the stock market, watching "Wall Street Week," and subscribing to newsletters like Marty Zweig's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

Marty Zweig's approach, which was a form of [[Systematic trading strategies | trend-following]], served as Parker's initial exposure to this style of trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. He found futures appealing due to their leverage, and the ability to trade currencies, commodities, and interest rates offered greater [[Diversification in Futures Markets | diversification]] and the option to go short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. He envisioned how large profits could offset small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. Parker saw an article about Richard Dennis in Business Week and then the famous ad in The Wall Street Journal in late August or September 1983, which prompted him to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

## Brian Plata: From Aspiring Banker to Back Office

Brian Plata, a "turtle" and managing director of EMC Capital Advisors, graduated from Miami of Ohio in 1982 with aspirations of entering Investment Banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. However, a significant recession in 1982 led to a lack of banking job openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

He eventually met Maverick Lip, who ran an FCM (Futures Commission Merchant) and introduced him to C&D Commodities, a newly formed firm by Larry Carroll and Richard Dennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. Brian began working for Dennis as a runner, phone clerk, and back-office trade checker, handling various tasks related to the trading operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. This role allowed him to observe the first group of turtles and their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. When Dennis and Bill Eckhardt considered a second round of the program, Dennis advised Plata that joining the program to trade off-floor would be a better career path than pursuing pit trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. His existing knowledge from working with C&D Commodities meant his entry process was less formal than that of other applicants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.

## The Shift to Off-Floor Trading and Diversification

The common thread among Dennis, Plata, and the partners at C&D Commodities was the shift to trading "off the floor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. This approach allowed for [[Diversification and risk management in trading systems | diversification]] across a wider range of markets and capitalized on opportunities where markets were moving and trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. For instance, if grain markets were dull, more volatile markets in New York might offer better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

## Diverse Selection for the Turtle Program

Richard Dennis sought a variety of applicants for the Turtle Program, aiming for diverse backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. While there was no single "killer aspect" for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>, preferred candidates typically had no prior experience as floor traders, as existing habits were often considered a detriment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. A key skill sought was statistical aptitude, which led to the selection of many professional blackjack players, who understood odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. Questions were also asked to gauge general intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.

Despite these criteria, Dennis noted that the selection process wasn't perfect, and initial expectations about how well individuals would perform often proved incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:21:00]</a>. He believes the success of the Turtle program, and trading in general, relies heavily on being "rule-oriented" and persistent, rather than on innate talent or intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>.

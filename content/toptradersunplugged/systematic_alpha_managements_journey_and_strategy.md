Systematic Alpha Management is a firm co-founded by Peter Campbell and Alexei Chekhov, known for its unique, [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investment strategies]] that diverge significantly from traditional trend-based approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

## Origins and Evolution

Peter Campbell's journey in finance began in 1995, after graduating with a finance degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:40">[11:40:40]</a>. His first job was at a broker-dealer, and by 1998, at the age of 21, he established his own introducing broker-dealer in New York City, initially trading equities for individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

The internet bubble burst in 2000, leading to a major collapse in Nasdaq, prompting Peter to seek strategies that would perform well regardless of equity market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. This led to his meeting with Alexei Chekhov in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Alexei, holding a PhD from Princeton University, had prior experience working for a long-term [[systematic_trend_following_strategies_and_performance | trend following]] CTA called Trend Logic Associates, and also at a French bank where he did fixed income spread trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. Their combined experience and vision led to the development of their [[systematic_investing | systematic investing]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

The firm started managing individual managed accounts in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. In 2004, these accounts were consolidated, and Systematic Alpha Management officially launched its fund, celebrating its 10th anniversary at the end of 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

## Investment Programs

Systematic Alpha Management currently operates two main programs:

### 1. Systematic Alpha Futures Program (Original Program)

*   **Launch**: Began managing individual managed accounts in 2001, consolidated into a fund in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: This is a market-neutral program designed to perform well in any market environment, regardless of the direction of equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>. It applies concepts from long/short equity trading, statistical arbitrage, and spread trading in fixed income markets to major global equity indices and currency futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Core Concept**: The strategy exploits temporary divergences and mispricings between highly correlated global equity markets due to differences in time zones and intraday liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a>. For example, when European markets open, S&P futures may lag, and vice-versa when US markets close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:37:00">[50:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:06:00">[56:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Trade Mechanics**: Trades involve going long and short highly related markets simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:42]</a>. An example is trading the FTSE 100 against the S&P 500, with a British Pound currency leg to hedge exposure, creating a triangular relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.
    *   **Other Spreads**: The firm also trades other types of spreads, such as Russell 2000 against Nasdaq 100 (exploiting small-cap vs. large-cap stock short-term divergences) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. Some strategies also include a commodity hedge for indices highly correlated to commodities, like Canadian or Australian stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>.
    *   **Holding Period**: The average holding period for a trade is about one day, or eight to ten trading hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:00">[57:57:00]</a>. The predictive power of their models is high within this timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:07:00">[59:07:00]</a>. Trades are exited with a hard stop if markets diverge fundamentally, or on a small reversal if held for longer than a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:50:00">[59:50:00]</a>. Approximately two-thirds of trades are profitable, with a hit ratio of about 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:21:00">[59:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:25:00">[59:25:00]</a>.
*   **Markets Traded**: The firm trades approximately 20 to 25 different markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.
*   **Performance**: The program generated very strong returns in 2012, primarily due to adjustments made after the 2011 drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. It prefers environments with elevated volatility, particularly when volatility is high but uniform across related markets, rather than divergent volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. The correlation of their program to equities and other CTAs is close to zero, offering unique diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:05:00">[18:05:00]</a>.

### 2. Systematic Alpha Multi-Strategy Program

*   **Launch**: Introduced in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Developed to increase diversification following the challenging experiences of 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.
*   **Allocation**: Has a 50/50 allocation split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>:
    *   50% to the original spread trading program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
    *   50% to directional models, which are similar to short-term [[systematic_trend_following_strategies_and_performance | trend following]] or momentum models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification Benefit**: The directional models tend to perform best when the spread component is suffering, and vice-versa, creating a negatively correlated return stream in times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. The goal is to reduce the likelihood of large drawdowns, though it might result in a higher correlation to other CTAs and less stable returns compared to the pure spread program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Adaptations

In 2011, Systematic Alpha Management faced its only negative year on record, experiencing six consecutive negative months from March through August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This period was particularly challenging due to the European debt crisis, which caused European equity indices to decline much faster and with greater volatility than US markets, leading to significant divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

Due to investor redemptions, the firm lost 90% of its assets, falling from a peak of over $700 million in February 2011 to as low as $50 million by March or April 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Following this drawdown, the firm implemented important modifications to its [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investing strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. These adjustments, focusing on details like specific markets to trade, precise entry/exit timing, and hedge ratios, were crucial for their strong returns in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Despite the core concept remaining the same, constant adjustments are necessary to adapt to ever-changing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Organizational Structure and Technology

Systematic Alpha Management maintains all its main functions in-house, including:
*   **Research**: Development and programming of trading models. This involves proprietary software and backtesting tools that analyze one-minute resolution data going back many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:31:00">[37:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.
*   **Trading**: Fully automated execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:40:00">[37:40:00]</a>. Traders monitor the machines to ensure systems run correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.
*   **Back Office**: In-house functions to service managed accounts, with many processes also automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:44:00">[37:44:00]</a>.
*   **Compliance**: Handled internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing**: Primarily done in-house, though they also work with third-party marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.

The firm operates with a team of twelve people, most of whom have been with the company for over five years, some for ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>. Although they had a larger team when assets were higher, increased automation has allowed them to operate more efficiently with a smaller headcount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:53:00">[39:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:22:00">[40:22:00]</a>.

## Market Environment and Strategy Robustness

The firm's [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investment strategies]] are unique because they exploit liquidity-driven mispricings in global equity indices and currency futures, which arise from differences in time zones and intraday liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>. This arbitrage source is considered persistent as time zone differences will always exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:28:00">[52:28:00]</a>.

While many short-term managers face model decay, Systematic Alpha Management's core strategy has remained robust for nearly 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:32:00">[53:32:00]</a>. The firm continuously re-optimizes parameters, such as hedge ratios and trade timing, and adjusts which markets to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:46:00">[48:46:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:43:00">[53:43:00]</a>. Statistical tests for mean reversion in spreads are constantly conducted to monitor the environment and ensure model efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>.

The strategy benefits when volatility is high, as divergences tend to be larger and more frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>. They are not outright long volatility but benefit from it being elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:15:00">[28:15:00]</a>. The current environment of exceptionally low implied volatility (e.g., S&P 500 annualized realized volatility at 6-7% compared to a long-term average of 18%) makes it difficult for [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] to produce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:09:00">[31:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>. Historically, periods of such low volatility have often preceded market crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:00">[32:12:00]</a>.

## Awards and Recognition

Systematic Alpha Management has received multiple accolades for its performance, including:
*   2014 Pinnacle Award for Best Diversified CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   US Performance Award for 2014 from CTA Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   Similar awards from HFM Week in 2009 and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

Despite the awards and their unique, uncorrelated strategy, the firm acknowledges that raising capital in the current environment is difficult, especially for smaller firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. They believe their strategy adds significant value at the portfolio level by reducing overall risk, as it often has negative returns when other managers struggle, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

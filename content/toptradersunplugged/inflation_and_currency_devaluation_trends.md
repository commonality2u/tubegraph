## Current Global Macro Picture

The current global economic situation is characterized by the high point of two very long-term cycles: the long-term debt cycle in the US and the global monetary framework, which is largely [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | dollar-centric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Historically, every 50 to 100 years, economies reach a point where a much larger deleveraging event and phase shift occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. The last time this occurred was in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Historical Parallels: 1930s and 1940s

### The 1930s: Deflationary Shock and Devaluation
The 1920s saw a significant credit cycle build-up, culminating in a market crash and the start of the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Private debt as a percentage of GDP reached all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. The 1930s experienced a massive deleveraging event, with many bank failures and the broad money supply decreasing by about a third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. This led to a significant [[inflation_vs_deflation | deflationary]] shock, with official deflation levels reaching 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

The exit strategy involved significant currency devaluation: the dollar was de-pegged from 1/20th of an ounce of gold to 1/35th of an ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. This was coupled with massive money printing, infrastructure programs, and increased federal debt, leading to an expansion of the monetary base and an increase in federal debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. The private debt was reduced primarily in real terms through dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. The 1930s were characterized by a large [[inflation_vs_deflation | deflationary]] shock followed by some reflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

### The 1940s: Inflationary Environment
By the 1940s, the private debt bubble had mostly resolved, but the US entered World War II, leading to massive federal deficits, sometimes reaching 20-30% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. This fiscal spending caused a strong rise in federal debt to over 100% of GDP, resulting in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. The Federal Reserve partnered with the Treasury to fund these deficits through what was essentially quantitative easing (QE), buying treasuries and printing dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. They implemented formal yield curve control, keeping treasury yields locked under 2.5% throughout the decade, even as [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] sometimes reached double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

Investors in treasuries made nominal gains but lost purchasing power in real terms due to [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. This strategy of inflating away debt allowed the government to reduce federal debt as a percentage of GDP without decreasing the nominal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Current Situation: 2010s and 2020s

### The 2010s: Disinflationary Environment
The 2008 Great Financial Crisis was similar to the 1929 period, with a massive multi-decade buildup of private sector debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Total debt levels exceeded those of 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. A significant deleveraging event occurred, with debt moving to the federal level; federal debt to GDP rose from about 65% to over 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

For several years, the environment was disinflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. While there was an [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflationary]] policy response in the form of QE, much of it went to recapitalize banks and was offset by deleveraging in the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. Banks entered the crisis with about 3% cash as a percentage of assets, which increased to 8% after the first round of QE and 15% by the end of QE3 around 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.

### The 2020s: Towards Higher Inflation
Entering the COVID-19 crisis, corporate debt had built up again, and federal debt was at 106% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>. Deficits are now as large as they were during World War II, running at 20-30% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. These large deficits are expected to continue for several years due to joblessness impacting the tax base and ongoing stimulus needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This situation mimics the 1940s, with a shift from private debt to sovereign debt bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

## Drivers of Inflation and Currency Devaluation

### Debt and Fiscal Spending
Unlike the 1930s and 1940s where private and federal debt bubbles were worked off separately, the current era faces very high federal and private debt simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. Combined public and private debt to GDP is around 350% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. The US has a larger debt problem to address, though it also has a more diversified economy and slower demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

The massive fiscal deficits, including direct checks to citizens and extra unemployment benefits, are directly injecting money into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. This differs from the 2010s QE, which primarily recapitalized banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. This direct injection is a key reason for expected higher [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] in the 2020s compared to the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>.

### Supply Chains
Similar to World War II's supply shortages, the current globalized supply chains have shown vulnerabilities, leading to shortages of critical materials (e.g., masks during the pandemic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>. Concerns about relying on adversaries for components (e.g., US military components from China) are driving a desire to reshore supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. This reshoring, moving production from cheaper places to higher-cost domestic locations, can be inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:52:00">[30:52:00]</a>.

Historically, technology and offshoring have offset [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] in goods like electronics and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:33:00">[31:33:00]</a>. However, reshoring supply chains, combined with a potential period of higher commodity prices (due to weak exploration in the past decade), could lead to [[inflation_and_deflation_forces_in_the_global_economy | inflation]] in these areas, in addition to existing high inflation in services (healthcare, education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:52:00">[31:52:00]</a>.

### Monetary Policy: QE and Yield Curve Control
The Federal Reserve, like other central banks, is engaged in significant QE, buying treasuries to keep yields low. While they avoid calling it "debt monetization," most sovereign bond issuance in many countries is being accumulated by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. The Fed's stated [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] target is 2%, but they have indicated willingness to tolerate symmetric [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] (going above 2% for a period to compensate for past undershoots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. This ideal scenario for central banks involves yields at 1-2% and [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] at 3% or higher (which could translate to 4-6% or more in real terms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. The aim is to "inflate away" debt gradually rather than through a sharp, uncontrollable spike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.

If global investors lose confidence in currencies and bonds, a sharp spike in [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] could quickly get out of control, as central banks may not raise rates to stop it in a yield curve control environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>.

## Impact and Outlook

The base case is for higher [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] in the 2020s compared to the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. A significant [[depreciating_currency_and_economic_recovery | currency devaluation]] is expected by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:00">[25:22:00]</a>. This could manifest as a large devaluation versus commodities and hard assets, while everyday prices might rise by 3-5% annually for a few years, or it could be a more 1970s-like environment with high everyday [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32:00">[25:32:00]</a>.

The host highlights that "official" [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] numbers can be deceptive, pointing to rising healthcare costs and European inflation calculations that exclude shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>.

Historically, debt jubilees have been common, often taking the form of currency devaluation in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:38:00">[51:38:00]</a>. For example, the dollar has devalued significantly against [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold]] from 1/20th of an ounce to nearly 1/1800th today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:54:00">[51:54:00]</a>. In the 1940s and 1970s, those holding treasuries effectively provided the US government with a "soft debt jubilee" as their purchasing power diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:28:00">[52:28:00]</a>. This pattern of [[depreciating_currency_and_economic_recovery | currency devaluations]] is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>.

## Investment Implications

In an [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflationary]] environment, scarce assets generally perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>.

### Precious Metals and Commodities
[[gold_and_currency_dynamics | Gold]] and silver are expected to do very well in the 2020s, despite potential corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:12:00">[34:12:00]</a>. A broad basket of commodities and high-quality commodity producers are also expected to perform strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:58:00">[35:58:00]</a>. This includes [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | copper]] and other metals used in renewable energy and electric vehicles, where exploration has been limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:04:00">[35:04:00]</a>. [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | Gold]] is expected to reach over $3,000 by the end of the decade, potentially doubling or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>.

Historically, [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold]] trades inversely to real [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21:00">[50:21:00]</a>. In environments with low or negative real yields, as expected for much of the 2020s, [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold]] is likely to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:52:00">[50:52:00]</a>. A trend-following approach can help mitigate risks in volatile commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:49:00">[50:49:00]</a>.

### Real Estate
Real estate can be a decent hedge against [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]], especially for investors who can secure a low, long-term fixed-rate mortgage on a reasonably priced home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>. However, expensive urban real estate may not provide the same hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:00">[36:28:00]</a>.

### Bitcoin
Bitcoin is considered a "scarce digital asset" and a smaller-cap speculative store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Its market cap, fluctuating between $100 billion and $200 billion, is significantly smaller than [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold]]'s $8-10 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:11:00">[45:11:00]</a>. It's not hard to imagine Bitcoin eventually reaching a $1 trillion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

A "FedCoin" or central bank cryptocurrency is not seen as a threat to Bitcoin, as it would not be scarce or decentralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:22:00">[43:22:00]</a>. The main tail risk for Bitcoin is government attempts to ban it, which could make it a black market item, though its decentralized and global nature offers resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:54:00">[43:54:00]</a>. Given the defined downside (zero) and undefined upside, a small allocation (e.g., 1%) to Bitcoin is deemed reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:00">[44:51:00]</a>.

### Institutional Challenges
Many pensions and large institutional portfolios are not heavily interested in precious metals, commodities, or Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[54:36:00]</a>. They may not expect treasuries to yield significant negative real returns over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:29:00">[55:29:00]</a>. Many pensions are mandated to hold bonds, a strategy based on past disinflationary trends and falling yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:19:00">[58:19:00]</a>. However, with current low or negative yields and high debt, there's significant risk to institutions with large bond exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:34:00">[58:34:00]</a>. Some are even leveraging up their bond exposures to meet target returns, which is a risky strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>. This could lead to pension failures or government bailouts, further contributing to [[depreciating_currency_and_economic_recovery | currency devaluation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:35:00">[59:35:00]</a>.

From: [[toptradersunplugged]] <br/> 

Historian Neil Howe's theory proposes that modern history moves in [[generational_cycles and the Fourth Turning | generational cycles]], each lasting approximately the length of one long human life. These cycles are driven by the public mood, which in turn is influenced by the human life cycle and characterized by four distinct eras or "turnings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Major historical events act as catalysts, shaping the characteristics and collective personalities of generations as they come of age and react to the prevailing societal mood.

## The Four Turnings

Each turning typically lasts 20 to 23 years, and society's response to the challenges of one turning sets the stage for the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### 1. The First Turning (High)
This era follows the resolution of a "Fourth Turning" crisis, redefining a country constitutionally and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. It is characterized by strong institutions, weak individualism, and a strong ethic of social conformity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. People are modest about themselves and make efforts to fit in, prioritizing the needs of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This period also sees a rising ethic and reality of [[generational_power_shifts_and_inequality | equality]], with income and wealth becoming more equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. The prevailing fear is a return to the preceding crisis, driving a desire for strong institutions and collective problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: The period after World War II, encompassing the presidencies of Truman, Eisenhower, and John Kennedy. This was a time of significant progress, with balanced budgets, infrastructure development (interstate highways), and major technological advancements (Apollo Moon mission, miracle vaccines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:45]</a>.

### 2. The Second Turning (Awakening)
This period emerges as a reaction against the social conformity of the First Turning. People try to shed social discipline, rules, and regulations, questioning "Why are we doing all this stuff?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. It is a time of "Consciousness Revolution," marked by the throwing off of social obligations and a shift from an interest in the "outer world" (large institutions) to the "inner world" (personal and cultural behavior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Deficits become standard as saving for future generations is less prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: The period from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, which started in inner cities and college campuses, challenging police authority and male patriarchy. Later, it included conservative movements for tax cuts and deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Historically, these are known as "Great Awakenings" (e.g., First, Second, and the "Consciousness Revolution" being a later one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

### 3. The Third Turning (Unraveling)
Following the Awakening, this era is characterized by strong individualism and weak institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. It is a decade of weak civic authority, cynicism, and "bad manners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. The underlying assumption is that markets and individualism will continue to expand globally, leading to a fading away of governments and a rise of "deracinated individuals" or "nomads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. This societal fragmentation eventually leads to increasing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:07]</a>.

*   **Example**: The period from the mid-1980s up until the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008, akin to the "Roaring Nineties" or "Roaring Twenties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.

### 4. The Fourth Turning (Crisis)
This is a period of exceptional upheaval and conflict, where society supplies almost no order or security, yet individuals increasingly crave it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. Multiple crises emerge, leading to increasingly severe organized conflict, where new institutions are born and a new "common Republic" emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Polarization intensifies rapidly during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:36:00">[35:36:00]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   **The Global Financial Crisis (2008)**: Neil Howe marks this as the catalyst for the current Fourth Turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>. Financial crashes often serve as catalysts for Fourth Turnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>.
    *   **The Great Depression and World War II**: The last Fourth Turning, catalyzed by Black Thursday (1929) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>.
    *   **The American Civil War**: Triggered by the Panic of 1857 and Lincoln's election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.
    *   **The American Revolution**: Preceded by the London crash of 1772 and catalyzed by events like the Boston Tea Party and Coercive Acts (1773) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>.

## Generational Responses and Global Impact

Historical events not only shape societal mood but also the collective personality of rising generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>.

*   **Millennials**: Coined by Neil Howe, this generation is seen as exceptionally important for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. They crave order, community, and social guarantees, rejecting the risk-taking favored by previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. They are peer-oriented and gravitate towards platforms like social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. This desire for order may lead to a willingness to cut off debate and safeguards in favor of direct action to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>.
*   **Boomers**: Came of age during the Awakening, rebelling against the constraints of their World War II-winning parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. They disliked the middle class, which they saw as "too equal," and sought more individualized lives, leading to a significant decline in average household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. In the current Fourth Turning, Boomers are expected to voluntarily give up fiscal promises to regain moral authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **GI Generation (Greatest Generation)**: The children of World War II, they were community-oriented and voted overwhelmingly for FDR and the New Deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:02:00">[40:02:00]</a>. They were builders of institutions and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:34:00">[40:34:00]</a>. As they aged, they received substantial material rewards like Social Security and Medicare, often in exchange for ceding cultural ground to the Boomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.
*   **Generation X**: Defined the Third Turning era, characterized as cynical, pragmatic, and survivalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. They were often told they were "destined to be losers," leading them to want to be different from their peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. In the current Fourth Turning, they will be the leaders making hard decisions, motivated by the Millennials' desire for order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:39:00">[54:39:00]</a>.

### Global Synchronization of Cycles
Major synchronous historical events can align [[Demographic changes and their impact | generational cycles]] across national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. The Great Depression and World War II, for instance, were a "Fourth Turning" for most of the world, leading to a synchronized "youth Awakening" around 30-40 years later in places like Paris, Berlin, Rome, Prague, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:56:00">[22:56:00]</a>.

## Outcomes of a Crisis Turning

Successfully navigating a Fourth Turning can lead to a society that emerges "reborn, more equal, more optimistic, and more united" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Societal Transformation
The end of a Fourth Turning, leading into a First Turning, brings significant societal shifts:
*   **From Individualism to Community**: A fundamental shift towards collective action and cohesion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
*   **From Privilege to [[generational_power_shifts_and_inequality | Equality]]**: Society becomes more equal not just in economic measures, but in its social ethic, where fitting in and being helpful is prized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
*   **From Defiance to Authority**: Leaders become more authoritative, and people are more likely to trust and follow experts, recognizing its importance for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.
*   **From Deferral to Permanence**: Social problems that were previously deferred are permanently invested in and alleviated through new institutions and infrastructure. This is done not just to solve current problems but to prevent future ones, such as the post-WWII creation of the UN, IMF, and World Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>.
*   **From Irony to Convention**: A cultural shift where new artistic and social expressions are initially modest and conventional, only to open floodgates later during the subsequent Awakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

> "We never solve our biggest problems on bright sunny days when everyone feels comfortable. We always do it on dark stormy nights when our backs are against the wall." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>

This cyclical nature means that while problems seem insurmountable during a Fourth Turning, the pressure of crisis allows for the creation of new constitutions, federal currency, and social security, radically shaping the national community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

### Economic Implications
Fourth Turnings often lead to greater [[Demographic changes and their economic implications | economic equality]] through the devaluation or confiscation of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. Inflation is common as governments rack up huge liabilities, which are then repudiated through inflation as a means of reducing debt burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. This makes nominal fixed-income assets problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

### The Role of Conflict
A Fourth Turning is characterized by conflict, which can manifest as internal civil conflict or an existential external threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. An external conflict can potentially wipe away internal divisions and unite a country, as seen during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. Historically, great Fourth Turning crises have both external and internal dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

> "There's nothing worse than a fourth turning, except not having a fourth turning." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>

The ongoing Fourth Turning is expected to see a full resolution in the early 2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. This period, while challenging, is expected to transform society in ways currently unimaginable, solving problems like homelessness, gun violence, healthcare, and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:41">[01:08:41]</a>. These transformations are enabled by a renewed sense of collective purpose and the urgency of crisis.

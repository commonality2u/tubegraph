Natural resource markets, including commodities, are highly cyclical, volatile, and capital-intensive. Success in this area often requires an instinctive contrarian approach, patience, and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Influences

The concept of ESG investing is viewed critically from a market-centric perspective, particularly regarding who defines "responsible" practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.

### Environmental (E) Concerns
The "E" in ESG raises questions about prioritizing certain environmental practices over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. For example, some policies advocate for organic gardening, which may increase labor costs and reduce land productivity, potentially forcing the conversion of land used for environmental purposes into food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. In extractive industries, the focus on capital-intensive but environmentally safe methods is preferred over less regulated artisanal extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

### Social (S) Considerations
The "S" in ESG brings up disparities in global living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. It highlights that a billion people worldwide lack access to primary electricity, and 300 million have calorie consumption below 1400 calories per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. The question arises whether ESG should focus on improving the material lives of these people, bringing them closer to the standards of wealthier nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Governance (G) Questions
Regarding governance, the discussion questions whether debt and deficits, which finance current consumption at the expense of future generations, constitute good governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>. There is a preference for ESG to be defined by market forces rather than by "big thinkers" who may impose their values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

### Shifting Landscape of ESG
Recent trends indicate a potential shift in the market's reception of ESG. Vanguard has made changes in its ESG stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>, and some iShares funds have experienced significant outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. Additionally, the amount of private equity raised by climate startups has dropped by 40% year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. These suggest a potential "pushback" against the current ESG narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

[[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | Geopolitical factors]], particularly those related to national politics and international relations, significantly impact natural resource markets.

### Political Influence on Inflation
Inflation is primarily understood as a political phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>. The tendency for electorates to vote for immediate benefits and for governments to run up debt and deficits creates a burden on future generations, contributing to inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. Artificially low or negative real interest rates are seen as a political mechanism to transfer wealth from savers to spenders, a policy popular among the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

### Geopolitical Risks in Investment
Investing in natural resources often involves significant [[geopolitical influences on financial markets | political risk]], especially in countries facing instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. For example, a historical investment in Congo (Democratic Republic of Congo) between 1994 and 2000 occurred during a tumultuous period of civil war, health crises (malaria, AIDS, Ebola), and widespread starvation due to disrupted supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Despite these risks, the underlying natural resources remained valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The investment in Tenke Fungurume, one of the world's largest undeveloped copper deposits, demonstrates how high political risk can lead to low valuations and significant upside when conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[01:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Deglobalization and Supply Chains
The world is experiencing a shift away from globalization, leading to questions about supply chain resilience and technology access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>. For example, concerns about Airbus running out of aluminum due to sanctions on Russia, or Russia losing production capabilities without Western technology, reflect these tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>. However, markets tend to adapt; if the West is unwilling to supply technology, other countries like China or India will eventually fill the void, albeit with a time lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:23">[01:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:29">[01:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:31">[01:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>.

### Weaponization of the US Dollar
The "weaponization" of the US dollar, where the US imposes its political preferences extraterritorially through financial systems like Swift, has led other countries (e.g., China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, India) to seek alternatives to dollar reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>. This drive for de-dollarization is a significant factor behind central banks' increased gold purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:23">[00:58:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>.

## Impact on Commodity Markets

### Underinvestment and Supply Crunch
Despite some current policies, the world is facing a potential supply crunch across various extractive industries due to systemic underinvestment in natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. This includes oil, gas, copper, cobalt, and zinc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Decades of underinvestment, combined with rising global demand driven by increasing material living standards for 8 billion people, create classic conditions for price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

### Inflationary Pressures and Commodity Prices
Inflation, while generally negative for humankind, can increase the relative performance of commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. High inflation significantly raises the cost of establishing new productive capacity in capital-intensive industries, making existing assets more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Inflation also acts as a barrier to entry for new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
The dynamics of commodity prices, particularly in the context of inflation, are tied to [[supply_and_demand_dynamics_in_natural_resources | supply and demand dynamics in natural resources]]. Global macro series often explore these influences, seeking to understand the interplay of economic shifts, inflation, and commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

### Historical Commodity Bull Markets
Two major commodity bull markets in recent history are noted:
*   **1969-1981**: This period saw nearly all commodities increase by 10 to 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This coincided with 30-40 years of underinvestment in productive capacity following the Great Depression and World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
*   **2000-2011**: This boom was driven by two factors: 20 years of prior underinvestment in natural resources (leading to capacity constraints) and the economic growth and urbanization of China (creating a demand pull) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

A new commodity bull market is anticipated, largely due to continued systemic underinvestment by society in natural resources and the rising global population's desire for improved living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. However, a synchronized global recession or depression could dampen these price expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

## Gold and Precious Metals in the Current Climate

Precious metals, particularly gold, are considered insurance for maintaining purchasing power during periods of economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.

### Investor Ownership and Market Share
US investor ownership in precious metals is currently very low, around 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>. The long-term mean is about 2%, with historical highs of 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. This low market share suggests a potential for reversion to the mean, which would quadruple demand for precious metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>.

Gold historically performs well when there are concerns about the purchasing power of conventional savings instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. Negative real interest rates, such as the US 10-year Treasury yielding 3.75% while inflation is 7.5%, effectively reduce purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

The shift from a 40-year period of declining nominal interest rates to higher rates impacts bond portfolios and may lead to a "disintermediation" from long-term bonds into other asset classes, including gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:13">[00:54:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:29">[00:54:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

### Gold Mining Industry
The gold mining sector is currently viewed as a favorable investment due to its competitive pricing based on the net present value of future cash flows from reserves and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:17">[01:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:27">[01:03:27]</a>. The "best 12 miners" are considered to be at their cheapest level in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:25">[01:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

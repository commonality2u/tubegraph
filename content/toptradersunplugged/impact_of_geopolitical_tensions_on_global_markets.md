Geopolitical events and their resulting tensions are identified as a major force influencing global markets, with their structural importance expected to impact the next five to ten years significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. This influence is seen through various lenses, including inflation, market structure, and global trade relationships.

## Key Observations on [[Geopolitical Tensions and Global Conflicts]]

*   **Acceleration of Issues** The year 2022 saw an unexpected acceleration of [[Geopolitical influences on financial markets | geopolitical issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. While the prospect of [[Geopolitical Tensions and Global Conflicts | geopolitical strife]] was anticipated due to rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and the deepening "bifurcation" between China and the U.S., were unforeseen in their intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.
*   **Structural Shifts** These geopolitical changes are fundamentally altering global market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. The past 24 years of market stability were partly due to globalization, specifically the integration of billions from China and India into the global economy, which acted as a significant deflationary force, enabling the Federal Reserve to stimulate markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.
*   **Reversal of Deflationary Forces** Now, these "structurally deflationary forces" are slowing and potentially coming to an abrupt halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This means a move away from the long period where the Fed had absolute control and could easily reduce volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>.
*   **Impact on Inflation** The Russia-Ukraine conflict has specifically played a role in increasing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>. The continued relationship between China and the U.S., marked by resource scarcity, is accelerating inflationary effects from labor, commodity, currency, and funding perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.
*   **De-globalization** De-globalization is identified as a critical trend, accelerating faster than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Western economies are not currently built to operate in an increasingly adversarial global relationship, requiring significant on-boarding of production capabilities domestically that have been outsourced for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. This shift will have powerful structural inflationary effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

## Outlook

Until a "pivot from China" — such as a reopening or a shift away from backing Russia — things are expected to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. There are currently no signs that China will change course, nor that the West will permit such a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. If the "Taiwan thing" comes to pass, it is believed things will get even worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

Market participants often have short memories regarding these deep structural shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.

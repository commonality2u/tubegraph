Politics can be understood as the process by which "eight billion small blood-sucking insects each trying to suck out the life juices from the other while defending oneself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This cynical view underpins how political phenomena significantly influence financial markets and investment strategies.

## Politics and Economic Phenomena
Inflation, for instance, is primarily a political phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. Historically, people tend to vote for "free beer and a free lunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>, seeking to extract benefits while defending against others' extractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

### Government Policy and Spending
Artificially low interest rates are seen as a political phenomenon, part of a "war by Spenders on savers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>, where the more numerous spenders often win in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Governments spending more money than they have, burdening future generations with the costs of current consumption, is also a politically driven behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. This leads to massive aggregate liabilities, such as the United States' nearly $100 trillion in net present value of unfunded liabilities (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>, serviced by a budget that is itself $2 trillion annually in deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

This approach to fiscal policy can constrain the credit capabilities of societies and increase the risk of default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. The continuous quantitative easing is likened to "government speak for counterfeiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, further highlighting the [[impact_of_government_policy_on_markets | impact of government policy on markets]].

### Geopolitical Influences and Conflict
Inflationary periods are often correlated with resource scarcity and increased global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>. This is partly due to populism, where countries prioritize feeding their own people, leading to competition and potentially war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

A significant [[geopolitical_influences_on_financial_markets | geopolitical influence on financial markets]] is the "weaponization of the US dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a> by the US Congress, which has attempted to impose its political preferences extraterritorially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. This has driven central banks in countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and Mexico to abandon reliance on the US dollar and the Swift banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, opting for other bilateral or multilateral standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>. This phenomenon highlights the [[impact_of_globalization_and_global_conflict_on_investments | impact of globalization and global conflict on investments]] and [[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | geopolitical impacts on global markets]].

Regarding deglobalization and supply chain issues (e.g., Airbus running out of aluminum due to Russia, Russia losing Western technology access) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>, it is noted that while such issues might occur for a couple of years, markets tend to find solutions over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. If demand exists and someone is willing to pay, technology will be developed to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.

## ESG and Political Agendas
The ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) movement is viewed critically, particularly the "E" (environment) and "S" (social) aspects, when driven by "big thinkers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. Concerns are raised about turning away from efficient agricultural methods in favor of less productive ones, potentially increasing land conversion for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. From a social perspective, questions arise about how "big thinkers" reconcile a billion people lacking primary electricity or 300 million with insufficient calorie consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Governance is questioned when it involves "spawning of envy" or accumulating debt on the backs of future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

There is a perceived "pushback" against the politics of extinction, especially when figures like those at Davos tell people to drive less while flying private jets themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. The argument is made that environmental preservation improves when societies become wealthier, as environmental quality can become a consumer good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in a Changing Political Landscape
Given the politically influenced economic environment, investors must adapt their [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment strategies in a changing economic landscape]].

> "To be successful in the commodities business you need to be an instinctive contrarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.
>
> "The commodities either bore you or torture you for long periods of time... and then they make up for that period of boredom and torture with spectacular returns over short periods of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

This requires patience and tenacity, as markets for commodities are difficult to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. The speaker, a seasoned investor, learned that they were "not Buffett" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>, needing insurance (like gold) against economic uncertainties and negative real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.

The market share of precious metals in the United States is currently half a percent, compared to a long-term mean of two percent and a high of six percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>. This suggests a potential for quadrupled demand if the market reverts to its statistical mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. This is linked to concerns about inflation and the inability of conventional savings instruments like the U.S. 10-year Treasury to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

Gold classically performs well when there are concerns about the maintenance of purchasing power in other forms of savings and investment assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. The current environment of inflation with persistently low interest rates drives these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

Ultimately, market forces tend to work even when political narratives aim to control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The "narrative always gives way to arithmetic, just not always quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>.

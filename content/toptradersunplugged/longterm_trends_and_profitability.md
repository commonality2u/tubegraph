Systematic investing offers a dependable and consistent approach often overlooked in the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach allows investors to [[global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | take the pulse of the global market through the lens of a rules-based investor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Power of Trend Following

[[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | Trend following]] is a strategy designed to make the most money, acknowledging its power and occasional paranoia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. While the "buy and hold" strategy has seen significant losses, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling for eight consecutive weeks (a streak not seen since 1923) and the S&P experiencing its longest losing streak since 2001, [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] offers an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Even Bitcoin has seen its most consecutive weekly losses in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Current market challenges, such as rising costs and weak earnings reports from major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Target, highlight the difficulty of traditional investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. However, [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | macroeconomic factors]] like inflation, which Milton Friedman described as "always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon," also influence market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Despite the Fed's potential influence, investors may need to be patient for market bailouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The market's current behavior, with rallies occurring even in bear markets, is reminiscent of 2008, where significant daily upward moves were observed amidst a 50% retracement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This suggests a shift from "buy the dip" to "sell the rally" may be occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

The year 2021 was identified as a potentially significant turning point for equity markets, based on a Fibonacci sequence analysis of market tops and bottoms dating back to 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This perspective suggests that the bear market in both bonds and equities could continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

One concern for investors is a potential loss of confidence in central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The end of an era of globalization may also lead to significant consequences for strategies like risk parity and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. However, such periods are expected to generate many trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Pyramiding vs. Diversified Systems

The concept of "pyramiding" in [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following]] can be misunderstood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. True [[longterm_trading_systems | long-term trend following]] involves defining risk per market (e.g., one unit) and allocating it across multiple independent systems (e.g., four systems with 25% of a unit each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. These systems, each with its own entry and exit rules (e.g., 20-day, 40-day, 60-day, 80-day breakouts), are treated independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The term "pyramiding" misleadingly suggests that subsequent trades are based on prior trade outcomes or that risk increases with open profit, which is not the case in this rules-based approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Micro-managing entries by spreading them out over a day, even if they occur simultaneously, actually underperforms simply executing the system trade when instructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## Single Stocks and Diversification

In contrast to early 2020 when many asset classes moved in the same direction, recent years have shown significant differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Single stocks, particularly those chosen for their diversifying characteristics (like Beyond Meat or Canopy Growth), began downtrending before major indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This highlights that while a broad market downtrend can affect everything, a diversified portfolio with both long and short positions across various sectors (commodities, currencies, interest rates, stocks, and country ETFs) can provide better risk control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Even [[longterm_trading_systems | long-term trading systems]] will exit positions like Tesla or Moderna when they enter a defined downtrend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## The Importance of Sample Size and Simplicity

When applying [[longterm_trading_systems | long-term trend following]], it's crucial to use all available markets and treat them uniformly for both long and short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. There isn't enough historical data, especially for newer markets like crypto, to optimize parameters for individual markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. An in-sample/out-of-sample testing approach, where parameters are optimized on past data and then applied to future data, often shows that optimized parameters do not remain robust over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. The best approach is to use all data for all markets, as every market generally has a long bias, and deep dives for special rules are often detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>.

A common pitfall is over-complicating [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. Simpler systems have historically been more successful among managers with long track records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>. One key element is the diversification of markets; [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] may not yield fantastic results if applied only to a limited number of markets, such as equities, fixed income, or a single commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. The "secret sauce" of [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] is its application across many diverse markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

Using too much data to find specific market characteristics or biases for every single market is not supported by sufficient data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. While each market has a long bias and can generate significant profits (e.g., 400-600 ATR profit), shorts generally do not perform as well but provide crucial diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Handling Outliers and Consistency

In extreme outlier events, such as a 95% drop in a market like Luna, manual intervention to close a position can be justified, even if it deviates from strict rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. This is because there's limited downside remaining, and the risk of a bounce-back is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. This type of infrequent, significant intervention can be more robust than daily implementations of non-robust profit-taking or volatility reduction rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. For instance, closing a short Russian stock ETF position when it seemed to have minimal further downside was a justified decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.

[[systematic_trend_following_strategies_and_performance | Systematic trend following strategies]] using a single entry, single exit, and stop loss, without attempts to smooth returns or manage volatility, can lead to surprising consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Historical backtesting of such systems has shown periods with no losing calendar years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. This consistency, despite potentially large drawdowns or lumpiness in returns, stems from allowing outliers to run to their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.

In contrast, methods that try to smooth returns through [[risks_and_trends_in_current_investment_strategies | volatility management]] or correlation management may sacrifice the ability to capture these large, infrequent outliers, which are essential for maximizing compounded annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>. The core of [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] is letting profits run, and overly complex approaches or those that try to predict markets tend not to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

## Measuring Success

Metrics like the Sharpe Ratio are often misapplied to individual investments rather than portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. More importantly, the Sharpe Ratio does not account for the actual risk of capital loss, only return over volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. The primary goal is to stay in the game and preserve capital, allowing the positively expected system to play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>. A classic [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following]] approach, while potentially having higher volatility and lumpiness, is considered robust and capable of long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

Just as no one asks about the Sharpe Ratio of the S&P 500 or Warren Buffett's performance, the ability to withstand market fluctuations and remain in business for the long term is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. Simple [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following]] has shown consistent outperformance, even recently, compared to more complex strategies like AI and machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>.

[[challenges_and_benefits_of_longterm_trading_horizons | The challenges and benefits of longterm trading horizons]] for trend followers are evident. While a simplified approach to [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following]] may appear "underappreciated" because it sounds less complex, it has consistently delivered results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. The crucial point is that a robust approach to [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] can perform well over many years and diverse market scenarios, even with slight variations among managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.

The key to long-term profitability in [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] lies in adhering to its core principles:
*   Allowing profits to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:28">[01:19:28]</a>.
*   Embracing the impact of outliers, which overwhelm any negative effects of drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.
*   Prioritizing robustness and the ability to stay in business over minimizing volatility or drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:43">[01:19:43]</a>.

The [[systematic_trend_following_strategies and performance | systematic trend following strategies]] continue to show strong performance, with the BTOP 50 index up 15.25% for the year, the CTA index up 20%, and the Trend index leading at almost 27% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:40">[01:22:40]</a>. This contrasts sharply with broader markets like MSCI, which is down 17.8% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.

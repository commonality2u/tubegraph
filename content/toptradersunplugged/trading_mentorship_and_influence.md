The journey of a successful trader and asset manager is often shaped by significant mentors and influential firms, providing invaluable [[lessons_from_successful_traders_and_the_role_of_discipline_and_commitment_in_trading | lessons]] and shaping core philosophies. Chris Cruden, founder and CEO of Inch Capital Management, reflects on a career spanning decades, highlighting the profound impact of key individuals and organizations on his approach to systematic trading and business management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Early Career and Foundational Influences

Chris Cruden began his career as a British Army officer, commissioned into the Gordon Highlanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. After leaving the army, he found himself in South Africa without a job when peace was declared in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He secured a position as a gold analyst at a bank called Sai Fruits Life (now part of Nedbank), despite having no prior knowledge of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. His Scottish boss, Mr. MacTaggert, simply instructed him to understand the difference between the market price and the cost of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

This early exposure led him to Dean Witter Reynolds in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, where he worked under Ken Tropin, who later founded Graham Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Dean Witter was a dominant force in identifying and supporting emerging managers in the managed futures industry, which in those days preceded the term "hedge funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. They achieved significant success, including a new offering of approximately $250 million that was oversubscribed by more than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

After the 1988 market crash, Cruden returned to London and joined AHL (now part of Man Group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. AHL, co-founded by Michael Adam, David Harding, and Martin Lueck, became a major source of inspiration and talent for European managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Cruden notes that AHL and his colleagues at the time viewed Mint as their "heroes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The belief was that by adding more markets, increasing diversification, and becoming more [[systematic_trading_vs_expert_intuition | systematized]], they could replicate Mint's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. AHL's endeavor to become more systematic was a significant draw for Cruden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## The Mentorship of Bob Tamiso

A pivotal influence for Chris Cruden came from his years working with Bob Tamiso, whom he describes as a "guiding light" and "great mentor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Tamiso was an "extraordinarily systematic trader" and a "systematic man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This systematic approach, based on solid understanding rather than predictive insight, strongly appealed to Cruden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

A core philosophy imparted by Tamiso was the importance of "showing up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This means maintaining presence in the market by avoiding financial ruin, often linked to excessive leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. Tamiso believed that most people fail because they are unable to meet this minimum requirement, often due to being "over geared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Tamiso's close friend, Larry Hite (featured in "Market Wizards"), also influenced this perspective, frequently visiting their office in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Both Tamiso and Hite were entirely systematic and did not claim "greatness by pretending that they knew tomorrow's prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

At Tamiso's firm, they intentionally chose the interbank foreign exchange market for their program, Kintyre, believing that the managed futures markets were becoming too crowded, easily spooked, and over-leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Tamiso famously said, "the great thing about currency markets is they're so big that we can't screw them up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This selective approach, focusing on a less crowded, professional market, was a key driver of Kintyre's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Tamiso's firm was highly successful in terms of returns and asset raising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Despite this, their operation was remarkably simple: there was no price feed in the office, and trades were executed by phone and fax once a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This simplicity and the ability to be highly successful without complex technology informed Cruden's later views on high-frequency trading and nanosecond systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Tamiso was driven by a "quality of life" philosophy, presenting himself as a "successful and balanced individual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This contrasted with the "frantic almost foaming at the mouth grabiness of some managers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. They were content with their operations and had no aspiration to take on an "awful lot more clients or an awful lot more money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Tamiso was very clear about who he wanted to do business with and who he did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

## Founding Inch Capital Management

After parting ways with Tamiso (who was much older) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>, Cruden returned to the UK and later relocated to Switzerland in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, starting Inch Capital Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. The establishment of Inch was "almost entirely accidental," as Cruden initially didn't intend to go back into business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

Inch's culture reflects many of the lessons learned:
*   **Systematic and Disciplined:** The firm's programs are entirely [[philosophies_of_systematic_trading | systematic trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.
*   **Low Leverage:** Inch uses low leverage, ranging from 1:1 to 3:1, to ensure they can "show up again tomorrow" and avoid losing all their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
*   **Removal of Emotion and Ego:** Cruden believes that people lose money due to emotion (hope, greed, fear) and ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. Removing these through a set of rules provides an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.
*   **Simplicity over Perceived Cleverness:** Cruden emphasizes simplicity, stating that their rules are "remarkably simple" and can be understood without being "terribly clever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. He challenges others to write their complex systems on a single sheet of paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.
*   **Flat Hierarchy:** Inch is "not hierarchical in any sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>, with low employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Cruden delegates and trusts his team, viewing himself as a "manager of money not managers of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>.
*   **Modest Growth Aspiration:** Like Tamiso, Cruden and Inch are "not unhappy with where we are" in terms of size, prioritizing performance over aggressive asset gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. He admits to being "hopeless at marketing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

Ultimately, Cruden's [[Diverse Trading Experiences | diverse experiences]] and the mentorship from figures like Bob Tamiso instilled in him the core belief that success in trading comes from a disciplined, systematic approach, managed with humility and a long-term perspective, ensuring the ability to "show up again tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

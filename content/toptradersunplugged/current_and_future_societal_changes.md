Societal changes can be understood through **generational cycles** that influence the public mood and last approximately the length of one human life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. These cycles are divided into four distinct eras, known as "turnings," each lasting 20 to 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## The Four Turnings Explained

### First Turning (The High)
A First Turning is a generational era that follows the resolution of a Fourth Turning crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. It redefines the country constitutionally, politically, and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. In this period:
*   **Institutions are strong**, while individualism is weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   A strong ethic of **social conformity** prevails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   People are modest about themselves and make efforts to fit in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   Conformity is prized, and there is a rising ethic and reality of **equality** in income and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
*   Society can solve huge problems, with a great sense of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   The post-World War II period (Truman, Eisenhower, John Kennedy presidencies) is an example of a First Turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This era saw balanced budgets, surpluses, large infrastructure projects like interstate highways, and rapid growth in the standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:40]</a>.

### Second Turning (The Awakening)
The Second Turning is characterized by a rebellion against social conformity, rules, regulations, and social discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   Known as the "Consciousness Revolution," it occurred from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.
*   It began in inner cities and college campuses, challenging authorities and conventions around personal and cultural behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:22]</a>.
*   It led to throwing off social obligations, increased deficits, and a reduced interest in building big, lasting institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:03]</a>.
*   This period saw a shift from focusing on the "outer world" (large civic projects) to the "inner world" (personal problems and growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.
*   Society became more individualized, less governed, less conformist, and increasingly less equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.
*   [[Demographic changes and their impact | Boomers]] came of age during this era, defining its mood by rejecting the middle class and emphasizing personal freedom over collective living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

### Third Turning (The Unraveling)
The Third Turning is marked by strong individualism and weak institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>.
*   It roughly spanned from the mid-1980s up to the [[risks_and_potential_changes_in_global_financial_systems | Global Financial Crisis (GFC)]] in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.
*   Decades within this turning, such as the "Roaring 90s," are characterized by weak civic authority, cynicism, and bad manners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.
*   Generation X, coming of age during this period, defined the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.
*   The prevailing idea was that markets and individualism would spread globally, with governments fading away, leading to "deracinated individuals Nomads contracting with each other on our computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>.

### Fourth Turning (The Crisis)
A Fourth Turning is a period of exceptional upheaval and conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   It begins with multiple crises and culminates in increasingly severe, organized conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
*   During this time, new institutions are born, and a new Republic emerges from the resolution of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>.
*   Past Fourth Turnings include the Great Depression and World War II, the American Civil War, and the American Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   Society enters a Fourth Turning with almost no order or security, and the public increasingly desires order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>.

## The Current Fourth Turning

The current Fourth Turning is believed to have started with the [[risks_and_potential_changes_in_global_financial_systems | Global Financial Crisis (GFC)]] in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

### Catalyst and Regeneracy
The GFC served as a catalyst, similar to the Black Thursday crash of October 1929, which also ushered in the last Fourth Turning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:03:00">[30:03:00]</a>. Financial crashes have historically been related to the timing of earlier Fourth Turnings, such as the crash of 1857 before Lincoln's election and the London crash of 1772 leading to the Boston Tea Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:25:00">[30:25:00]</a>.

The "regeneracy," a phase where people move beyond initial shock and distrust to refine themselves into larger groups, was evident in the 2016 US election (Trump-Clinton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>. This election marked a long-term shift for the Republican Party toward populism, particularly around education as a differentiator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>.

### Intensifying Polarization
Intense polarization is a characteristic of Fourth Turnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. People are sorting themselves geographically into different communities, leading to elections where only a few states are contested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:00">[37:21:00]</a>. The desire to avoid living next to someone with opposing political views is stronger than avoiding those of a different race or religion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:42:00">[37:42:00]</a>. This polarization is a reaction to the lack of certainty, as people seek security by finding their "tribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21:00">[36:21:00]</a>.

### Generational Dynamics
*   [[Demographic changes and their impact | Millennials]] (the generation that coined by Neil Howe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>) crave order, social guarantees, and generally prefer less risk than [[demographic_changes_and_their_impact | Boomers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:06]</a>. They are peer-oriented and community-oriented, flocking to social media that provides constant feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>. They exhibit a turning away from democracy, seeing it as proceduralism that prevents real change, contributing to the rise of populist and authoritarian leaders globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.
*   [[Demographic changes and their impact | Boomers]], by contrast, have remained a generation of risk-takers, often living solo and not caring if they know their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>.
*   [[Demographic changes and their impact | Generation X]] (Gen X) individuals, coming of age during the unraveling, are described as cynical, pragmatic, and survivalist, focused on getting the job done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:58:00">[55:58:00]</a>. They will likely be the leaders making hard decisions in this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:39:00">[54:39:00]</a>. They are raising their own children (Post-Millennials) very protectively, the opposite of their own "free-range" childhoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>.

### Global Alignment of Cycles
[[Impact of historical events on generational shifts | Generational cycles]] are increasingly global because major historical events are becoming synchronous across national boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.
*   The last Fourth Turning (Great Depression, World War II) was global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>.
*   The youth Awakening (1960s-1970s) was also global, with youth rebellion against strong institutions seen in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Prague, China (Red Guard), and Mexico City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.
*   While the US has the longest and most regular track record of these turnings due to its founding principles, this phenomenon is increasingly observed elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Resolution

The current Fourth Turning is estimated to last until the early 2030s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:32:00">[58:32:00]</a>. The peak of the crisis can lead to either continued internal conflict (like the Civil War) or a unifying external threat that resolves internal divisions (like World War II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>.

### Economic and Fiscal Implications
*   [[Future economic challenges and crises | Fourth Turnings]] often involve increasing volatility in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:55:00">[59:55:00]</a>.
*   Governments are expected to become more aggressive in controlling markets and marshaling resources, including private resources, to address conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:04:00">[59:04:00]</a>.
*   The end of a Fourth Turning typically brings greater [[demographic_changes_and_their_economic_implications | equality]], partly through the devaluation, confiscation, or destruction of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:26:00">[59:26:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation** is a common consequence as governments rack up huge liabilities and use inflation to repudiate debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:56:00">[59:56:00]</a>. The US public debt is already very high, reaching 100% of GDP by the fiscal year, a level similar to the end of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.
*   Unlike past crises, where there was significant "fiscal room" for government expansion (e.g., from 5% to 20% of GDP), the current government is already large and primarily an "insurance company with an army" rather than a civic-oriented entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. This means a "triage" will be necessary, where [[future_economic_outlook_and_fiscal_challenges | Boomers]] and [[demographic_changes_and_their_impact | Gen X]] are expected to voluntarily give up fiscal promises to regain moral authority, provided younger generations step up to keep the country together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. This is the opposite dynamic of the Awakening, where the GI Generation gave up cultural control in exchange for material rewards for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>.

### Societal Transformation and Solutions
If successfully navigated, a Fourth Turning leads to a rebirth of society, becoming "more equal, more optimistic, and more united" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Problems that seem intractable today can be solved** rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   Major shifts include:
    *   From **individualism to community** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>.
    *   From **privilege to equality**, both in measurable terms and in social ethic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
    *   From **defiance to authority**, where leaders are trusted and followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.
    *   From **deferring social problems to permanently investing in alleviating them**, building new infrastructure not just to solve current issues but to prevent future ones (e.g., post-WWII creation of the UN, IMF, World Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:48">[01:11:48]</a>.
    *   From **irony to convention** in culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:22">[01:13:22]</a>.

These deep transformations arise during "dark stormy nights" when societies are "against the wall," leading to the creation of new constitutions, federal currencies, and social security systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:49">[01:12:49]</a>. While such periods involve greater conformity and some loss of individualism, they are seen as "new Golden Ages" where younger generations feel energized and optimistic, building a new world they believe is vastly superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:22">[01:15:22]</a>. The challenges faced by societies during this period ultimately foster the creation of competent and livable communities capable of carrying out common tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:22">[01:18:22]</a>.

The [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold market]] is viewed as fundamentally different from the base metals market, influenced by unique supply and demand trends, and gold's distinct role in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

## Gold's Role and Valuation
Gold functions as an asset that experiences cycles of favor and disfavor, cheapness and expensiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Currently, gold is considered "really cheap relative to financial assets" and has historically outperformed when cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Based on the amount of money printed and market capitalization, gold is as inexpensive today as it has ever been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. A fair valuation for gold is estimated to be closer to $10,000 per ounce, given the money printed in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Historically, the ratio of US dollars printed to the Treasury's gold holdings has remained within a consistent band, indicating gold's current undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

## Investor Behavior and Central Bank Activity
In 2020, when oil prices were extremely low, the gold-to-oil ratio suggested a heavy weighting towards energy and away from gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. However, by 2022, following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the ratio indicated a return to precious metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

During the rate hike cycle of 2022 and 2023, Western investors sold gold due to rising real rates, leading to significant liquidation of gold from ETFs (around 800 tons) and poor performance of gold stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Conversely, central banks began stepping in to buy gold, absorbing more than what Western speculators were selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This dynamic caused gold prices to rise from just over $1,600 an ounce in late 2022 to an all-time high of $2,500 an ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

Despite the rise in gold prices, gold stocks have not kept pace because central banks do not buy gold equities, creating a "no bid" situation for these stocks and a significant value opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Western speculators have just started to return to the [[gold_investment_trends_and_central_bank_activities | gold market]], with shares outstanding of major gold-holding ETFs ticking higher, though gold equity ETFs have not yet seen similar increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Cycles and Catalysts
[[Gold and commodity cycles | Commodity markets]] move in long cycles, often referred to as "super cycles," which are primarily caused by capital spending cycles in the energy and extractive metals businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Periods of commodity deficit lead to dramatic price increases and supernormal profits for companies, attracting capital and boosting stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Eventually, excessive capital inflow leads to oversupply, price collapse, and plummeting investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Historical analysis shows that major [[market_volatility_and_economic_shifts | shifts]] in global monetary systems have consistently triggered significant commodity bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>:
*   **1929**: The end of the classical gold standard, marked by the reversal of Benjamin Strong's quantitative easing policies, led to a stock market collapse but strong outperformance of natural resource equities over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **1968**: President Johnson's decision to no longer legally mandate the dollar to be backed by gold coincided with a low point for commodities relative to stocks, leading to an "incredible Bull Run" in commodity stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
*   **1999**: A reordering of Southeast Asian and Chinese central bank policies following the Asian currency crisis, leading to a massive outflow of US treasuries to the East, marked another commodity surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

Given these historical precedents, current indicators such as China discussing commodity trades outside the dollar, central banks accumulating gold, and concerns about the dollar's weaponization, suggest that the world is in the "right neighborhood for change in the monetary systems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. This shift, combined with massive [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] events in currencies like the Yen and Dollar, is suspected to be the "ultimate Catalyst" for a reordering that alleviates current valuation imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.

## Gold Mining Companies
Gold stocks are currently as cheap as they have ever been relative to the spot gold price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Using metrics like price-to-NAV and viewing gold companies as a series of call options on the gold price (with the cash cost as the strike price), their valuation is comparable to the lows seen in 1999 and 2015, which were historically excellent times for gold investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

## General Market Positioning
Energy's weighting in the S&P 500 is currently 3.4%, significantly below its long-term average of 10-12% and past bull market peaks of 25-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. This low weighting, coupled with consistent monetary outflows from energy stock ETFs, suggests that investors have minimal exposure to the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. Investor enthusiasm and positioning are nearing the lows of late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

An unwind in [[global_macroeconomic_influences_on_trading_strategies | carry trades]], where commodity markets have served as a "funding mechanism" or "short" to propel the "long" of the global carry trade bubble, could be the beginning of a rethinking of global monetary systems and a catalyst for a bottom in real assets relative to financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>.

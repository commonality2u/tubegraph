The concept of "zombie companies" describes businesses that, despite being unprofitable or having low returns on capital, are kept alive due to favorable financial conditions, particularly ultra-low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:56">[03:35:56]</a>. This phenomenon was first identified with the Savings and Loans associations in the 1980s and became a widespread concern in Japan during the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:34">[03:58:34]</a>.

## Causes and Characteristics
In Japan, "zombification" was linked to banks engaging in "loan forbearance," allowing highly indebted companies with low capital returns to remain in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:12">[03:39:12]</a>. Ultra-low and zero interest rate policies themselves act as a form of loan forbearance, providing a lifeline to struggling firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:49">[03:56:49]</a>.

Organizations like the OECD and the Bank for International Settlements have noted that in countries that experienced severe financial sovereign debt crises, such as Italy and Greece (2010-2011), insolvency rates were unexpectedly low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:11">[03:09:11]</a>. This was largely due to the European Central Bank's (ECB) commitment to "do whatever it takes," which led to a policy of loan forbearance facilitated by very low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>.

## Economic Consequences
The presence of zombie companies has several negative effects on the broader economy:
*   **Higher Costs for Efficient Companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:05">[03:22:05]</a>: More efficient companies within sectors dominated by zombies may face higher interest rates than they otherwise would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:05">[03:33:05]</a>.
*   **Reduced Innovation and Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>: Zombie firms lead to less job creation, reduced investment, and fewer new market entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:24">[03:51:24]</a>. This hinders the process of [[creative_destruction_in_economic_ecosystems | creative destruction]], where inefficient firms exit the market, making way for new, more productive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:57">[03:55:57]</a>.
*   **Stagnant Productivity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>: The proliferation of zombie companies contributes to low returns on capital and stagnant productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This creates a feedback loop where low interest rates beget low growth, and low growth in turn necessitates lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### New Forms of "Zombies"
The phenomenon extends beyond traditional industrial firms to the tech sector. Companies like Uber and WeWork, while not fitting the classic definition of "zombies" (as they are often high-growth), are described as "unicorns" that have yet to turn a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:15">[04:22:15]</a>. Their ability to grow despite unprofitability is fueled by ultra-cheap capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:07">[04:47:07]</a>. This encourages highly speculative investments that may never achieve fruition, leading to a [[Market Selection and Diversification | misallocation of capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:21">[04:18:21]</a>. Many of these Silicon Valley businesses are seen as "casino chips" focused on financial metrics rather than fundamental economic functions, sucking up significant capital in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:51">[04:49:51]</a>.

## Systemic Fragility and Political Discontent
The low interest rate environment, which fosters zombification, can be compared to "fertilizer" that "over fertilizes the environment and lead to sort of in a way weak and fragile a weak and fragile ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This fosters a system with inherent fragilities.

Furthermore, the expansion of global supply chains, facilitated by low interest rates and cheap dollar funding, also contributes to this fragility. While allowing access to cheap labor and dampening inflation, it makes the system vulnerable to shocks like pandemics or geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:24">[05:21:24]</a>. The political backlash from workers facing stagnant wages and job outsourcing is also linked to these economic dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

## Threat to Capitalism
The persistence of zero interest rate policies poses a fundamental threat to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. If interest rates approach zero, the concept of capital, which is the discounted value of future income, diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. When the market system malfunctions due to low productivity, investment, and savings, combined with financial fragility, it necessitates increasing state intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:01">[01:11:01]</a>. This leads to a "creeping advance of what you might call some Central Bank capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.

For capitalism to work, it must deliver productivity and economic growth, and allow ordinary people to accumulate capital, buy houses, and save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. Zero interest rates make retirement savings difficult, pushing the "price of security" (like housing or education) out of reach for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. This erodes public support for the system, leading to its atrophy from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.

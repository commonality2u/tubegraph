Effective [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] and [[the_importance_of_position_sizing_and_money_management_in_trading | position sizing]] are crucial for longevity in trading. If worrying about [[risk management in trading | over-risk]] prevents a trader from sleeping at night, it indicates a problem that needs to be addressed during work hours to ensure mental resilience in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Risk Management and Position Sizing

### Portfolio vs. Position Level Risk
While entry signals, exit signals, and [[position_sizing_in_systematic_investing | position sizing]] are typically discussed at the individual position level, the overall result at the portfolio level is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. For diversified systematic models trading many markets and instruments, individual positions are less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. The focus should be on how much gain or loss occurred on the entire portfolio, not on isolated positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Position Sizing Methodology
Traditional "money management strategies" that involve increasing position size based on recent good performance (e.g., pyramiding) are considered illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Past performance does not significantly impact future probabilities, so increasing risk purely due to recent gains is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

A preferred approach involves a variation of volatility [[position_sizing_in_systematic_investing | position sizing]], where a volatility measurement (such as Average True Range, ATR) is used as a proxy for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. Positions are sized based on a target risk level. Since volatility and portfolio value are not static, positions need to be rebalanced at certain intervals or threshold levels to maintain the desired risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

### Stop Losses
The necessity of stop losses varies by trading approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. For equity markets, traditional stop losses may not be used, with other methods employed to halt or close positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. However, for some futures models, particularly counter-trend strategies where large moves can occur, stop losses are considered vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.

### Drawdowns and Investor Expectations
It is crucial for investors to understand the possible and unlikely drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. Simulated drawdowns will likely be smaller than real ones, and real drawdowns may occur sooner than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Communication is key to retaining investors, ensuring they are knowledgeable about the strategy and its risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

Simulations can be used to identify historical worst-case scenarios, but it's important to assume that future events could be worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. A plan for unexpected, "off-the-charts" events (like market disruptions in 2008) is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

### Risk Management in Different Models
*   **Equity Momentum Models**: When trading equities, strategies must account for the primary trend of the overall market index. This means equity models will always be relative models, and significant gains cannot be expected if the market is falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Sector restraints may be considered to prevent excessive concentration in certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.
*   **Futures Models (Trend Following)**: Futures models often rely on "corner risks," which are high risk concentrations in particular areas, such as an entire commodity complex trending heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. While this can lead to large returns, it also implies taking a hit on all correlated positions simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. This is considered a "necessary evil" of diversified trend-following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.

### Organizational Risk Management
For small staff, simple tools like Excel can suffice for understanding and managing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>. However, for larger organizations with 20 or more people, expensive risk systems are needed to aggregate and monitor risk at a company level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### The Role of Systematic Trading
Systematic trading provides a plan for normal market downturns, giving traders clear actions to take regardless of wins or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. However, in extreme, "black swan" events where traditional models might break down (e.g., 2008 financial crisis), additional contingency plans beyond the systematic rules are necessary, such as managing cash holdings when banks are perceived as unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Such events, while previously unimaginable, now highlight the need to plan for anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.

### Important Questions for Investors
When evaluating managers and strategies, investors should ask detailed questions and not be afraid to inquire about secrets or specifics. Good managers are often willing to provide explanations regarding:
*   Attribution of strategy components (e.g., market long/short, sector attribution) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   Examples of trade entries and exits, and the rationale behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.
*   Clear explanations for periods where results deviate from expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>.

A "black box" explanation of "don't worry, just trust me" is unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.

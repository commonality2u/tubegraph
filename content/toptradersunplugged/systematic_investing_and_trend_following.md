The Systematic Investor Series podcast explores the global market through the lens of a rule-based investor, focusing on [[systematic investing | systematic investing]] and highlighting often-overlooked investment strategies that are dependable and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This article summarizes a special group conversation and debate from December 6th, 2022, split into two parts for publication on December 24th and 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## The "Carry Regime" and 2022 Market Dynamics

The year 2022 did not unfold as many experts predicted, frequently being described as "unprecedented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It marked what some describe as the "end of an era" where central banks had full control for the prior two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### The End of the Carry Regime?
A listener, Zach, posed a question about whether the "carry regime" that dominated the past 12 to 14 years has ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This regime was characterized by a stable environment where central banks were fully in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

*   **Transition Period**: Mark Rasmsinski suggests that the market may be in a period of regime transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Carry strategies thrive on dispersion in returns and differences in central bank behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. High volatility or spikes in volatility necessitate exiting carry trades, which can last for months or quarters before opportunities arise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Upside vs. Downside Carry Trade**: Jim discusses the biggest carry trade in the market as upside versus downside, or skew in volatility markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The equity market typically exhibits a "left tail skew" due to the world being "long assets," leading to hedging that creates a supply and demand imbalance, a defining characteristic of all carry trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This has been exacerbated by massive positive flows into investment from zero percent interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Jim believes this regime is "slowing" for the next decade, though the carry trade itself won't disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This is a function of less leverage and a rebalancing/deleveraging of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Ironically, a higher cost of money should reduce the fat tail over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Empirical Evidence for Carry Strategies**: Rob Cava Jameson notes that his cross-asset carry strategy (in futures) has performed poorly for the last 18 months to two years since COVID, but this is not unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Similar poor performance occurred in 2008-2009 and 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, and even worse in the late 1970s, after which carry experienced a 25-30 year bull run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. He doesn't see enough evidence to stop trading carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   He also observed that while carry often performs badly when volatility is high, momentum can perform even worse, making carry relatively well-performing in such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Long-only and Leverage**: Niels Kostrup Larson points out that the "carry regime" discussed in "The Rise of Carry" implied that investors primarily benefited from being long stocks and bonds (ideally with leverage) from 2000 to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Deleveraging and Headwinds**: Jim agrees that carry isn't "dead" but believes the market is experiencing a deleveraging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Unlike 2008, which saw fast deleveraging and quick carry recovery, inflationary periods like the 1970s (where the cost of money rises secularly) lead to long, slow deleveraging and headwinds for carry trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **New Era**: Allan Don suggests a "regime shift" is underway, characterized by a reversal of two- to four-decade trends like declining interest rates, falling inflation, and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Isabel Schnabel of the ECB described this as the "great volatility," replacing the "great moderation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Working for Your Money**: Mark Rasmsinski emphasizes that the era of cheap leverage for buying and holding assets is ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Investors will now "have to work for their money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Why 2022 Was Strong for [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | Trend Following]]
2022 was an exceptionally strong year for [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

*   **Persistent Price Action Across Markets**: [[Trend following investment strategies | Trend following]] performs well with persistent price action across many markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. In 2022, strong trends were observed in bonds, interest rates, and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Favorable Setups**: Particularly in interest rates and bonds, there were favorable setups with strong volatility expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Low volatility at the start of the year meant large position sizing for short signals, leading to particularly strong returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
*   **The "Grind"**: Mark Rasmsinski attributes the success to "the grind," where markets consistently moved lower or higher over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Unlike the rapid decline in March 2020 where models couldn't adjust quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, 2022's slower, persistent moves allowed [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] models to respond effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This "Goldilocks environment" requires movement, but not too much, with enough dispersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. This grind stemmed from consistent central bank policy changes, persistent inflation, and lower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
*   **Secular Shift**: Jim views the "grind" as a secular trend, a rapid acceleration into a new regime that will slow over years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This represents a significant shift from the cyclical moves within a one-way secular trend of the past 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>.
*   **Slower Trends and Correlations**: Niels Kostrup Larson observed that trends unfolded slower in some sectors (interest rates, currencies) and that correlations between markets (e.g., bond-equity) were different than usual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.
*   **All Time Frames Performed Well**: An analysis of [[systematic trend following strategies and performance | systematic trend following strategies and performance]] showed that in 2022, every single time frame, from a few weeks to a couple of years, would have worked, making it unusually pronounced compared to previous standout years like 2008 and 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

### Volatility Strategies and Skew
Jim highlights that 2022 saw cyclical and secular effects aligning in the volatility space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

*   **Cyclical Effects**: After 2020's large volatility move, people crowded into long skew and downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. This caused an oversupply of volatility and hedging, which on the way down, compressed volatility and skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **Secular Effects**: Secularly, the market is moving into a period of less Federal Reserve dominance and higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. Historically, this environment reduces upside trends in markets, kills skew, and makes for a more two-sided market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. The 1960s and 1970s saw markets go nowhere for 14 years in nominal terms, with higher interest rates and more frequent recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>.
*   **Implied vs. Realized Volatility**: Jim anticipates the spread between implied and realized volatility to increase due to less liquidity, creating more opportunities for those in the volatility space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>.
*   **Mean Reversion and Put Writing**: Over longer time frames (5-10 years), Jim expects more mean reversion in markets, a lack of equity performance, and increased opportunities for put writing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. The traditional strategy of rally, big blow-up, rally, big blow-up might not persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:12">[00:50:12]</a>.

## Debate: [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | Trend Following]] vs. Tail Hedge Strategies

The performance of [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic trading and trend following strategies]] in 2022 reignited the discussion about their role as a source of portfolio protection compared to tail hedge strategies.

### Universa's Arguments
Universa published a paper asserting that claims of [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | CTAs]] (Commodity Trading Advisors) being superior for risk mitigation are exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>.

*   **Reliability and Returns**: Universa disputes that [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | CTAs]] reliably achieve positive returns during major stock and bond sell-offs, or that they offer sufficiently large positive long-run returns to justify a portfolio allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. They also argue against the notion that [[trend following in investment strategies | trend following]] is an insurance policy investors are paid to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Declining Performance**: They claim that [[systematic_trend_following_strategies and performance | trend following returns have declined over time]] based on indices like the Berkeley CTA Index and Stock Genie CTA Index (including AQR's managed futures strategy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:44">[00:33:44]</a>. Their analysis of return-to-volatility ratios since the 1980s suggests a decline, though they do not adjust for changes in volatility or interest rates over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
    *   Allan Don counter-argues that the Barclay BTOP50 index's five-year rolling Sharpe ratio was at an all-time high in 2022, contradicting the claim of declining performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Equity Protection**: Universa emphasizes using compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over Sharpe ratio for evaluating portfolio enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. They argue that a meaningful allocation to [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | CTAs]] in the 2010s would have resulted in too great a "drag" for investors to bear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.
    *   Allan Don responds that combining [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | CTAs]] and equities does enhance CAGR and reduce drawdowns, especially if using a higher volatility CTA index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>.
*   **Bonds as Diversification**: Universa's paper suggests that [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | CTAs]] have generated significant profits from long positions in fixed income, implying they behave somewhat like bonds, which they don't believe are good protectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. They also reference a paper by Niederhoffer and Weatherall, which ironically suggested [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | CTAs]] might struggle in a rising yield environment—a scenario that did not play out in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

### AQR's Arguments
AQR's paper, a counterpoint to Universa, focuses on comparing [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] with systematic put buying and tail hedging funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

*   **Drawdown Effectiveness**: AQR argues that while tail hedges work better in short, sharp market downturns, [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] performs better in more prolonged drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   **"Round Trip" Performance**: Accounting for the "round trip" (sell-off and subsequent recovery), AQR finds tail hedges less attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
*   **Full Cycle Returns**: Over the entire market cycle, when considering returns during equity bull markets (where put buying underperforms), [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] looks better than tail hedging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:19">[00:40:19]</a>.

### Panelists' Insights on the Debate
*   **Methodology Concerns**: Rob Cava Jameson found Universa's methodology "appalling" despite some correct general assertions (e.g., [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] is not a panacea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. He suggested AQR's paper would be even stronger if it included both slow and fast [[trend following investment strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
*   **Allocation vs. Strategy Diversification**: Mark Rasmsinski emphasizes the difference between allocation diversification and strategy diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. Bonds were great diversifiers when interest rates were falling, but in a new era with potentially positive stock-bond correlations, strategy diversification becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>.
*   **Data Set Bias**: Jim cautions against analysis that starts in the 1980s (e.g., 1980, 1982, 1984), as it often captures a specific 40-year secular trend that is now transitioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. He believes [[systematic_investing | trend]] will be very good in the new cycle due to an acceleration of new trends and increasing risk premia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from 2022

The year 2022 offered significant lessons for investors and strategists.

*   **Humility and Unpredictability**: Mark Rasmsinski's key takeaway was personal humility and the realization of how little one truly knows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Forecasts, especially a year out, can be extremely poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. He highlights unexpected shifts, like Fed funds rates rising 500 basis points and commodity prices reversing after initial spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.
*   **Follow Price Action**: Given the unpredictability, Mark advocates starting with price action as the basis for forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. While macro trends drive price trends, relying solely on macro predictions can be flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.
*   **Speed of Change**: Allan Don learned that things can happen much more quickly than expected, reflecting "things take longer to happen than you think they will, then they happen faster than you thought they could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. The rapid adjustment to a new regime (e.g., 10% inflation) was a surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.
*   **Prediction of Distribution vs. Direction**: Jim emphasizes that predicting market direction is incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. Instead, it's easier and more profitable to understand the "shape of the distribution" of returns and the forces acting upon it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. The "Rise of Carry" book, for example, speaks to the shape of the distribution, not market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:30">[00:56:30]</a>.
*   **Macro Trends and Demographics**: Jim points to "demographic change" as a very long, deep, and important force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:20">[00:57:20]</a>. The underperformance of younger generations and resulting inequality are driving a demand-push economy and a normalization/mean reversion of market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:30">[00:57:30]</a>.
*   **Trend Following is Predictive, Conditionally**: Mark clarifies that while individuals may struggle with forecasting, [[trend following in investment strategies | trend following]] is not non-predictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. It makes conditional predictions based on the current market regime, providing an edge on the likelihood of future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.
*   **Imagine the Unimaginable**: Niels's key takeaway is the need to be open to imagining the unimaginable in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. Decades of perceived market control had stifled imagination regarding "crazy ways" markets could move, like negative oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

## Crypto and FTX

The discussion shifted to cryptocurrencies and the FTX scandal, exploring crypto's place as an asset class.

*   **Skepticism and Speculative Bubble**: Rob Cava Jameson, a long-time skeptic, believes the "sheen" is coming off the crypto market after the FTX scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. He views it as a "fad" that might eventually be seen like historical bubbles such as the South Sea Bubble or Tulip Mania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **Blockchain's Importance vs. Crypto as Currency**: Jim concurs that crypto is a speculative bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. However, he distinguishes between crypto as a currency (which he thinks is "dead money") and blockchain itself, which he believes is a "secularly important thing" that could drive "web3" and change the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.
*   **Millennial Generation's "Religion"**: Jim argues that crypto is the "religion" of the millennial generation and younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. This generation, growing up with technological innovation, felt they didn't benefit from wealth creation and sought fairness, justice, and a way to "catch up" financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. Their pursuit of speculation, like "YOLO calls" and betting on crypto, expresses their desire for wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
*   **Speculative Asset Behavior**: Allan Don agrees that crypto behaved like a speculative asset in 2022, declining as rates rose and liquidity left the system, essentially trading like a high-beta risk asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. Claims that Bitcoin was a "tail hedge," "inflation hedge," or "digital gold" have been disproven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:42">[01:06:42]</a>.
*   **End of "Ride Bubbles" Era**: Mark Rasmsinski links crypto to the "bubble riders" in the "age of carry," where cheap leverage allowed wealth creation by riding speculative bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>. This era is ending as the cost of leverage increases, forcing people to "earn it" the old-fashioned way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>.
*   **Social Value and Technology**: Mark references Charles Kindleberger's cycle, noting that bubbles can have social value if they push investment capital into new technologies that continue to exist after the bubble bursts, boosting productivity (e.g., railroads in the 1800s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a>. He questions if crypto will follow this path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Importance of Structure, Regulation, and Trust**: The FTX debacle highlights that "structures matter, regulation matters, and trust matters" in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. When these are compromised, trading can halt, and appropriate risk allocation becomes impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:07">[01:10:07]</a>. Even for [[trend following investment strategies | trend followers]], regulation and structure are crucial for effective operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:02">[01:11:02]</a>.
*   **Hopes for Survival**: Niels hopes that parts of crypto survive, but not in its current form, and that "bad actors" and platforms that "pump and dump" the space will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

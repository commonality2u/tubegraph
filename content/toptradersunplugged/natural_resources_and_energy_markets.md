Natural resource and energy markets are currently in the early stages of a significant bull cycle, driven by historical patterns of capital spending and monetary system shifts, despite recent price frustrations and perceived disinterest from Western investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:09">[02:23:09]</a>.

## Commodity Cycles and Capital Spending
Commodities move in large, long cycles, often referred to as "supercycles," though they are fundamentally just prolonged cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:54">[05:37:54]</a>. These cycles are driven by [[supply_and_demand_dynamics_in_natural_resources | capital spending cycles]] in the energy and extractive metals industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:04">[06:10:04]</a>.
*   **Bull Cycle Initiation:** Periods of slight commodity deficit lead to rising prices and supernormal profits for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:22">[06:18:22]</a>. Money flows in, attracting more capital, and stock performance becomes very high, creating a virtuous, reinforcing cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **Delayed Supply Response:** There's a delay from when capital spending occurs to when new supply comes online, often taking years from discovery to production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This delay allows supernormal profits to last longer, leading to over-investment and eventual oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   **Bear Cycle & Collapse:** Too much supply leads to market surplus, collapsing prices, plummeting investor returns, and projects becoming uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Money pours out, and resource stocks can collapse by as much as 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Current State:** The market is in the very early innings of a large bull cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:58">[05:57:58]</a>.
    *   **Investment Collapse:** Capital spending in commodities collapsed between 2010 and 2020, leading to a terrible bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Supply Disruptions:** Depletion takes hold after prolonged under-investment, leading to significant [[global_energy_crisis_and_supply_chain_issues | supply disruptions]] in crude oil, natural gas, and uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Market Outperformance:** Extractive industries, including energy, are showing leadership off their 2020 lows, outperforming even technology sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

### Key Indicators for Market Cycles
Key metrics used to assess commodity cycles include:
*   [[supply_and_demand_dynamics_in_natural_resources | Capital spending cycles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   Energy and metals weighting in various indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   The broad ratio of commodity prices to stock prices, with data extending back 130 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

## Gold and Precious Metals
The gold market is fundamentally different from base metals due to its role as a store of wealth and currency alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Gold is currently as cheap as it has ever been relative to financial assets, considering the amount of money printed and the "everything bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. A fair valuation for gold could be closer to $10,000 an ounce based on historical ratios of US dollars printed to Treasury gold holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:05:00">[19:05:00]</a>.
*   **Investor Behavior:**
    *   **Western Investors:** Typically sell gold when real rates are rising, leading to significant liquidation from ETFs and futures contracts in 2022-2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>. They are just beginning to return to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Central Banks:** Have been accumulating gold at a rapid pace, often buying more than Western speculators were selling, which has driven gold prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.
*   **Gold Stocks:** Gold stocks have not kept pace with the gold price over the last two years because central banks buy physical gold, not gold equities, leaving gold equities without institutional bid and dramatically lagging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. They are currently as cheap as they've ever been relative to the spot gold price, comparable to 1999 and 2015 lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>.

## Copper Market Dynamics
The copper market is viewed with short-term bullishness but longer-term caution by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:51:00">[55:51:00]</a>.
*   **Supply Challenges:**
    *   Mine supply growth was unexpected in the first half of the year, leading to rising inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>.
    *   Copper mining has a long lead time, and new discoveries, reserves, and mines have been near zero for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:15:00">[56:15:00]</a>.
    *   Existing mines face significant base declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:41:00">[56:41:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Trends:**
    *   Demand from countries like India and Indonesia is growing rapidly (up 30% year-on-year) and will be a major tailwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:06:00">[57:06:00]</a>.
    *   The "green revolution" is expected to be a significant driver of additional copper demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>.
    *   China's copper demand:
        *   Historically, China's copper consumption has been on trend line when looking at the total installed copper base, not just annual demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.
        *   However, in the last 6-8 months, China has moved above its copper consumption trend line, potentially due to its green energy push or other factors like military buildups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   **Future Supply Response:** New technologies, particularly in exploration and materials processing, could dramatically reduce the capital intensity of copper mining and lead to a significant supply response later this decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This has historical precedent, such as the SX-EW technology in the 1990s that added 20% to copper supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

## Energy Market Updates
### Natural Gas
*   US natural gas production is plummeting, down 5 BCF per day (5%) in the first seven months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:05">[01:14:05]</a>.
*   Inventories in the US are rapidly repairing, expected to balance by December of this year, significantly faster than earlier predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>.
*   China's gas consumption is behind its trend line relative to its wealth, indicating an unmet demand for LNG that will absorb new US exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a>.

### Oil
*   The recent decline in oil prices (WTI from $80 to $68) is attributed to positioning unwinding by traders rather than fundamental issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.
*   US inventory levels are drawing relative to normal, and the data is strengthening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
*   US shale oil production, including the Permian basin, has rolled over since December, with output down about 1% (150,000 barrels a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This decline in the only source of non-OPEC supply growth is a precursor to a big move higher in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.

### Uranium
*   The uranium market experienced a massive bull market in 2022-2023, attracting speculative money now in the process of exiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   The physical market is extremely tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. Utility buyers lack secondary supply sources, unlike in the past when they could rely on Japanese stockpiles or government weapon decommissioning programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.
*   Hopes for new mines in Kazakhstan and Canada are being delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The next leg up will likely be driven by actual uranium buyers struggling to source pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Geopolitical Factors
### Monetary System Shifts as Catalysts
Historically, major shifts in global monetary systems or regimes have triggered new commodity bull markets and periods of outperformance for resource stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>:
*   **1929:** The end of the classical gold standard, marked by the reversal of Benjamin Strong's quantitative easing policies, led to a huge collapse in the stock market but strong outperformance of natural resource equities over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **1968:** Coincided with President Johnson taking the dollar off gold (preceding Nixon's official closure of the gold window in 1971), marking the effective end of the Bretton Woods exchange standard and the beginning of an incredible bull run for commodity stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **1999:** A complete reordering of Southeast Asian and Chinese central bank policies, which pegged their currencies below market rates to spur exports, resulted in trillions of dollars of treasuries moving East and triggered a commodity bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

Today, signs of another monetary system shift include China's discussions about settling commodity trades outside the dollar, central banks accumulating gold, and concerns about the weaponization of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. These factors suggest the market is in the right "zip code" for significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### Investor Positioning
Investor exposure to natural resources remains very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.
*   Energy's weighting in the S&P 500 is 3.4% as of September 6, 2024, significantly below its long-term average of 10-12% and typical bull market peaks of 25-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. It reached an all-time low of 1.8% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
*   [[Impact of ESG and geopolitical factors on natural resource markets | Monetary outflows]] have been consistent from energy stock ETFs over the last 4-5 years, indicating widespread selling and low investor enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.

### [[strategic_petroleum_reserves_and_global_energy_security | US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)]]
The US SPR was drawn down from 650 million barrels in 2020 to 340 million barrels by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. As of September 2024, it stands at 375 million barrels, showing a slight refill but no longer significant sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.

### Demographics
Demographics represent slow-motion trends that are difficult to forecast precisely, as historical predictions (e.g., Club of Rome's overpopulation fears) have often been confounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>. However, it's clear that China faces a significant demographic issue due to its one-child policy, which must be factored into demand models, particularly when looking at per capita consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:09">[01:07:09]</a>. While demographic shifts could lead to inflation by shifting manufacturing away from China, their direct impact on specific commodity trades is not a primary driver for investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

### The "Carry Trade" and Real Assets
The concept of the "carry trade," where assets are bought with borrowed low-interest funds, has become pervasive, particularly within the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. However, commodity markets and real assets appear to be on the other side of this trade, serving almost as a funding mechanism (a "short") that helps propel the long side of the carry trade bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. An unwind of this carry trade could initiate a rethinking of global monetary systems and serve as a catalyst for a bottom in real assets relative to financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.

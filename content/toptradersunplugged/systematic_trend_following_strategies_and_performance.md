Top Traders Unplugged Systematic Investor monitors the pulse of markets from the perspective of a real-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It's important to remember that all discussions about investment performance pertain to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or even infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. There is also a significant risk of financial loss with all investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Recent Performance of [[trend_following_strategies | Trend Following Strategies]]

As of the middle of the week (Wednesday of the recording), [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] in the CTA world have shown positive performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

*   The "Trend" index was up 1.45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   The Sub-chain CT index was up 1.35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

This indicates a positive month for CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Year-to-Date Performance

The positive monthly performance has contributed to reasonably positive year-to-date figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>:

*   The CTA index is up 2.7% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   The Trend index is up 2.75% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

This overall performance for [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following investment strategies]] and managed futures has been supported by a rally in equities, gains in bonds, weakness in the dollar, and a downward movement in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

> [!info] Note

The broader context of market flows and structural economic forces are highlighted as significant drivers of performance.

## Market Dynamics Influencing [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | Systematic Investing and Trend Following]]

Several factors are noted to be influencing market performance and potentially [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic and trendfollowing investment approaches]]:

*   **Volatility Compression**: Following a decent-sized rally, volatility compression often becomes overdone, particularly in long-dated calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical and Election Landscape**: Current volatility is priced low despite geopolitical factors and an upcoming election, suggesting that call prices are dramatically cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Structural Effects and Flows**: Significant structural effects are expected to push markets higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These include:
    *   **Year-end Rebalancing**: If the market is up significantly (e.g., 20% in a year), the increase in asset values (acting as collateral) leads to substantial "new money" that needs to be reinvested by institutions and asset managers to maintain a risk-neutral investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For instance, 10% of a $50 trillion increase could be reinvested on January 1st, which is an order of magnitude larger than average daily market volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This rebalancing effect is a core reason for the historically strong performance from mid-December to mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
    *   **Low Volume during Holidays**: The period from Thanksgiving to early January sees dramatically lower trading volume due to numerous holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This low volume amplifies "charm and vanna flows," leading to quicker risk removal and significant buybacks of tail risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
    *   **Major Structured Product Expirations**: December and January are periods for the biggest expirations of structured products and options, which further influences market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
    *   **Election Impact**: The upcoming November 8th election creates fear of contested outcomes, leading to high skew (downside versus upside pricing) in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Dealers short puts at high prices, leading to a "tidal wave" of positive flows as time accelerates and volume is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This effect drives positive flows regardless of who is elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

> [!warning] Long-term Outlook
> While short-term flows into January are incredibly bullish, the longer-term outlook for markets post-New Year is considered dangerous. The current setup could lead to a "blow-off top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a>. Historically, populist periods with contested elections lead to significant stimulus, boosting markets in the short term, but often result in poor long-term economic outcomes due to structural inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Geopolitical Influences

The performance of [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | trend following and momentum strategies]] is also set against a backdrop of macro trends:

*   **China's Stimulus**: China's "big bazooka" stimulus measures, unveiled around the time of the discussion, are seen as strategically timed to coincide with a period of broad market positivity and positive flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This is expected to be very positive for Chinese assets and provide an added benefit to broad markets, diminishing downside risk and helping to drive positive flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
    *   However, long-term concerns about China persist, particularly regarding rule of law and the willingness of investors to commit capital if trust is eroded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. There is a perceived bifurcation between China and the West, especially the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Inflation and the Fed**: The Federal Reserve's stance and the outlook for rates are critical. While recent data shows declining headline PCE and core PCE month-over-month below expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>, the underlying structural inflation is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
    *   **Structural Inflation**: For about four years, the economy has been in a structurally inflationary period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. Unlike cyclical inflation driven by the business cycle, structural inflation is driven by shifts like:
        *   The end of a deflationary period (roughly 40 years until 2020) where monetary policy primarily benefited the top of the distribution through asset markets, leading to globalization and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
        *   A shift towards policies driven by populism and a desire for median outcomes, leading to fiscal spending, wealth redistribution, de-globalization, and global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   **Yield Curve Steepener**: The steepening of the yield curve is counter-intuitive if heading into recession but makes sense in a structurally inflationary environment where short-term cyclical deflationary pressures are removed, allowing structural inflationary pressures to reignite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This implies a future of "stagflation" where the Fed may be forced to deal with sustained demand-push dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.
*   **Election Impact on Policy**: The US presidential election is expected to significantly impact structural inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
    *   **Trump Administration**: Likely to be more supply-side fiscally, but also very stimulative. Would put pressure on the Fed to stimulate on his behalf, leading to a massive cyclical positive for markets in the short term, but a worse structural secular inflationary pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. An isolationist stance could accelerate global conflicts (e.g., China-Taiwan), though potentially leading to a quicker resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. There's also a higher chance of a deal with Saudi Arabia, potentially easing inflationary pressures from commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. Most significantly, a hardline immigration policy could dramatically increase labor inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>. A Trump win is also likely to result in Republican control of both houses, enabling significant policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
    *   **Harris Administration**: Policies like taxing capital gains and wealth redistribution are also inflationary, though perhaps more measured than a Trump approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. A Harris presidency might lead to a longer, bigger global conflict if China's actions are delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Post-Election Market Dynamics**: Regardless of the outcome, the immediate two-to-four-week period post-election is expected to see structural positive flows due to high skew unwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>. However, beyond January, this "sugar high" is likely to end, potentially leading to retracement and decline, especially as geopolitical holding patterns resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. History shows populist election years are strong for markets, but the subsequent decade or 15 years can be very poor due to rising secular inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

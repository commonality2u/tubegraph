## The Limitations of Traditional Portfolios
The common 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) largely assumes a future of peace and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While this assumption held true in the past, it may not be the norm for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Holding such a portfolio represents a significant bet on these specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. The problem with the 60/40 stock-bond mix is that it is 95% driven by the stock market due to the relative volatilities of the two asset types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

Most investors are not well-prepared for an environment different from the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. This contrasts sharply with periods like 1968 to 1982, where equities saw a 65% decline in real terms over 14 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. The idea that "stocks for the long run" and buy-and-hold strategies always work for long periods is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>.

## Shifting Economic Paradigms
The global macro framework is currently experiencing an income-driven expansion, which differs significantly from the credit-led expansions of the last 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While rising interest rates are slowing credit creation, they are not a large enough drag to overcome consistent income and spending growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This dynamic, where wages and salaries grow and nominal spending keeps pace with a flat savings rate, can persist for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Unlike credit booms, which lead to unsustainable debt, income dominance can continue without problematic build-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Many core structural dynamics that drove disinflationary pressures before COVID-19, such as global integration and the movement of a billion people from farms to factories, are mostly gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. An unusual period of global peace, where loss of life in conflicts was at thousand-year lows before the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is also unlikely to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. War is inherently inflationary due to material destruction and a pullback of globalization and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Furthermore, household and business balance sheets are generally in much better shape than 15 years ago, resolving deleveraging dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This confluence of deglobalization, increased conflict, and resolved deleveraging points to structurally higher inflation ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

Demographic factors also play a role, as workers are being pulled out of the economy (retiring) while still spending, creating an inflationary pressure primarily through keeping labor markets tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. The younger generation, such as Millennials, are gaining political dominance and seeking different outcomes, including labor rights and protectionism, which are connected to fiscal spending and deglobalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.

## The Case for Alternative Investments

### Diversification and Risk Management
A critical aspect of portfolio construction is to create a [[Diversification and risk management in investment portfolios | diversified portfolio]] that protects against outcomes like reduced globalization and increased global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This is not about projecting future events, but recognizing the humility in not knowing what will happen and being prepared for a multitude of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The real risk for most investors is not simply asset depreciation, but rather inflation rising relative to assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>. The goal is to protect and compound purchasing power or real wealth over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. This means naturally tilting towards assets that perform well in inflation, such as TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), [[Gold and Commodities | gold]], and [[Gold and Commodities | commodities]], rather than assets that do not, like bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. The current investment landscape, with its emphasis on bonds and lack of inflationary assets, is counterproductive to building a long-term real wealth portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

### Strategic Asset Classes
[[Building a diversified investment portfolio | Building a diversified portfolio]] that can handle a wide range of circumstances is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. In a future with weaker growth and higher inflation, the traditional 60/40 portfolio is unlikely to be the best performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Diversification is needed to protect against the possibility of higher for longer and more persistent inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

Assets that nobody seems to hold in their portfolios, but are critically important diversifiers for a period of higher inflation, include [[Gold and Commodities | gold]] and [[Gold and Commodities | commodities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. For commodities, it is advisable to invest in a diversified, balanced portfolio, such as a CRB (Commodity Research Bureau) type index, rather than being overweight in a single commodity like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. This ensures preparation for various outcomes and specific commodity squeezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>.

## Strategic Portfolio Construction
[[Diversification and portfolio management | Diversification]] in investment strategies means moving away from simply investing in diversified equities within the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. It requires [[Diversification in investment strategies | diversification]] in strategy, away from beta, including hedge funds and other non-correlated alternatives like event-driven or arbitrage strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

A "simple game plan" for a long-term savings portfolio, a "set it and forget it" approach, begins with beta, meaning holding risky assets (not cash) for their expected long-term appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. This beta portfolio should be broadly [[Portfolio Diversification and Risk Management | diversified]], for example, by holding equal risk weight between stocks, bonds, gold, and diversified commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.

Beyond this diversified beta, it is crucial to tilt the portfolio towards inflation protection assets like TIPS, [[Gold and Commodities | gold]], and [[Gold and Commodities | commodities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. Additionally, adding diversified Alpha, such as through trend following strategies, is highly effective, with about 10-15% allocation providing significant benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>. This combination of [[Diversification and risk management in investment portfolios | diversified beta]] tilted towards inflation protection, with approximately 20% allocated to diversified Alpha strategies, forms a robust overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

## Accessibility of Alternatives
A core challenge in the alternatives space is the tradeoff between the Alpha generated and the fees and taxes paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>. Traditional LP (Limited Partnership) positions in 2-and-20 style funds often result in very low net returns for the investor after fees, taxes, and advisory costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.

Many institutional investors allocate a substantial portion (around 50%) of their portfolios to alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. These sophisticated managers invest in dozens of funds across various strategies and use their capital to negotiate lower fees, often paying closer to 100 basis points on average, rather than 400-500 basis points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. They essentially create low-cost index funds of Alpha strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>.

The advent of ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) for alternatives offers a solution to make these strategies more accessible and affordable for everyday investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. ETFs are typically much lower in fees and significantly more tax-efficient than traditional LP structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. This allows more Alpha to remain with the investor, aligning with the goal of maximizing net-of-fee, net-of-tax Alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. The accessibility of ETFs means that whether one invests $20 or $20 million, the access is the same, which is crucial for enabling a broader range of people to build better long-term savings portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.

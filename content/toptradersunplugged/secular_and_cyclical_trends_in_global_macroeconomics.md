In a discussion on [[global_macroeconomic_trends | global macroeconomic trends]] in Q2 2023, co-host Jim Kasang elaborated on his macro view, highlighting the interplay between [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular and cyclical market trends]] and their influence on financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He noted that while some things remain the same, others are changing, particularly due to a generational populist push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Generational Populist Push: A Secular Trend

Kasang emphasizes that underpinning current [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | market trends and macroeconomic factors]] is a generational populist push, which has been building for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This movement stems from four decades of monetary policy that has created historic inequality, though it was optimal for maximizing GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The ability to lower interest rates from 20% in 1982 to near zero, combined with a Fiat-driven world and the U.S. dollar's reserve currency status, allowed for an "unlimited" amount of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

However, this policy had a cost: underlying inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. There is a limit to how far inequality will be allowed to go, and that bound has been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This isn't just about stratification but also generational divides, as the younger generation, having experienced this for 40 years, is now growing into political dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Their beliefs about unfairness and unjust stratification are coming to the forefront globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

This populist push will continue to drive rebalancing efforts, particularly during political intervals like elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This can manifest as:
*   More progressive taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   Increased fiscal policy and money flowing to the bottom via payments or credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Protectionism and nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

These are considered [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular trends]] that will fundamentally alter the economic landscape for the next 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Cyclical Realities within Secular Trends

While [[global_macroeconomic_trends | secular trends]] provide the overarching framework, cyclical realities continue to play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The Federal Reserve and other central bankers react to these movements, and reflexive positioning drives counter-cyclical moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Citing the 1968-1982 period, Kasang notes that even during major [[global_macroeconomic_cycles_and_their_influence_on_financial_markets | cyclical downturns]] with recessions and pullbacks in inflation and Federal Reserve funds rates, the bigger picture secular trend remained unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In fact, these downturns often drive more fiscal policy and reinforce the [[global_macroeconomic_trends | secular trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Getting the [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular trend]] right can lead to significant wealth over 10-15 years, similar to how taking advantage of growth over value or equity/bond leverage over the last 40 years led to wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Cyclical downturns are seen as opportunities within this larger framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## The Federal Reserve's Influence on Volatility

The Federal Reserve influences the current volatility (Vol) environment through its actions, likened to "selling puts and selling calls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Selling Puts:** The Fed provides liquidity (e.g., securing depositors) to backstop tail risks in the market, preventing liquidation events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This lowers volatility and can create short-term market bounces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Selling Calls:** Simultaneously, the Fed removes liquidity by increasing interest rates and talking down the market to curb the wealth effect and stimulate the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The Fed's core function is to reduce volatility and smooth the business cycle, dampening it from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. They are trying to bring the market down without triggering a liquidation event, which is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This creates a "Push-Pull" dynamic where one force (long-duration interest rate increases) is more powerful in the long run, while short-term stimuli provide a "sugar QE" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Lagging Effects of Policy

Federal Reserve actions have significant lagging effects on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates:** Increases in interest rates (e.g., 5% from zero) move very slowly through the economy, particularly on the majority of assets like commercial real estate, venture capital, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Even corporate buybacks, a core demand driver in the equity market, operate with a massive lag, taking about a year to show effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Housing starts also demonstrate this lag, with current increases reflecting projects initiated a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The average lag for interest rates is estimated to be around 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Stimulus:** The U.S. has undertaken almost $10 trillion in fiscal stimulus, which is also gradually working its way into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Stimulus:** Immediate pushes in demand come from securing depositors and the Treasury General Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.
*   **Wealth Effect & Positioning:** The wealth effect from a higher market and short positioning by hedge funds ahead of anticipated downturns also contribute to complex dynamics, often leading to counter-intuitive short-term rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

This creates a scenario where a large, slow-moving "tidal wave" of interest rate effects is approaching, while immediate liquidity injections and short-term positioning lead to market rallies, potentially resulting in a "blow-off top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Demographics and Inflation

[[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | Demographics]] are considered a core [[global_macroeconomic_trends | secular force]] that operates on a time scale of decades, not quarters or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
*   **Generational Shift:** The younger generation (Millennials), being the labor class, will become the primary voting class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Millennials represent a population bubble, similar to Baby Boomers, but are currently at only 40% of the wealth creation and household formation levels of Baby Boomers at the same age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. This creates a "potential energy" and a powerful feeling of needing to "catch up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.
*   **Labor Market Impact:** As Baby Boomers retire or die, there is a dramatic reduction in the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This, combined with the new voting bloc's demand for rebalancing inequality, drives policies like more protectionism and onshoring, which create more demand for labor domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Inflationary Force:** The shift to prioritizing median outcomes over maximizing GDP or total output dramatically changes the relationship between inflation and maximum employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Jim suggests that the Phillips curve (relationship between unemployment and inflation) will become central again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. High employment rates, like Denmark's record employment despite interest rate hikes, indicate this underlying strength in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. This makes demographics a major driver of sticky [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

## The Future of Inflation: Stagflation Risk

Kasang dismisses the "recession or no recession" debate as overly simplistic, viewing it as a two-dimensional perspective from the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. He argues that the market is now multi-dimensional, with the [[global_macroeconomic_trends | secular force]] being dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

Instead of a deep recession, the worst-case scenario for markets is "stagflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. This involves:
*   **Strong Demand:** Demand remains quite strong, keeping GDP resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>.
*   **Earnings Recession:** Margins compress from record levels due to higher interest rates, labor costs, and deglobalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This leads to an earnings recession where earnings and multiples get "smashed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Sticky Inflation:** Strong demand and compressing margins keep inflation sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

This environment is reminiscent of the 1960s and 1970s (1968-1982), where there was above-trend real GDP growth with high inflation, yet markets went nowhere in nominal terms and lost significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. This "weak market, relatively strong economy" scenario is the "worst of both worlds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. A light recession or stagflation in an election cycle would likely give a green light for more fiscal stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>.

### Other Inflationary Sources

Beyond labor costs, several other factors contribute to sticky CPI:
*   **Commodity Strength:** The Fed's activism against inflation was occurring when oil was in the low $60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. The OPEC put (production cuts) and resource scarcity will continue to be a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.
*   **China's Reopening:** The reopening of China's economy is leading to significant international demand support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>.
*   **Weakening Dollar:** The dollar's dramatic weakening, which previously helped the U.S. export inflation, is now working the other way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Wealth Effect:** Markets are near short-term highs, and speculative assets like Bitcoin have seen significant gains, making the Fed nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

These factors combined are likely to keep CPI sticky in the short to medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

## Investment Implications and the "Pain Trade"

For the last 40 years, markets have been largely controlled by the Fed's ability to stimulate and reinflate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. However, the emergence of inflation and fiscal stimulus as a "countervailing force" puts the Fed in a box, leading to a less controlled, more multi-dimensional environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. This is happening at a time when potential energy and liquidity are at record levels, and valuations are at extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

While everyone talks about a recession leading to lower interest rates, Jim questions whether interest rates will actually fall significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. He suggests that a light recession or stagflation will create an opportunity for a significant [[opportunities_and_risks_in_global_macroeconomic_environments | secular second-move trade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. The 1968-1982 period saw initial inflationary trades, but the "best trade" was the second move after a slight deflationary pullback, when markets lost trust in the Fed and the bond market began raising long-term inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

### Shifting Focus Beyond Equities

Jim suggests that the next 10-15 years, particularly the next five years during this "turn," will be dominated by [[global_macroeconomic_influences_on_trading_strategies | macro]] factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. He believes that the coming period will be less about equities and more about:
*   Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
*   Currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:15">[00:51:15]</a>.
*   Precious metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

He anticipates significant "tail realities" and "leptokurtic moves" (extreme, unexpected shifts) across asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.

### Volatility and the "Unpinning"

While broad market equity volatility (VIX) has been low, significant internal moves have occurred between growth and value, and within the internal structure of equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. Equity volatility can act as a "plug" that pins the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. The "unpinning" of this volatility can happen in unexpected ways, often to the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>. This means a sudden explosion of realized volatility, which isn't necessarily to the downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

When implied volatility on calls is low, dealers are long volatility, and if the market keeps squeezing higher, it can lead to a point where the "Vol Supply" gets unpinned, meaning dealers are no longer long volatility and the street gets shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. This can cause overall volatility to go higher and "unpins the market," releasing the controlling effect of implied volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. Such an "upside squeeze" can be a very fast reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. This process marks the transition where typical negative correlation between VIX and S&P 500 can become positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.

## Outlook

The current situation is characterized by a mismatch between [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular realities]] (which suggest a challenging environment for traditional assets) and market positioning (which is not yet aligned with these realities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. The "pain trade" is ongoing, aiming to force market participants to capitulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>.

An opportunity exists given the low volatility, particularly to the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. The market is entering an "interesting couple of months," with storm clouds brewing and the lag from past actions working through the system, as demand is pulled off the table from factors like buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>. This period suggests that the market may not follow the traditional "sell in May and go away" pattern, but rather a later downturn in June or July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

Man Group, a large alternative manager, broadly splits its numerous funds and strategies into two main categories: [[systematic_vs_discretionary_trading | systematic and discretionary]] approaches [02:59:00]. While the firm offers both, its AHL division operates on a 100% [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic]] basis [03:08:00], primarily focusing on active trading [03:36:00].

## Philosophy of [[philosophies_of_systematic_trading | Systematic Trading]]

The core belief within AHL is that small opportunities and inefficiencies exist across various markets [04:57:00]. To capture these, it is essential to efficiently move positions and trade sensibly, as trading can otherwise be a drag on performance [05:07:00]. A pragmatic approach is taken to identify where these opportunities exist and, crucially, when they cease to exist [05:23:00].

A significant part of the research process in the [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic space]] is dedicated to understanding the drivers of returns and identifying market inefficiencies [05:42:00]. Once found, the goal is to exploit them as efficiently and diversely as possible across many different regions and markets [05:52:00]. Combining efficient [[systematic_trading_systems | trading systems]] with broad diversification allows small edges to be transformed into significant returns [06:05:00].

### Evolution of Models

According to Russell Koganka, Chief Investment Officer at Man AHL, it is easy to replicate past performance, but quite difficult to replicate sophisticated strategies going forward [00:32:00]. Models that have been refined with new features and improved execution profiles are more likely to work going forward than basic models from 20 years ago [00:21:00]. While basic [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] systems might perform well in specific environments (e.g., slow trend followers in 2022) [32:51:00], continuous research and improvement are vital for long-term success across different market conditions [33:07:00].

## Key Elements of [[systematic_trading_strategies | Systematic Trading Strategies]]

### Diversification Across Markets and Models
Adding genuinely diversifying markets and different models makes a significant difference to performance [32:30:00]. While minor tweaks to a [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] system, such as adjusting speeds or market weights, may not drastically alter results, broadening the scope to include new, uncorrelated markets and distinct models enhances overall returns [32:17:00].

### Dynamic Position Sizing
[[Systematic_macro_trading_approach | Systematic approaches]] often utilize dynamic position sizing to control risk [40:20:00]. This is based on the understanding that while returns are difficult to predict, risk in markets is much easier to predict and is highly time-varying [40:24:00]. Dynamic scaling allows the system to control risk and remain active in stressful markets, which are often conducive to positive returns for [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] [43:52:00]. This contrasts with relying solely on stop-loss systems, which might lead to being knocked out of the market during swings, losing exposure during potentially profitable periods [43:57:00].

### Execution Efficiency
Good execution is critical as it allows for the harvesting of a richer set of alphas [36:31:00]. For basic, slow [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] systems, execution quality might not be paramount [36:46:00]. However, for more complex systems that introduce various types of alphas or adapt trade profiles of slower systems, highly efficient execution enables the exploitation of more alpha at a larger scale without altering the overall risk properties [37:03:00].

## Challenges and Considerations

### Replication
Replicating past performance of strategies is relatively easy, but replicating sophisticated strategies successfully into the future is challenging [00:32:00]. Models built to explain past returns, even those based on indices of [[rulebased trading strategies | trend followers]], may not have conviction for future performance [28:11:00]. True success in replication would require replicating positions, ideally ahead of time, and trading them very efficiently, which is often overlooked [28:38:00].

### Market Evolution and Strategy Adaptation
Market efficiency has increased over time, leading to less "information leakage" [34:41:00]. This has impacted short-term [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] more than long-term, as the inefficiency that drove it has diminished [34:58:00]. While adapting strategies to these changes is crucial, it requires good analytics, data, and intuition to understand *why* changes are occurring [39:09:00].

### Crisis Alpha and Portfolio Fit
[[Systematic and trendfollowing investment approaches | Trend following]] naturally offers "crisis alpha" â€” the tendency to perform well when the broader market does badly [14:07:00]. This is because market panics typically unfold over weeks and months, creating suitable environments for trends [15:19:00]. While not the original intention of these strategies, it has become a valued feature by institutional investors who seek genuinely diversifying strategies beyond low average correlation [14:39:00]. Incorporating [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] into a portfolio can significantly improve its tail properties without detracting from expected returns [54:50:00].

### Capacity and Fees
Most [[systematic_trading_strategies | strategies]] have a capacity limit, which is influenced by factors like market liquidity and the speed at which positions can be exited [50:21:00]. While highly liquid markets offer huge capacity for strategies like [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]], pricing ultimately aligns with supply and demand. Products with limited supply or superior properties tend to command higher fees [51:08:00].

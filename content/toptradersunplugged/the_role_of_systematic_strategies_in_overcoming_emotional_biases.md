The field of investing often presents challenges that human psychology is not inherently equipped to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. While the human brain has evolved to solve problems that existed on the African Savannah, these evolutionary adaptations are not optimal for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>, leading to suboptimal decisions, especially for discretionary traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

## How Human Psychology Impacts Investing Decisions

Roy Neerhofer's early interest in neuroscience, particularly how the human brain works, deeply influenced his approach to trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:10">[08:08:10]</a>. A key insight from neuroscience is that the brain's structure significantly influences human behavior, meaning individuals are products of their "hardware" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This "hardware" is designed to keep individuals alive, free of predators, and able to reproduce and find food, not to keep them profitable in trading markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

Several [[Cognitive biases in trading decisions | cognitive biases]] stem from these evolutionary patterns and can derail investors:

*   **Risk Aversion** People inherently hate to lose more than they love to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This aversion, beneficial for survival against predators, can lead to strategies that appear appealing but are not optimal for a comprehensive investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.
*   **Endowment Bias** This [[Cognitive biases in trading decisions | cognitive bias]] suggests that something you own is typically valued more highly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   **Consensus Bias** Humans tend to "stampede with the herd," making it emotionally very difficult to be a contrarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>.
*   **Recency Bias** Recent information is remembered more vividly than past information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. While the current environment might predict what happens next in nature, this is not true in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition Bias** The brain is wired to see visual patterns, even when they aren't statistically significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. This makes charting unhelpful, as it leads to decisions not based on probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>.

Essentially, human beings, as normal individuals, are "terrible investors" if they follow their instincts, as these instincts are not optimized for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

## Systematic Strategies as a Solution

[[Systematic trading strategies | Systematic strategies]] are often presented as a way to avoid [[Cognitive biases in trading and investing | cognitive biases]] and the suboptimal emotional responses that can lead to selling at the worst possible time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. A computer's "stomach doesn't hurt," implying an immunity to emotional decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>.

However, the challenge lies in the fact that people tend to carry these same [[Behavioral biases and investment strategies | behavioral biases]] when they create and utilize [[Systematic investing strategies | systematic strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00">[16:58:00]</a>.

Examples of biases affecting systematic strategies:

*   **Over-reliance on Recent Performance** Investors, and even creators of quantitative strategies, tend to overuse recent performance when deciding whether to employ or continue using a [[Systematic investing strategies | systematic strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. For instance, the Sharp Ratio over the last two years is often the most common evaluative tool for CTAs, yet it is completely un-predictive of future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>.
*   **Loss Aversion in Strategy Design** The tendency for people to hate losing more than winning influences the incentives to use certain strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Prop traders, for example, often face tight loss limits, which discourages strategies that might lose money for several months before a large profit, leading to a short-volatility approach across firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:12:00">[18:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. This collective aversion to losses can lead to a significant short volatility vulnerability within the firm itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>, which may explain why many multi-strategy funds lose significantly during periods of illiquidity and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:59:00">[18:59:00]</a>.

## Roy Neerhofer Capital Management's Approach

Roy Neerhofer's firm, RG Neerhofer Capital Management, has been designed from its inception to address these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Their strategy is tuned not to maximize their own Sharp Ratio or risk-adjusted return, but rather to maximize the risk-adjusted return of their clients' portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

Their approach includes:

*   **Maintaining Negative Correlation** The firm aims to maintain a consistent negative correlation to equities and other traditional investments, providing downside protection during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This is critical because when most portfolios are struggling, their strategy performs better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Their weekly correlation to the stock market has been negative every year for the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50:00">[47:50:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Trend Following** They deliberately avoid trend following strategies, distinguishing themselves in the CTA space by focusing on capturing realized volatility in the short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
*   **Scientific Approach** They emphasize a scientific approach to data, avoiding belief in things simply because they are conventional wisdom or articles of faith (like Elliot wave theory) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:00">[22:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>. This means requiring testable and falsifiable hypotheses for all strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.
*   **Contrarian Thinking** The firm prioritizes not following the status quo or popular trades, aiming to provide liquidity to the majority and starting with a strategy that has a positive expected return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:00">[24:02:00]</a>. This [[Philosophies of systematic trading | contrarian philosophy]] extends to hiring individuals who are creative, out-of-the-box thinkers, and willing to challenge existing paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Collaboration** Their culture fosters an open environment where everyone sees real-time P&L and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:59">[01:10:59]</a>. Researchers, IT, and traders work together on the same floor, encouraging mutual education, confidence to ask questions, and constructive criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>.

By systematically implementing strategies that are designed to avoid inherent [[Cognitive biases in trading and investing | cognitive biases]] and that focus on portfolio-level benefits, firms like RG Neerhofer Capital Management aim to provide consistent, protective returns that truly enhance a client's overall investment profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. They believe that focusing on factors like correlation and performance during "shock events" is more predictive of future utility than merely looking at past returns or standalone Sharp Ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. This holistic approach helps mitigate the impact of human [[Managing emotional responses in trading | emotional responses]] and biases on investment decisions.

The concept of "pure trend" in investment strategies primarily refers to a system that exclusively follows price movements and uses these market movements as the sole basis for position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This approach is distinct from [[Trend Following Strategies | trend following]] strategies that might incorporate other factors.

## Core Characteristics

A pure trend strategy embodies a "divergent" risk-taking approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Key characteristics include:
*   **Conviction-linked position sizing**: As a trend measures higher, the position in that asset increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.
*   **Reliance on price movements**: The pure basis for position sizing is strictly market movements and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.
*   **Absence of external beliefs**: It avoids adding "convergent beliefs" or assumptions, such as a "carry signal" or other strategies, into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This ensures the strategy remains agnostic to external views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.
*   **Systematic loss cutting and trend following**: A pure trend strategy systematically cuts losses when things aren't moving in the trend's direction and continues to follow trends as they increase, regardless of any specific belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Pure Trend vs. Other Strategies

The distinction between "momentum" and [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] is often discussed. Historically, academic literature linked "momentum" with cross-sectional momentum, which involves buying winners and selling losers based on relative outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. [[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]], or time series momentum, on the other hand, focuses on persistence in an asset's own time series—an object in motion continuing in motion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

A "purely divergent strategy" is essentially a pure trend strategy that does not incorporate "views based" assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. The philosophy is that the world is non-deterministic and random, making it difficult to predict what will happen next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. A pure trend strategy accepts the "unknowable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### Impact of Risk Management
While a pure trend follower aims not to "contaminate" their signal, the risk management process can sometimes introduce convergent behaviors that unravel pure trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

An example of a risk management approach that could introduce convergent behavior is **constant risk targeting**. If a strategy targets a specific volatility (e.g., 10% VaR), it might "dial down" positions when signals are high and "dial up" when signals are low. This effectively introduces a convergent, "mean-reverting" approach to the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. While this might perform similarly over long horizons, their profiles diverge significantly during extreme environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

However, having a "consistent risk posture" or "guardrails" on position sizing for portfolio diversification, rather than aggressively adjusting risk, is different. This doesn't necessarily introduce convergence but allows for prudent management without hindering the ability to capture large outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Importance and Performance

Pure trend strategies are particularly important during crisis periods because they are historically the best at reacting to difficult, changing, and unpredictable market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. They do not predict these changes but react in their wake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

For instance, in 2022 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, pure [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following]] was one of the few strategies that performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. This was due to its ability to follow strong trends, such as short energy positions and long bond positions, which moved drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

In environments where convergent views are challenged, pure trend strategies typically act as the first line of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. They thrive when the world is "divergent"—meaning things change in unexpected and unwanted ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Conversely, they may experience more false starts and losses when the market is "convergent" and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

This consistency in adhering to a divergent approach makes a strategy "pure trend," enabling it to react effectively during periods of dislocation, whether from equity crises, bond crises, geopolitical crises, or inflation crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.

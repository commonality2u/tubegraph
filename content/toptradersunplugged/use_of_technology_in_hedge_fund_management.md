Dunn Capital Management, one of the oldest and most successful systematic managers globally, has at its core the application of technology to portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The firm's enduring success over four decades highlights the robustness of its approach in an industry that has undergone significant changes that could not have been imagined in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Early Days: Punch Cards and Mainframes

Bill Dunn, the founder, realized early on that there had to be a better way to make a living than working for the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He envisioned using mathematical or statistical data derived from market prices to determine optimal buy and sell points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. His entire philosophy was based on the objective nature of price data, with no subjective knowledge involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

In the 1970s, when personal computers and today's computing power were non-existent, the challenge was immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Bill initially looked at equities, but quickly realized the sheer volume of data made it impractical to process and act upon within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. He then turned to futures, as only about a dozen commodity contracts were traded at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

To execute his strategy, Bill and his son Daniel would manually punch data onto computer punch cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. These cards were then taken to a library or rented mainframe time to be run, generating the prices for the next day's trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Dunn Capital still keeps a set of these punch cards from the mid-1970s as a nostalgic reminder of their origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Evolution and Modernization

The firm's research philosophy is built on the understanding that no "holy grail" of trading exists, but continuous improvement is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. As technology advanced, it provided Dunn Capital with the necessary tools and speed to implement strategies that were impossible in earlier decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

Key technological upgrades and their impact include:

*   **2006 System Overhaul**
    Dunn Capital, acknowledging a period of stagnation, undertook its most significant system change in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Previously, each market was analyzed individually, and models were designed on a market-by-market basis before assembling the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
    The new approach shifted focus to the *portfolio as a whole*, designing models that applied across the entire portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This made the systems significantly more robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
    Before 2006, the firm ran three models per market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. After the changes, they traded upwards of 100 different models, combining them to determine a "strength" (plus one or negative one) for each market, and executed trades on the open of each day based on prior day's activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. This expansion allowed the system to look at hundreds of time frames and noise variables, enabling migration between shorter and longer term trends, making the system more adaptive and flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. The expansion also extended to commodities within the WMA program, as electronic markets and sufficient volume were not available before 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

*   **2008 Dynamic Risk Implementation**
    In 2008, a dynamic risk system was implemented, allowing daily adjustment of risk rather than relying solely on historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

*   **2011 Algo Class Expansion**
    The firm introduced a second "algo class" to its trading system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
    *   **Original Algo**: Always in the market, either long or short (full reversal program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
    *   **Second Algo**: Can be long, short, or flat, and includes a stop-loss like function (though not price-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.
    These two algo types, while having some correlation, provide better overall performance than either one alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. The algorithms rely purely on daily high, low, and close price data, not intraday feeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

*   **2013 Adaptive Risk Profile (ARP)**
    A significant improvement in early 2013 introduced an adaptive risk profile (ARP), which adjusts the Value at Risk (VAR) target daily based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. This proprietary measure gauges the "trendiness" of markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
    The better the environment for [[trend_following | trend following]], the higher the VAR target; conversely, the lower the market's trendiness, the lower the VAR target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. This allows for reduced volatility and drawdowns without sacrificing upside profitability, which is often an outcome when volatility is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. The ARP system considers individual market trends, correlations between markets, and market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

## Operational Structure and Technology

Dunn Capital handles all operations in-house, including administration, accounting, statement preparation, and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This is partly due to the firm's culture and partly because they haven't found outside providers that meet their high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This internal approach allows for more timely service, direct investor interaction, and significantly lower costs as no pass-through fees are charged for these services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

The firm's focus on technology and systematic strategies is reflected in their daily position adjustments. At the end of each day, the desired position is determined based on market data, and positions are adjusted accordingly, with a small threshold to avoid excessive trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

When evaluating [[evaluating_hedge_fund_performance | hedge fund performance]], the firm's research changes since 2006 have been consistently validated by their performance, particularly noted in 2011, which set them apart from peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. This highlights the effectiveness of their technology-driven research and development. While the [[challenges_and_considerations_in_hedge_fund_management | hedge fund management challenges]] of the last four years have been tough for [[advancements_and_limitations_in_cta_and_hedge_fund_replication | trend following]], Dunn Capital has maintained a lower correlation to other trend followers, while remaining 100% trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. Marty Bergen is convinced that the firm's superior performance stems from its robust [[understanding_and_managing_investment_risks_in_hedge_funds_and_ctas | risk management]] and portfolio development, rather than the core algorithms themselves, which he believes are not vastly different from those used by others in [[replication_strategies_for_hedge_funds | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

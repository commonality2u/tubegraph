Understanding and valuing treasuries is a complex subject, with various perspectives on their intrinsic worth and market behavior. Alex Gorodaevich, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Haunted Investments, shares his insights and experiences on this topic, drawing from his background as a macro trader and market maker in fixed income derivatives.

## Traditional vs. Modern Valuation

Traditionally, bonds, including U.S. Treasuries, have often been viewed through a "hold to maturity" mentality, where their value is assessed based on their yield [00:11:56]. Critics might argue that treasuries yielding only two or three percent are "hideously overvalued" compared to the stock market's potential average returns [00:07:37]. This perspective often focuses on outright yields or concepts like the [[interest_rates_and_their_effect_on_asset_valuations|term premium]] [00:07:41]. However, Gorodaevich dismisses the concept of term premium as "smoke and mirrors," arguing it adds "absolutely zero value to the discussion" of valuation [00:09:00].

Instead, he posits two fundamental ways to consider any asset's value:
1.  **Supply and Demand:** Assets go up when there are more buyers than sellers, and down when there are more sellers than buyers [00:10:07]. If demand for treasuries overcomes supply at current levels, their price will rise [00:10:25].
2.  **Cash Flows:** Valuing an asset based on the actual cash flows it is expected to generate [00:10:36].

## The "Theory of Relativity" in Finance: Risk Parity

A significant shift in understanding bond valuation, which Gorodaevich considers as important as the theory of relativity for physics, is the concept of [[risk_parity_and_finance|risk parity]] [00:12:15]. This approach fundamentally changes how bonds are viewed in a portfolio [00:12:29]:
*   **Portfolio Enhancement:** Bonds are not merely a displacement for stocks but an enhancement [00:12:29]. Instead of selling stocks to buy bonds, investors can use stocks as collateral to own bond futures, creating a portfolio that is both safer and potentially more profitable [00:12:38].
*   **Diversification and Correlation:** This strategy gains benefit from the negative correlation between stocks and bonds, particularly on a large scale, despite not always working daily [00:13:49]. This dramatically improves portfolio performance [00:13:05].

## Treasuries as Cash and Collateral

Beyond traditional investment, treasuries serve a crucial role as liquid, risk-free collateral [00:14:29]. They are treated as cash, offering a yield where regular cash might yield nothing [00:14:40].

The post-2008 emphasis on collateralized lending has further increased the importance of bonds as something to hold [00:16:38]. The global debt market, of which treasuries are a small fraction, is growing rapidly, leading to an increasing demand for safe collateral [00:17:11]. Even with increasing [[bond_market_trends_and_treasury_issuance|U.S. Treasury issuance]], this global demand for collateral might not be fully met [00:17:54]. The demand for dollars in cross-border settlements also increases the need for interest-bearing dollar assets like treasuries [00:18:03].

### Misconceptions about Duration Risk

A common misconception is that when 30-year bond yields are low (e.g., three or two percent), all the risk is against the investor, as yields cannot go much lower [00:15:08]. However, as demonstrated by examples like Austrian government bonds that rallied significantly even from negative yields, this is not the case [00:15:15]. Due to convexity, if a 30-year bond's yield falls from three percent to zero, its price can increase substantially (e.g., from 100 to 119) [00:15:43]. When yields are low, the DV01 (dollar value of a one-basis-point change in yield) is particularly high, meaning small drops in yield can yield greater benefits [00:15:53].

For a 30-year bond at three percent yield, the risk-reward is considered symmetric, even if one factors in the possibility of a complete default [00:16:12].

## Trading and Portfolio Management in Crisis

Gorodaevich emphasizes that even during periods of high stress, such as March 2020, when many trades might be unprofitable or closed quickly, the aggregate performance of a portfolio can be successful [00:25:21]. This highlights the importance of:
*   **Risk Control:** Keeping positions small enough to sustain trading through adverse conditions [00:24:46].
*   **Psychological Resilience:** The ability to move on from mistakes without succumbing to emotional distress [00:26:04].
*   **Portfolio-Level Thinking:** Focusing on the overall portfolio balance rather than individual positions, which might lead to cutting profitable trades prematurely [00:56:24].

He aims to exclude as much speculation as possible from his decisions, focusing on fundamental value [00:29:03]. For instance, during the March 2020 crisis, instead of just buying equity indices, he opted for dividend futures and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) [00:28:42].
*   **Dividend Futures:** These were chosen because it was highly likely that companies would resume paying dividends post-pandemic, offering a clear likelihood of recovery without needing to speculate on P/E multipliers [00:29:15].
*   **TIPS:** These were trading at "insane prices" [00:31:14], suggesting that inflation would have to be near zero for 30 years for current pricing to make sense [00:32:25]. This mispricing, coupled with the expectation of a post-deflationary inflation shock following massive liquidity injection by the Fed, made TIPS a compelling investment [00:32:32].

### Central Bank Coordination and Market Causality

Gorodaevich observes that central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve, tend to act as juggernauts, setting a policy and pushing it through, even if it seems "strange" at times [00:45:08]. This leads to [[understanding_the_political_implications_on_investments|causality flows]] in global markets [00:42:08]. For example, if the U.S. Fed aggressively raises rates while the ECB maintains negative rates, interest rate differentials will widen, the Euro will weaken, and the Dollar will strengthen [00:42:17]. Eventually, this will lead to inflation rising in Europe with a lag, forcing the ECB to respond [00:42:28].

While the Fed tends to lead in action, it's not always reflected in market pricing [00:43:40]. Gorodaevich notes a trend of reducing cycle duration and size of rate hikes over time [00:46:12], suggesting that future rate increases might be very limited [00:46:36]. He also believes that reducing the balance sheet (Quantitative Tightening) is a more logical step than raising rates, as the former itself causes tightening [00:46:55]. Aggressive balance sheet reduction could lead to repo panics, but this is viewed as a necessary process to de-leverage the market [00:48:20].

## The Unpredictable Nature of Markets

A recurring theme in Gorodaevich's career is the occurrence of unpredictable, high-impact events every few years [00:00:09], from the Asian Contagion and Russian Debt Crisis to 9/11, the Global Financial Crisis, Brexit, and the COVID-19 pandemic, culminating in the war in Europe [00:57:24]. These "something always happens" moments dictate the direction of global financial markets [00:58:26].

In such environments, it is crucial for traders to:
*   **Recognize the Unforeseen:** Understand that long-term positions must account for unpredictable future events [00:59:15].
*   **Adapt Rapidly:** Re-adjust and find new trades in the initial months following a crisis [00:58:44].
*   **Manage Psychology:** Maintain composure under extreme pressure, especially when personal feelings about global events might interfere with rational decision-making [00:59:00].
*   **Focus on the Big Picture:** Rather than being consumed by daily economic releases, which can be stale or misleading, concentrate on macro-level views of growth and inflation to construct trades [00:53:11]. This allows traders to focus on areas where they have a distinct advantage [00:53:36].

Ultimately, the most exciting part of trading is not merely making money, but conceiving a trade with high conviction, feeling that one has "figured it out" [00:41:12]. This pursuit of understanding and strategic execution defines the trading lifestyle [00:39:37].

When allocating money, investors place significant emphasis on a manager's research capability. However, other factors also play a crucial role in the selection process [02:44:00].

### Beyond the Numbers: The Individual and Trust
It is uncommon for investors to allocate funds to a manager they do not already know [03:37:00]. In addition to reviewing real results, assessing the personalities involved is critical to determine if an individual can be trusted with one's money [04:02:00]. The principles and individuals who founded a firm are of paramount importance; if they are not trustworthy, the quality of the rest of the firm may not matter [05:44:00].

### The Role of Due Diligence Questionnaires (DDQs)
Before making a substantial allocation, proper due diligence is essential, especially for institutional investors [04:19:00]. A Due Diligence Questionnaire (DDQ) is a standardized document, akin to a hedge fund's FAQ, typically a large booklet containing around 100 questions [04:34:00]. While anyone can write such a document, it should provide sufficient information for verification, saving significant time in the due diligence process [05:01:00].

Key information investors look for in due diligence includes:
*   What the managers have accomplished [06:52:00].
*   How long they have been in business [06:54:00].
*   Whether they are presenting real results or simulated results [06:55:00].
*   The structure of the firm, including its legal and offshore/onshore status [07:01:00]. Being based in a jurisdiction where legal action is difficult if something goes wrong is a concern [07:07:00].

### Longevity vs. Quality of Track Record
While some firms boast 30 to 40 years of track record, and others have just five years, the duration alone does not determine quality [07:35:00].

Factors to consider:
*   **Large Organizations:** Organizations that grow to a certain size, even if initially excellent, tend to become bureaucratic corporate machines [08:20:00]. An entity started by a great individual who performed excellently for 20 years might later be run by non-owner directors, leading to different operational views and potential issues like project managers and bureaucrats [08:45:00].
*   **Newer Managers:** A five-year manager can be excellent if they have been running a proper, audited hedge fund with a legitimate custodian and administrator [09:50:00]. This is considered a "decent track record" [10:11:00].
*   **Caution against Assumptions:** It is crucial never to assume a firm is great or bad solely based on how long it has existed [09:32:00].

### Understanding and Managing Risk
It is vital for investors to comprehend what they are investing in, including the potential for drawdowns [03:26:00].

> [01:37:00] **Disclaimer:** All discussions about investment performance refer to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or even infer anything about future performance. There is significant risk of financial loss with all investment strategies, and investors should request and understand specific risks from the investment manager before making decisions [01:44:00].

Investors should not seek the "best" investment strategy, but rather a "building block" that fits their existing portfolio [01:13:00]. A strategy's attractiveness also depends on its marketing [01:12:00].

A strategy offered to external investors should be clear and explainable; no one wants to buy a "black box system" [01:37:00]. Managers must be able to explain their rules and processes [01:58:00]. If a manager combines many different models, while mathematically sensible for in-house money, it may not make for a good product to sell [01:21:00].

### Communicating About Underperformance and Drawdowns
When a manager's results deviate from expectations, or if a loss occurs in a period where it shouldn't, investors should engage in a dialogue with the manager to seek an explanation [04:48:00]. Managers should be able to clarify how market conditions, such as a zero-yield environment, impact their performance [04:57:00]. If uncomfortable with the explanation, it may be prudent to exit the investment [04:34:00].

*   **Setting Expectations:** Investors must be informed about possible and unlikely drawdowns [03:30:00]. It is important to note that simulated drawdowns will almost certainly be larger in reality and likely occur sooner than anticipated [03:38:00]. Always assume that real-world outcomes will be worse than simulations [03:57:00].
*   **Planning for the Unexpected:** Managers must have a plan for unexpected events, such as a major market disruption like the 2008 financial crisis [04:07:00]. This includes considering liquidity, counterparty risk (e.g., bank solvency), and operational plans for extreme scenarios [04:12:00]. Such experiences from 2008 highlighted the need to plan for previously "unimaginable" events [04:25:00].

### Asking the Right Questions
Investors should not be afraid to ask detailed questions during due diligence [04:32:00]. This includes requesting to see position charts, entry and exit points, and attribution for market, sector, or long/short positions [04:46:00]. Most good managers are willing to provide thorough answers to these types of inquiries [05:33:00].

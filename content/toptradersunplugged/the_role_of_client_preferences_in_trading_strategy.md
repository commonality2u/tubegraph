From: [[toptradersunplugged]] <br/> 

In the world of trading, particularly within managed futures (CTAs), the influence of client preferences plays a significant role in shaping how trading firms operate and design their strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This influence extends beyond just investment performance, touching upon aspects like firm structure, risk management, and even the core design of trading methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Client-Driven Volatility Targeting

A notable trend in recent years, especially among highly successful CTAs, is the adoption of constant [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility targeting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This means firms aim for a specific [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] level (e.g., 10%, 15%, or 20% products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Richard Dennis, creator of the Turtle program, expressed not fully understanding the issue with [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]], suggesting that clients could simply modify their investment size if concerned about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

Jerry Parker, a "Turtle" and founder of Chesapeake Capital, believes that [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility targeting]] is primarily something clients desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He views it as a "more sophisticated way of taking profits before the trend," which he generally avoids to maintain his longer-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Jerry also considers daily returns with average fluctuations of 5% or more to be "too much [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. He considers [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility targeting]] to be "just another way of taking profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Brian Proctor, another "Turtle" and managing director of EMC Capital Advisors, noted that early investors (late 1980s) were more accepting of [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] and drawdown due to higher risk-free rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. As rates declined, so did investors' appetite for [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]], leading to demand for lower [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] products that better fit their mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. His firm has reduced [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] in their flagship program and developed newer programs with different [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] targets specifically for investors with those requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Jerry Parker views the widespread adoption of [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility targeting]] among large CTAs as a "problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. He suggests it contributes to market crashes, as managers might exit trades simultaneously when [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. He argues that this "systematic discretion" is a sophisticated way of programming "bad ideas" into a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

## Adaptation vs. Sticking to Principles

The question of whether to adapt [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] to changing markets or client demands is a core dilemma.

Jerry Parker expressed that he has changed the least among the Turtles in some ways, particularly by sticking to a longer-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. He has "no interest in the targeting" (of [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]]) because he understands clients want it, but he knows "better than going down that route" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Jerry believes that doing "things the clients want" can lead down a "bad path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of sticking with one's system and what one believes to be true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

> "Clients are [going to] lead you down a bad path so stick with your system stick with what you believe to be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>

Jerry also reflected on his own business, wondering if his adherence to original Turtle rules (not [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility targeting]], not taking profits early) had prevented him from building or maintaining a larger business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. He noted that some successful CTAs, who may not have had the same training and support as the Turtles, built large businesses by going out and working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

Brian Proctor highlighted that after the Turtle program, it became much harder to remain consistent, especially during long losing periods, as there's an inclination to make changes to avoid future difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

While acknowledging that [[The Impact of Market Conditions on Trading Strategies | markets continuously change]] and strategies need to adapt, Jerry Parker firmly believes that [[simplicity_in_trading_strategies | simple]], long-term trend-following rules still work effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He contrasts this with "optimizing to the recent data," which he considers a bad idea often driven by client preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>. Richard Dennis agreed that arguments suggesting [[Systematic trading strategies | systematic trading rules]] cannot consistently generate profits are "vastly overstated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

## Building a Trading Business Beyond Trading

The conversation also touched on whether a great trader is necessarily a brilliant business person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Jerry Parker suggested that some larger firms found initial investors who focused on building out infrastructure to raise assets and concentrate on "sales alpha" as much as "trading alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. This highlights the distinction between pure trading skill and the business acumen required to manage client relationships and grow a firm.

## Key Takeaways

*   **Client demands often drive changes in trading strategy implementation, particularly regarding [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility targeting]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **A tension exists between adapting strategies to client preferences and adhering to core, proven principles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Building a large trading business may require focusing on "sales alpha" and business infrastructure in addition to "trading alpha"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.
*   **Despite market changes, fundamental [[simplicity_in_trading_strategies | simple]] trend-following rules are still considered valid and effective** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the role of client preferences can be a double-edged sword, providing capital but also potentially pressuring traders to deviate from long-term, robust strategies in pursuit of short-term client comfort or perceived market adaptation.

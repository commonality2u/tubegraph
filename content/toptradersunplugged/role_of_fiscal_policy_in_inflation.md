Fiscal policy has seen a fundamental rethink in its conduct over the past couple of years, emerging as a significant driver of [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] [00:23:46]. This marks a shift from previous decades where there was an emphasis on balanced budgets, even though deficits were still growing [00:23:51].

## Fiscal Spending and Money Creation

When a sovereign government conducts fiscal spending and finances it by "printing debt," it is essentially financing it by printing money [00:24:16]. In the U.S. context, treasuries are considered money that pays interest, and the financial system's deep repo and cash markets make converting this debt into cash very easy, making it "very money-like" [00:24:27].

The U.S. is projected to have a trillion-dollar deficit annually for the next decade and beyond [00:25:03]. Additional spending, such as forgiving student loans, will further increase this deficit [00:25:10]. This revolutionary shift in how [[fiscal_policies_and_debt_management | fiscal policy]] is conducted is considered a primary driver of [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] [00:25:14].

## Impact on Monetary Policy

The ongoing fiscal spending makes the Federal Reserve's [[impact_of_fiscal_dominance_and_central_bank_policies | monetary policy]] less effective [00:25:23]. While the Fed can raise rates, [[fiscal_policies_and_debt_management | fiscal spending]] continues because public sector actors are not sensitive to costs, unlike private actors [00:25:37].

The federal government is the largest borrower, so when interest rates are raised, the government must borrow more [00:28:58]. To pay for this, they "print even more treasuries," creating a dynamic where increased rates can lead to more debt issuance, potentially forming a "doom loop" [00:29:20].

## Consequences: Inflationary Money Printing

If entities like pension funds incur tremendous losses, the government will likely make them whole, similar to forgiving student loans [00:41:27]. This involves the government essentially printing money, meaning that the money created never needs to be paid back [00:41:31]. The long-term outcome of this approach is not defaults or deflation, but rather [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflationary]] money printing [00:41:49]. This is considered an "easy lever" for governments to pull, and they have shown a willingness to deploy it [00:42:05].

Policy choices going forward may increasingly be "fiscally irresponsible" [00:44:35].

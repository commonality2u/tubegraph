India, the world's most populous country, is often portrayed as an emerging economic powerhouse and a potential "buffer" or "counterweight" to China, with institutions like McKinsey and Morgan Stanley expressing bullish views on its future [[02:51:00]]. However, a contrasting perspective, as detailed by Ashok Modi, author of *India is Broken*, suggests a more somber view of India's current state and future prospects [[03:39:09]].

Upon gaining independence in 1947, India faced three core challenges:
1.  Increasing agricultural productivity to make farmers more productive [[10:48:00]].
2.  Creating good jobs in cities for a growing population [[10:52:43]].
3.  Competing internationally [[10:57:00]].

Seventy-five years later, these challenges remain unmet, and concerns about India's democratic health have grown, with some referring to it as an "elected autocracy" where press freedom is eroded and violence is increasing [[11:12:00]].

## The East Asian Development Model: A Path Not Taken

A successful development model, followed by countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam, involves a fundamental shift of labor from low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity urban jobs [[12:59:00]].

Key components of this model include:
*   **Agricultural Productivity** Raising productivity in agriculture to reduce the need for people in that sector [[13:30:00]].
*   **Job Creation** Simultaneously creating urban jobs to absorb the freed agricultural workforce, primarily through manufacturing [[13:36:40]].
*   **Competitive Currency** Utilizing aggressive currency devaluation to make goods competitive internationally, creating demand for exports [[15:59:01]].
*   **Education** Prioritizing universal primary and secondary education to build a highly educated and productive workforce, alongside bringing women into the workforce [[16:10:00]]. As noted by Oded Galor, "every country that has industrialized has educated its kids and has brought women into the workforce" [[16:57:00]].
*   **Quality Improvement** Initially producing "relatively shoddy goods" but continuously learning and upgrading quality based on global market demands, as seen with companies like Samsung evolving from assembling parts to becoming industry leaders [[18:18:23]].

India, for the first 35 years after independence, did not adopt these choices [[15:45:00]].

## India's Chosen Path: The "Building Temples" Model

India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, pursued a development strategy focused on "building temples" [[19:41:00]]. This involved:
*   **Heavy Industry Focus** Emphasizing heavy industry and large projects like aerospace and locomotive manufacturing [[19:54:00]].
*   **Elite Education** Prioritizing tertiary education and establishing elite institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) [[21:05:00]].

### Outcomes and Challenges of this Model
This approach led to several long-term issues:
*   **Limited Job Creation** The skill base developed was geared towards capital-intensive heavy industry, which did not create enough jobs for the growing population [[20:52:00]].
*   **Neglect of Mass Education** The vast majority of the population did not attend primary school for a long time, and even with increased enrollment, poor teaching quality and corruption persist. Many fifth-grade students struggle with second-grade tasks, and 30% drop out before high school [[21:29:00]].
*   **"Two Indias"** A significant [[social_and_economic_divide_in_india | social and economic divide]] emerged:
    *   A small elite (10-15% of the population) that is well-educated, lives "First World lives," and can access private schools, international colleges, high-quality healthcare, and navigate the judicial system [[23:51:00]]. This group is often the focus of Western media's positive narratives about India's economic success [[24:00:00]].
    *   The remaining 80-85% of the population, for whom education, healthcare, and women's workforce participation have fallen significantly behind East Asian standards [[24:22:00]].
*   **Jobs Deficit** Focusing on GDP growth, often driven by the elite sector, masked a severe and growing "jobs deficit" for the majority, estimated to be over 100 million jobs [[24:59:00]]. This leads to widespread underemployment [[25:21:00]].
*   **Environmental Degradation** The capital-intensive development model has also led to significant [[environmental_and_urban_development_issues_in_india | environmental degradation]], with Indian cities competing for the top spots among the most polluted in the world [[27:06:00]]. Unplanned [[environmental_and_urban_development_issues_in_india | urban development]] has built over natural water bodies, causing severe flooding even with mild downpours [[48:33:00]].

## The Gujarat Model: A Modern Reinforcement

The "Gujarat Model of Development," championed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his time as chief minister, is seen as a modern iteration of the "building temples" strategy [[34:43:00]]. This model involved:
*   **Generous Subsidies for Big Business** Providing incentives such as relatively cheap land, low-interest loans, and lax environmental clearances [[35:22:00]].
*   **Capital-Intensive Growth** While leading to high GDP growth rates and large corporate profits, this model remained capital-intensive (e.g., petrochemical plants), generating very few jobs [[35:56:00]].
*   **Continued Environmental Impact** It further exacerbated environmental degradation, "chewing up the inheritance of your kids" [[37:25:00]].

Despite claims in 2014 that the Gujarat model would solve India's problems, it did little for agriculture, failed to develop sufficient jobs, and did not significantly enhance India's manufacturing sector's global competitiveness [[38:52:00]]. India's share of global manufactured goods exports has stagnated at around 1.8% since 2012, while Vietnam has rapidly caught up [[39:15:00]].

## Consequences: Suppression and Dysfunction

The persistent jobs deficit and the failure to improve the lives of the majority have profound social and political consequences:

*   **Suppression of Dissent** The lack of widespread anger or protest in the face of these challenges is attributed to:
    *   The state's coercive power, exemplified by the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which allows detention without timely trial [[28:46:00]]. This tool has been used "on steroids" by recent governments to suppress protests [[29:37:00]].
    *   The allure of low-grade criminal activity and organized crime, such as illegal sand mining, which is a major source of organized crime and leads to criminals entering politics [[29:53:00]].
    *   The channeling of frustrated youth into Hindu nationalism (Hindutva) [[30:05:00]].
*   **Erosion of Data Integrity** There is an "informational fog" surrounding crucial economic statistics [[44:04:00]]:
    *   Employment statistics are under a cloud, with official numbers showing "enormous job growth" often dismissed as "complete nonsense" by experts [[41:35:00]].
    *   Poverty surveys showing increased poverty have been discarded by the government [[43:12:00]].
    *   The national census, due in 2021, has been postponed indefinitely, contributing to the data vacuum [[43:43:00]].
    *   The narrative of India being the "fastest growing economy in the world" is based on extrapolating from bounce-back periods after sharp declines, which is deemed "wishful thinking, gardening clothes, and bad economics" [[44:52:00]].
*   **Erosion of Press Freedom** Independent press voices are not welcome and face consequences such as investigations for tax evasion or non-compliance with rules. Think tanks critical of the government have been deprived of foreign funding, compromising their operations [[53:19:00]]. This contradicts the perception of India as a land of many voices [[52:02:00]].
*   **Crime and Politics Nexus** A significant concern is the growing nexus between crime and politics. As of today, 25% of legislators in the Indian national Parliament are accused of serious crimes, including rape, murder, extortion, and kidnapping. In some state governments, like Bihar, this figure rises to 50% [[50:09:00]]. This creates a "bad equilibrium" where efforts to reduce criminality in politics have failed for decades because no one with power has an incentive to change it [[50:43:00]].

## Future Prospects

India is currently described as neither a strong economy nor a strong democracy, categorized as an "electoral autocracy" by institutions like Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) [[55:51:00]].

The task of reform is challenging due to the deep-rooted "bad equilibrium" [[01:01:00]]. Ashok Modi suggests that change must begin at the local level, focusing on local democracy, to rebuild trust and cooperation [[58:59:00]]. This local renewal could then filter up to address broader issues like health, education, a fair judiciary, and environmental policies [[59:13:00]]. While acknowledging historical precedents of reform in other countries (e.g., the US), India's current situation is described as a "deeper bad equilibrium," making the task harder [[01:00:26]].

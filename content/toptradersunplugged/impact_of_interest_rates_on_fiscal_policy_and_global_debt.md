The global economy is moving towards an era of fiscal restraint, driven by necessity due to rising debt service costs following an [[Impact of rising interest rates on markets | interest rate shock]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This rise in debt service costs directly impacts program spending and has "brutal implications for fiscal finances in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Current Fiscal Challenges

Rising [[Impact of interest rates and bond market movements | interest rates]] have led to inexorably increasing debt service costs, which are cutting into government program spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This situation suggests a potential "fiscal crisis" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This is exacerbated by a demographic shift where more high-income individuals are leaving the labor market, and younger, lower-tax-paying individuals are entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Compared to the 1920s, current global balance sheets, especially in the public sector, are significantly more strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Unlike the 1920s, when tax rates were coming down due to a better fiscal position, today's levels of debt are unsustainable, indicating that fiscal restraint will be the future norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

## Addressing High Debt Levels

The challenge of high debt levels raises the question of how they will be resolved. Several historical or theoretical approaches are often discussed:

*   **Inflation:** Attempts to "inflate our way out of it" are generally not supported by central banks, as seen by the Federal Reserve's aggressive actions to combat inflation, viewing it as a "social disease" and a "tax on the poor and its attacks on the elderly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **Default:** Defaulting on debt is seen as unlikely, as it would severely impact major bondholders like pension funds that pay retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.
*   **Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) / Debt Monetization:** These approaches are considered to be "passed" as viable solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Austerity:** This is presented as the most likely path forward. Canada's experience in the 1990s, where fiscal austerity measures — including means-testing for entitlements — led to a more stable fiscal footing, is cited as a historical precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.

A critical inflection point for a fiscal crisis could be a "failed auction" of government bonds, where bids are not fully filled. This nearly occurred in Canada in 1995, prompting a significant shift to fiscal restraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

The future is predicted to be one of "fiscal restraint" globally, driven by "utter necessity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. This restraint will negatively impact aggregate demand growth relative to supply, contributing to disinflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

The cost of capital in the United States and real [[Interest rates and monetary policy | interest rates]] will be affected by a profound change in the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency, as countries like China and Russia explore alternative trading currencies like the RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. Central banks bolstering their gold reserves further supports this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>.

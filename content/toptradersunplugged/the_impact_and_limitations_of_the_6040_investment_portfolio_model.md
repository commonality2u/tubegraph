The 60/40 investment portfolio model, allocating 60% to stocks and 40% to bonds, has long been a foundational concept in [[Investment strategies and asset allocation | investment strategies]] and [[Optimal portfolio allocation strategies | optimal portfolio allocation strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, its effectiveness and underlying assumptions are increasingly being questioned, particularly in the current economic climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## The Traditional Rationale and Its Flaws

The premise of the 60/40 model is to build an [[Investment Portfolio | investment portfolio]] that performs well in extreme conditions rather than just expected ones, emphasizing resilience for what is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Historically, the 40% bond allocation was believed to provide diversification and protection to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Artificial Correlation and the "Sharp World"

The perceived benefit of the 60/40 model, specifically the negative correlation between bonds and stocks, was artificially generated from the "Greenspan put era" onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This period saw central banks implementing a reaction function of cutting interest rates when asset prices fell, creating a multi-decade "faux benefit" of holding bonds and stocks together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This artificial correlation reduced the capital requirement of portfolios and provided a positive carry correlation benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Critics refer to the traditional financial mathematics supporting this model as "Sharp World," encompassing concepts like random walk, Gaussian normal distribution, efficient market hypothesis, modern portfolio theory, Capital Asset Pricing Model, Sharp Ratio, and Value at Risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This framework is seen as having "conspired for the financial fiduciary industry" to enrich themselves at the expense of long-term compounding for capital owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The "Sharp World" fantasy land assumes historical volatilities and correlations remain constant, geometric compounding paths are irrelevant, tails are never fat, leverage is not risk, frequency matters more than magnitude, and ensemble averages dominate time averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## The Model's Demise

The inherent flaw in the 60/40 model became apparent when interest rates reached zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. At this point, the bond allocation ceased to be risk-mitigating and instead became risk-additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Quantitative easing (QE) further exacerbated this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

> "Inflation is upon us, 60/40 is dead." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>

In 2022, investors experienced significant losses in their bond portfolios, sometimes even exceeding losses in stock portfolios, a stark contrast to the expected balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. For example, a large Danish pension fund reported a 47% loss of their strategic reserve capital in nine months in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Why "Smart Investors" Missed the Risk

Despite seemingly simple math indicating the unsustainability of the 60/40 structure once rates hit zero, many large pension funds and massive portfolios failed to see this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This blindness is attributed to the incentive structure of the financial fiduciary industry, which bought into debt through a "Sharp World" mathematical risk regulatory accounting and annual return incentive structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This allowed governments worldwide to surpass 100% debt-to-GDP ratios, with savers "duped into it" through pension funds, insurance companies, and banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

With zero or negative interest rates, bonds no longer compounded returns effectively, making it nearly impossible to recover significant losses at low coupon rates, especially amidst high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Fragility and Uncapitalized Tails

The fragility in the financial system, particularly evident in the current environment, stems from "uncapitalized tails" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. The 60/40 model, along with similar [[Optimal portfolio allocation strategies | optimal portfolio allocation strategies]] like LDI (liability-driven investment) and risk parity, deemed the 40% bond allocation as risk-reducing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This led to a reduction in the capital held against the 60% stock portion and even less capital for the 40% bond portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The UK's LDI investments, for example, exposed their pension system to the Bank of England's inability to let long-dated gilt yields rise above 4% without blowing up leveraged versions of "Sharp World" optimized portfolios, even while fighting 10-12% inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Pension funds became forced panic sellers of bonds when yields went up, rather than the expected buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

This situation forces central banks to walk a tightrope: they cannot raise rates so much that they blow up leveraged fixed income savings pools, but they need to raise rates enough to restore price stability, otherwise inflation will destroy the fixed income markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This creates a system where the system's stability relies on containing volatility, but decreased liquidity (due to central bank actions) amplifies dynamic shifts, potentially leading to larger "fat tail" events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## A New Philosophy: Convexity and Resilience

Instead of forecasting, a more robust [[Investment strategy and market analysis | investment strategy]] emphasizes understanding and acting on potential asymmetry and convexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. This approach focuses on what is unknown, recognizing that extremes, rather than the mean, drive long-term compounded returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

> "It's not predicting what you think you know, it's constructing resilience for what you don't know." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>

This perspective likens an investment portfolio to a Formula One race car, where "brakes" (long convexity, or volatility absorption) are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>. These "brakes" allow the "car" (the portfolio) to drive faster and participate more efficiently in upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. The cost of these "brakes" should be seen as an essential component, similar to the guaranteed deposits that allow banks to lend and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

This approach often involves finding "cheap" volatility or areas where there's an "uncapitalized tail" due to supply/demand imbalances or central bank suppression of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Examples include interest rate volatility in complex structured products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, particularly in markets like Japan and China, where central banks actively suppress volatility and provide liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The true losses from uncapitalized tails are often hidden within the system, not yet marked to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

In conclusion, the traditional 60/40 model, reliant on artificial correlations and flawed mathematical assumptions, has shown its significant limitations. A focus on convexity and resilience, preparing for the unexpected extremes rather than merely forecasting, is proposed as a more robust approach to navigate the inherent [[Investment Strategies and Risks | risks]] and [[Investment Challenges and Opportunities | challenges]] in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

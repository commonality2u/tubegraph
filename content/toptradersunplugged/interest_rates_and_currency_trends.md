Financial astrologer Mahendra Sharma offers insights into the future of [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates]] and [[global_economic_conditions_and_currency_trends | global currency movements]], drawing on his "wave of nature" theory and astrological cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of understanding long-term trends and the collective human behavior influenced by planetary movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Interest Rate Outlook

Sharma initially predicted a drastic rise in [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates]] in 2016-2017, potentially reaching 6-7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. While rates did rise slightly in 2016-2018 due to Fed increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>, the dramatic surge did not occur.

Looking ahead, Sharma forecasts a significant turning point around **2024-2025** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. He believes that after 2024, [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates]] will "go to the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>, marking a major shift that economists and analysts may find hard to predict due to existing mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. Interestingly, this period of soaring [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates]] is also expected to coincide with rising [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold]] prices, suggesting a potential breakdown of trust in traditional government and financial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

## Currency Predictions

### US Dollar
Sharma has a track record of accurate [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | dollar]] predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. He predicts the [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | Dollar Index]] may bottom out around the **91 level** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>, and explicitly states it will **not go below 89.11** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:31">[00:55:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.

While he anticipates volatility, with the [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | dollar]] potentially gaining to 95-96 and then dipping before returning to 97 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>, he does not foresee a strong [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | dollar]] making new highs above 104 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:54">[00:54:54]</a>.

### Euro

Sharma expressed concern about the Euro as a currency as early as 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:52">[00:55:52]</a>.

He advises investors to be very careful around this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>, as the Euro could lose 40-50% of its value, potentially affecting the real estate and global equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:43">[00:58:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>.

The Mexican Peso and South African Rand have already seen significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:33">[00:53:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. For 2021, the **Brazilian Real** is highlighted as a top investment, with the potential to gain 25-30% against the [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | dollar]] and pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:45">[00:53:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

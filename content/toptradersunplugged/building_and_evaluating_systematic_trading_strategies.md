## Mental Resilience in Trading
To succeed long-term in trading, it's crucial to manage stress and avoid worrying about market problems outside of work hours. If you constantly worry about over-risk every evening, you will not mentally last in the game [00:00:02]. The idea of spending 80 hours a week in the office, including evenings and weekends, is an illusion that cannot be maintained as you get older [00:00:28].

## Evaluating Investment Managers and Strategies
Investors, particularly institutional ones, place significant emphasis on a manager's research capability, which is considered the "heart" of a [[systematic_trading_strategies | systemic manager]] [00:02:44].

### Key Factors for Allocating Money
When looking to allocate money to a manager, several factors are considered:
*   **Prior Knowledge** It is rare to invest in a manager one doesn't already know [00:03:37].
*   **Due Diligence** Meeting managers multiple times and conducting proper due diligence is essential [00:03:49]. Institutional investors expect a Due Diligence Questionnaire (DDQ), a standardized document with many questions that provides verifiable information and saves time [00:04:22].
*   **Trust and Personality** The individual personalities of the managers are critical; investors need to trust them with their money [00:04:05]. The key individuals founding and running the firm are more important than the number of PhDs on staff [00:05:25]. It is important to understand how they run their business and if their approach aligns with your goals [00:06:05]. Personal contact is important, and funds that appear too self-important should be avoided [00:06:36].
*   **Transparency and Structure** Important aspects to review include their accomplishments, how long they've been in business, whether they show real or simulated results, their overall structure, and their legal jurisdiction (e.g., onshore vs. offshore) [00:06:52].

### Understanding Track Records
The length of a track record needs careful evaluation [00:07:31]. While some firms have 30-40 years of history, very large organizations can become bureaucratic and corporate machines, potentially losing the drive of their original founders [00:08:15]. It's crucial not to assume a long track record is automatically good or bad [00:09:32]. A five-year track record from a properly audited hedge fund with a custodian and administrator is considered a decent record [00:10:01].

### Performance of [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | Trend Following]]
Regarding the perception that [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] has performed poorly since the 2008 financial crisis due to too much money flowing into the strategy:
*   There have been both good and bad years since 2008, but overall, most funds have made very good money [00:11:07].
*   It's a common pastime for journalists to write about when [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] stops working, often based on a few months or a year of poor performance [00:11:23].
*   While [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] may not deliver the same extreme performances as in the 1980s or 1990s, it still typically outperforms traditional asset classes [00:11:36].

## Designing [[systematic_trading_systems | Systematic Trading Systems]]
When designing [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic strategies]] for external clients, clarity and explainability are paramount [00:17:29]. Investors do not want to buy a "black box" system; they need to understand the concepts behind it [00:17:42]. Explaining the rules of the system is often beneficial, especially for interested investors [00:18:01].

### Position Sizing
Position sizing is a critical aspect of [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]].
*   It is crucial to have a logical model for position sizing [00:20:02].
*   The concept of increasing position size based on recent good performance ("playing with the bank's money") is ill-advised because past performance does not necessarily impact future probabilities [00:20:56].
*   A preferred approach involves variations of volatility-based position sizing, where a certain risk is allocated based on a volatility measurement (e.g., Average True Range or ATR) [00:21:28].
*   Since volatility and portfolio value are not static, positions need to be rebalanced at certain intervals or threshold levels to maintain the target risk [00:21:52].
*   The focus should be on the portfolio level of risk management, not just individual positions, as single positions are largely irrelevant in a diversified [[systematic_trading_strategies | systemic model]] that trades many markets and instruments [00:22:27].

### Entry and Exit Signals
The importance of entry and exit signals in a strategy's success is debated. Some simple models can be successful even with very basic exit strategies, such as exiting after a set number of days regardless of performance [00:25:07]. It's difficult to make absolute statements about which component (entry, exit, or position sizing) is most important, as "it all depends" on the specific trading model [00:25:40].

### Environmental Filters and Diversification
*   **Trend Filters** Using "trend filters" or other environmental measures is helpful, especially for equities, to understand the market's prevailing direction [00:26:41]. This provides an idea of where prices are more likely to move in a certain time horizon [00:26:56].
*   **Diversification Across Markets** Diversification is crucial for classical [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] strategies [00:27:32].
*   **Sector Allocation** While it's possible to ignore sector allocation to some degree, for some models, especially in equities, sector restraints might be necessary to prevent over-concentration (e.g., 85% of stocks in one country) [00:28:15].
*   **Corner Risk in Futures** [[systematic_trading_strategies | Futures models]] often involve deliberately taking "corner risks," which means high-risk concentrations in a particular area (e.g., shorting an entire complex like crude oil and related products when they are all dropping) [00:29:14]. While this can lead to concentrated hits, it often generates significant returns in the long run [00:30:02].

## Risk Management
Defining risk is complex and "it all depends" on the context, such as the organization's size and structure [00:34:28].
*   **Risk Measures** While complex measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and marginal VaR are used, their benefit is primarily for large organizations with many staff members who need aggregated risk views [00:35:19]. Smaller teams, with managers fully aware of every position, can use simpler methods, even Excel [00:35:56].
*   **Stop Losses** The use of stop losses varies by trading approach [00:36:37]. For equity markets, traditional stop losses may not be used, with other methods to halt or close positions [00:37:02]. For some [[systematic_trading_strategies | futures models]], especially counter-trend models, stop losses are absolutely vital due to the potential for large moves when trading against the prevailing pressure [00:37:15].
*   **Drawdowns** The most important aspect of drawdowns is ensuring investors understand what is possible, unlikely, and that simulated drawdowns will likely be exceeded in reality [00:38:26]. Keeping investors knowledgeable about the strategy and its risks, including potential drawdowns, is key to retaining them [00:38:47]. When estimating potential drawdowns, one should examine historical worst-case scenarios from simulations and assume actual outcomes will be worse, also planning for unexpected, extreme events [00:39:44].
*   **Strength of [[systematic_trading_strategies | Systematic Trading]] in Crisis** For "normal" bad markets, [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] excels because there is always a predetermined plan, unlike discretionary trading [00:40:47]. However, during extreme, unexpected events like the 2008 financial crisis, even [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic models]] can break down, particularly their risk management components, requiring manual overrides or plans for unforeseen issues like banks going bust and cash management [00:41:02]. Such events, though previously unimaginable, now require planning [00:42:25].
*   **Mental Well-being** Worrying about risk when going to sleep indicates a problem that will prevent long-term success in the business. It's essential to deal with problems during work hours and disengage when away from work [00:43:09].

## Research and Continuous Learning
When considering asset allocation and [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investing strategies]], key questions include:
*   What is the objective (e.g., capital preservation vs. wealth building)? [00:45:15]
*   What level of risk is acceptable, especially for long-term goals like a family office? [00:45:41]
*   What building blocks are needed, and how do they fit together (high-risk, low-risk, different strategies)? [00:45:56]
*   It's important to be open-minded and explore new areas and types of strategies, as new opportunities can emerge [00:46:32].

### Detecting Underperforming Strategies
If a manager's [[systematic_trading_strategies | strategy]] appears to have stopped working, engage in dialogue with the manager to get an explanation [00:47:46]. This helps determine if results are genuinely off, if there's an unexpected market factor, or if the manager is "chasing something" [00:47:53]. If uncomfortable with the explanation, it's prudent to exit the investment [00:48:33]. Never accept a "black box" explanation of "don't worry, just trust me" [00:48:38].

### Questions to Ask Managers During Due Diligence
Investors are often hesitant to ask too many questions for fear of seeming impolite or intrusive [00:49:35]. However, there is no harm in asking, and managers should provide good answers [00:49:46]. Questions to ask include:
*   Asking to see example charts with entries and exits and the reasoning behind them [00:49:53].
*   If combining strategies or time horizons, ask for attribution analysis for each component, or for specific markets/sectors [00:50:07].
Many successful managers are willing to provide detailed answers if asked [00:50:25].

### The Role of Programming Books
Generally speaking, individuals looking to improve their trading will find more value in reading programming books than general trading books [00:55:17]. While there are great trading books, many people read too many of them and too few programming books [00:55:23]. This highlights [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | the role of systematic trading and programming skills]].

## Personal Philosophy
*   **Motivation** The motivation for continuing in the trading business comes from finding enjoyment in the work, having the freedom to pursue interesting activities like writing books, managing money in various ways, running a website, and publishing analytics [00:51:16]. Life is too short for a "crappy job" [00:51:28].
*   **Influential Books** Jack Schwager's "Market Wizards" books, particularly the first two, had a significant impact [00:53:02]. A book titled "Create and Manage Your Hedge Funds" also opened eyes to the possibility of starting a hedge fund [00:53:51]. More recent impactful books include "Following the Trend with Managed Futures" by Kathryn Kaminski [00:54:13] and "Dual Momentum" by Gary Antonacci, which offers a different perspective on momentum strategies [00:54:36].
*   **Biggest Failure** Experiencing significant losses, such as being fully loaded in Japanese stocks during the tsunami and nuclear accident, felt like the "end of the world" at the time [00:55:59]. However, with time, recovery is possible, and these incidents do not seem as large in retrospect [00:56:21].
*   **Hidden Talent** A hidden talent shared is winning a chess tournament as a non-club player in a small town [00:57:16].
*   **Skill to Pass On** The most valuable skill to pass on is an "inability to conform" [00:58:18]. This means not accepting nonsense in life, making your own rules, and not passively accepting whatever is imposed upon you, even if it makes you difficult to manage in a corporate environment [00:58:30]. This philosophy is crucial for navigating both personal and professional challenges [00:59:07].

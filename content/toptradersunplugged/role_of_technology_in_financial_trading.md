The co-founders of AHL (Adam, Harding, and Lewis), pioneers in [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | systematic trading]] and trend-following strategies, extensively leveraged [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | technology]] to build their groundbreaking firm. Their approach to financial markets was heavily influenced by the capabilities and advancements in computing and software, setting them apart in an industry that was largely traditional at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>.

## Early Automation and Programming
The journey into [[the_role_of_automation_in_trading | automation]] for Michael Adam began out of "laziness," when a computer arrived in his family's brokerage office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:23">[04:20:23]</a>. With no one else interested, he took to it and created a database to draw charts and an accounting package for bookkeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>. This marked the beginning of his interest in computer programming and its applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:42">[04:40:42]</a>. Marty Lewis, who had learned to program during university holidays, was drawn to the "fun" of coding an early Hewlett-Packard workstation with Michael <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:04">[06:01:04]</a>.

The early trading portfolio, starting with just Â£25,000, was managed using models developed by banging around ideas until a "useful model" was distilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:52">[06:50:52]</a>. The only available data at the time was for physical commodity markets, leading to an initial focus on commodities like cocoa, coffee, sugar, and base metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:57">[06:57:57]</a>.

## Systematic Trading and Scientific Approach
The AHL founders were among the few who believed it was possible to trade markets [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | systematically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:07">[05:04:07]</a>. David Harding noted that their software was "well in advance" of what was typically seen in banks and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:01">[09:01:01]</a>. Their [[use_of_technology_in_hedge_fund_management | use of technology in hedge fund management]] allowed them to:
*   **Test Ideas**: The software enabled them to "take my ideas and test them and turn them into reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:06">[09:08:06]</a>.
*   **Replicate Manual Processes**: They observed that algorithms could produce the same results as arcane technical analysis, which was a striking realization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Empiricism**: As physicists by training, they approached financial markets with an "experimental look at the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[01:11:48]</a>, enabling them to conduct "good experiments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[01:11:57]</a>. This contrasted with the prevailing orthodoxy of efficient market theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Inquisitiveness**: They had a constant drive to improve, asking "what if I try that, what if I expand this, what if I add a new market, what if I go faster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[01:12:50]</a>.

## Technological Advancements and Innovation
The timing was crucial, as [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | technology]] became affordable enough to acquire "pretty serious processing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[01:13:10]</a>. This allowed them to run experiments that most others couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[01:13:41]</a>. They were constantly waiting for new, more powerful Hewlett-Packard monitors to run experiments that took many hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[01:13:45]</a>.

These technological capabilities led to "groundbreaking discoveries," including:
*   **Time-Varying Volatility**: Michael Adam discovered a "normalization that you can use for making historical time series simulation more robust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[01:16:30]</a>.
*   **Risk Assessment**: They moved to using an exponential schema for [[risk_management_techniques_in_trading | assessing risk]] and normalizing markets, which is now a regulatory standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[01:18:37]</a>.
*   **Market Making Insight**: Through consulting work, they discovered that trend-following strategies could model the P&L of Guild market makers, revealing that trend-following is a systematic way of thinking about market making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[01:19:07]</a>. This insight highlighted the critical importance of market access costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Focus on Execution Costs**: This led them to meticulously measure the "full cost of market access from the point of sampling to the point of execution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[01:19:57]</a>, driving them to set up their own trading desk and interact directly with the market floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[01:20:05]</a>. This focus made them unique and often unpopular with brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[01:20:15]</a>, who traditionally benefited from wider spreads and slower execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[01:33:52]</a>.

Their software also featured innovative visualizations, such as "heat maps" on personal computers with good color graphics, which impressed others in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[01:23:13]</a>.

## Industry Context and Evolution
In the early days (mid-1980s), the [[the_role_of_automation_in_trading | managed futures]] industry was tiny and often met with skepticism, considered "eccentric and kooks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[01:35:35]</a>. *The Economist* even wrote an article dismissing their work, asserting that markets were efficient and their efforts were a "waste of time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[01:35:51]</a>. [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | Systematic trading]] was considered "heresy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:37:00">[01:36:37]</a>.

However, the late 1980s and early 1990s saw a global emergence of firms adopting similar [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | computer simulation]] and quantitative approaches, such as Renaissance Technologies (James Simons), Winton Capital (David Harding), and Citadel (Ken Griffin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[01:39:39]</a>. This was driven by the opening of financial markets, the emergence of [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | technology]], and access to relatively cheap processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[01:40:26]</a>. People with backgrounds in commodity markets, who were familiar with futures structures, were particularly well-positioned to exploit these new financial futures markets as they opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:53:00">[01:40:53]</a>. Their ability to normalize data allowed them to add new markets immediately, gaining immediate diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:25:00">[01:41:25]</a>.

The use of [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | systematic rules]] and [[risk_management_and_system_development_in_trading | institutionalized research and development]] processes contributed to building a robust money management system that was "more robust than any discretionary trader shooting from the hip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[01:42:28]</a>. This reliance on [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | technology]] and a scientific mindset enabled AHL to build a lasting institution in the financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[01:42:16]</a>.

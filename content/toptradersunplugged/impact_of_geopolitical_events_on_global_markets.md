The global landscape is currently shifting from a unipolar or bipolar distribution of power to a more multipolar world, which has significant implications for financial markets and global dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This transition, which arguably began in the early 2010s, marks the end of an era of American hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## The Shift to a Multipolar World

The world is characterized by multiple centers of power, rather than one dominant country (unipolar) or two major blocs (bipolar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While the United States has actively tried to create a clear bipolar structure, believing it would solve many of its problems by forcing other nations like Europe, Japan, South Korea, and India to choose a side, this has not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. If such a bipolar reality were established, it would be "game over" for Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### End of American Hegemony
For a unipolar world to exist, one country must possess an overwhelming "preponderance of power" to compel others to follow its will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This kind of unipolar world existed since the 1990s, following a period of bipolarity during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. These unipolar or bipolar distributions of power were orderly and easy to model for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. However, this era has now ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While the U.S. remains the most powerful country, it no longer holds the "preponderance of power" needed to dominate as it once did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

### Consequences of Multipolarity
A multipolar global order has both negative and potentially positive consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Increased Conflicts**: Conflicts become easier to form because there are no longer one or two dominant powers to keep the world in check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Technological and Industrial Innovation**: Geopolitical competition can lead to significant technological and industrial innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Governments become more involved in financing true technological breakthroughs and states focus on developing domestic capacities and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Higher Volatility Baseline**: The world experiences a higher baseline volatility, but stocks and risk assets may still perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This is because there can be a higher frequency of conflicts with less relevance to global macro investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For example, the Ukraine-Russia conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict have largely fallen into the background for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Investment Implications and Unpriced Factors

Investors are currently heavily focused on the US election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The election acts as a "macro black hole," bending time and space around it, influencing decisions like the Federal Reserve taking "left tail risks" off the table ahead of the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### Shift in Economic Policy
The world is also experiencing a shift away from laissez-faire capitalism (Reagan-Thatcher revolution) towards more dirigiste or state-led capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This shift is partly driven by wealth inequality and populism, leading to protectionism and increased government spending on domestic capacities and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Unpriced Inflation Expectations
A significant mispricing in the market is the long-term inflation expectations, which have remained anchored despite profound changes in globalization, energy policies, and trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This complacency echoes the early 1960s, which set the stage for the inflationary 1970s due to pro-cyclical fiscal policies and domestic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

> "Everybody woke up one day after 2020 decided China's evil. Everybody woke up one day decided climate change is going to kill us within not next 30 Years but 5 Years everybody woke up in the side a we need to uh aate all trade with the largest commodity expor in the world which is Russia everybody woke up and said ah free trade no say all that Les Fair stuff that was 100% wrong let's go into this deista let's grow our way into productivity you know fiscal spending will give us new techologies everybody woke up at the same time and shifted this way and the five five forward hasn't budged long-term inflation has have a bunch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>

The disconnect between long-term inflation expectations and the rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield suggests that the fair value yield could be much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Similarly, high gold prices relative to long-term real rates imply that either gold is due for a collapse or long-term inflation expectations are wrong and gold is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

### Geopolitical Trends vs. Events
In a multipolar world with a higher frequency of conflict, it's more important to invest in [[geopolitical_and_macroeconomic_factors_influencing_markets | geopolitical trends]] rather than react to fleeting [[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | geopolitical events]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While events may cause short-term volatility, their global impact may be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Regional Dynamics in a Multipolar World

### Europe's Resilience and Opportunity
Europe is seen as a compelling investment opportunity, particularly for European Industrials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. The energy crisis of 2022, spurred by Russian aggression in Ukraine, acted as a "wake-up call" for Europe, forcing it to confront geopolitical realities and reduce its dependence on the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

*   **Energy Security**: Europe is rapidly achieving energy security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>. Germany, for instance, built several import terminals in three months, significantly faster than the expected two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. Coupled with new Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supply coming online from Qatar, Russia, Canada, and the US, Europe is expected to be "flooded" with LNG in the next two years, leading to cheap electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>. Europe will be in a "buyers' market" for LNG, able to play off LNG cargos against Russian pipeline natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.
*   **Industrial Strength**: Despite concerns about de-industrialization, European Industrials are well-positioned as they are skilled at building machinery and capital expenditure goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>. The market has already rewarded Europe, with the DAX at all-time highs despite a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Awareness**: Europe is becoming more geopolitically aware and will likely integrate further to become a more significant geopolitical actor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. The existential risk of the Euro's viability is dissipating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Russia and China's Relationship
The relationship between China and Russia is not a true "bipolar conflict" alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. Despite the "endless friendship agreement" between Xi and Putin, China has not provided significant military help to Russia and has maintained an arms embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>.

China's interests align more with global stability, as seen by its role in the Middle East, which often shares interests with the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>. China aims to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Europe, hence its careful approach to supporting Russia and its efforts to improve commercial relations with Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

### China's Domestic Focus and Taiwan
China is currently focused on a revival of its domestic economy, which is in a "secular stagnation" and requires external demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
Regarding Taiwan, China is unlikely to invade in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. China has learned from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, observing the Western response and the impact of civil society actions (e.g., corporates leaving Russia without government interference) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. The Chinese Communist Party can maintain legitimacy without conquering Taiwan, and the risk of economic collapse from global protectionism is a much larger concern than not resolving the Taiwan issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>.

### Geopolitical Promiscuity
In a multipolar world, smaller or non-aligned countries, particularly those in the Global South (e.g., Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Brazil), are increasingly aware that neither China nor the U.S. possess the overwhelming power of Cold War-era superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. This allows them to be "geopolitically promiscuous," flipping and flopping between poles, and potentially benefiting from both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. This dynamic prevents the formation of clear, rigid alliances seen in a true bipolar world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

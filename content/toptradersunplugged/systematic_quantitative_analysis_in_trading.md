[[Systematic quantitative analysis in trading]] is an investment approach that assumes all relevant market information is reflected in price, utilizing quantitative analysis to identify predictable trends for profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. This approach aims to deliver long-term positive returns with low correlation to other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:01">[08:51:01]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Objectives
The fundamental philosophy is that markets consistently trend, yielding identifiable and repeatable profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:32">[08:32:32]</a>. The objective is to develop and implement [[systematic_trading_strategies | quantitative systematic strategies]] to capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. The primary focus for managers employing this method is generating returns, with diversification benefits like low correlation to other assets being a natural outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

## Evolution and History at EMC Capital Advisors
EMC Capital Advisors, a firm with deep roots in "Turtle Trading," exemplifies the evolution of this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### The Turtle Program Influence
Elizabeth Cheval, the founder of EMC Capital, was an initial participant in the "Turtle Program," a mentoring initiative run by Richard Dennis and Bill Eckhart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This program sought to determine if traders could be trained using set rules to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Brian Proctor, Managing Director at EMC Capital, also participated in a second wave of the Turtle Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. Key lessons from the program emphasized:
*   **[[risk_management_in_systematic_trading | Managing risk properly]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **[[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | Building robust systems]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Removing emotion from trading** to run programs without subjective daily decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Letting winners run** and cutting losses quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. Successful [[systematic trading systems | systems]] yield winners two to two and a half times larger than losing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

### Strategic Evolution
Initially, EMC Capital incorporated traditional breakout [[systematic trading strategies | systems]] learned from the Turtle Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Over time, the firm evolved to include different types of [[systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]] and momentum-based [[systematic trading systems | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This evolution included:
*   Overhauling trading [[systematic trading systems | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   Adjusting leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
*   Implementing new [[risk_management_in_systematic_trading | risk management protocols]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
This shift was partly driven by changes in investor appetite, moving from a desire for higher returns and volatility (when risk-free rates were high) to programs with smoother return streams and lower drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>.

## Application of Systematic Strategies

### Diversified System Blends
EMC Capital's programs blend [[systematic trading systems | systems]] based on two core concepts:
1.  **[[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | Trend following]]** (or range-dependent systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:29:00">[32:29:00]</a>. These systems confirm the current price over long, medium, and short-term lookbacks to identify an established trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a>.
2.  **Momentum systems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>. These focus on time-weighted analysis of recent daily data, looking for emerging trends based on positive closes or the speed and magnitude of price acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.

These systems are diversified to initiate and liquidate trades at different time frames and market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. While the longest-term [[systematic trading systems | systems]] often have the highest absolute returns, blending them with shorter-term systems helps improve risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharp and Sortino ratios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>. Each system generally carries an equal risk weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>.

### Parameters and Volatility Filters
The core logic for their [[systematic trading systems | systems]] remains set, but parameter sets evolve based on new data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. Parameters determine how positions are initiated and liquidated, including a max loss for each trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>.
Crucially, systems include parameters that block trades in certain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>. Volatility filters, based on historical volatility (often a short look-back of a couple of weeks), prevent trading in highly volatile markets where losses are more frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. However, filters are varied across systems to ensure at least some systems remain active during volatile periods, avoiding missed trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

### Holding Periods
EMC Capital's systems have an average holding period of 35 to 45 days, placing them in the medium-term [[systematic investing and trend following | trend follower]] category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Some systems hold for as short as 15 days, while others can extend to 100 days or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

### Adaptive Processes
The firm employs an adaptive process for parameter selection, staggering the re-optimization of [[systematic trading systems | systems]] on a yearly basis across different quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. This systematic re-optimization, coupled with "forward walk" (out-of-sample) testing, ensures reliability and reproducibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>. Consistency between hypothetical out-of-sample and real-time trading results is a key indicator of a reliable system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08:00">[43:08:00]</a>.

## [[Risk management in systematic trading | Risk Management]]
[[Risk management in systematic trading | Risk management]] is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>. It is managed at every level of the investment program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:57:00">[50:57:00]</a>:
*   **System Level**: Each [[systematic trading systems | system]] has a max loss for every trade, and different systems have varying thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:00">[51:06:00]</a>.
*   **Market Level**: A limited amount of risk can be taken in any one market at initiation, with positions sized based on current volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:35:00">[51:35:00]</a>. Higher volatility leads to smaller position sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:25:00">[52:25:28]</a>.
*   **Sector Level**: Max risk is limited per sector, e.g., the energy sector might have a 10-11% allocation of total portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:14:00">[53:14:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Level (Profit-based Scaling)**: A unique algorithm adjusts positions when open trade equity and profitability reach certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>. This "marginal utility" concept aims to lock in profits and reduce exposure during highly profitable, often volatile, periods, preventing large drawdowns from trend reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>. This mechanism can reduce positions by up to 60-75% in aggressive scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:53:00">[55:53:00]</a>. This proactive scaling differentiates them from peers, potentially leading to underperformance in explosive periods but outperformance during reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32:00">[56:32:00]</a>.

## Market Selection
When considering new markets, several factors are assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>:
*   **Liquidity**: Ensuring sufficient liquidity for the firm's Assets Under Management (AUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:37:00">[46:37:00]</a>. Less liquid markets (e.g., lumber, orange juice, oats) receive lower risk weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:58:00">[46:58:00]</a>.
*   **Correlation**: Assessing the market's correlation to existing sectors to maintain diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance**: Evaluating how well the firm's [[systematic trading systems | trading systems]] perform historically in that market, especially its trending behavior (linear vs. choppy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>. Markets with more linear trends may receive higher weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:45:00">[49:45:00]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Misconceptions
Markets today are generally more liquid than in the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:58:00">[57:58:00]</a>. Information flow is much quicker, causing markets to react faster to news, which can lead to rapid cascades of liquidation orders when many participants are positioned incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:02:00">[58:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>. This necessitates nimble [[risk_management_in_systematic_trading | risk management]] and the use of shorter-term [[systematic trading systems | systems]] to liquidate positions quickly during steep reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:09:00">[59:09:00]</a>.

### Common Misconceptions
Despite its proven benefits, misconceptions persist about [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]], particularly [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]]:
*   **"All CTAs do the same thing."** This is incorrect, as nuances in strategy, [[systematic trading systems | system]] blends, and [[risk_management_in_systematic_trading | risk management]] differentiate managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
*   **"[[Systematic investing and trend following | Trend following]] is dead or doesn't work."** This belief is frustrating given the long-term positive returns and diversification benefits it provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   **"It's simple, just flip a moving average."** This underestimates the extensive research, testing, and continuous adaptation required to build robust and reliable [[systematic trading systems | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:08">[01:02:08]</a>.

It is very difficult to find a trend reversal system that works, prompting the development of algorithms that scale back positions rather than allocating more capital to counter-trend trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>. This continuous process of improvement is key for firms like EMC Capital Advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>.

Looking ahead, the current environment of uncertainty (e.g., inflation, global debt issues) reinforces the value of having a portfolio component that trades unique commodity markets and interest rates, with the ability to take short positions in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. The [[systematic_macro_trading_approach | quantitative approach]] provides confidence and helps manage outlier risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>.

EMC Capital Advisors, a firm led by Brian Proctor, has a deep connection to [[The Turtle Trading Program]]. Elizabeth Cheval, who founded EMC Capital in 1988, was one of the initial participants in the program. Brian Proctor himself joined the second wave of Turtles and traded for Richard Dennis before joining EMC Capital in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## The Turtle Trading Program and its Foundation
[[The Turtle Trading Program]] was a mentoring initiative run by Richard Dennis and his partner Bill Eckhart. Their primary objective was to determine if they could train traders to become profitable using set rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Key lessons imparted by Dennis and Eckhart, which remain influential at EMC Capital, included the importance of managing risk, building robust systems, and removing emotion from trading to run programs without subjective daily decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Richard Dennis and Bill Eckhart were "very adamant" that proper risk management is crucial for a trader's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

A core principle taught was to "cut your losses quickly and let your winners... evolve and run over time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Bill Eckhart notably disagreed with the adage "you never get broke taking profits," emphasizing the importance of letting winners run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. For good systems, winners are expected to be two to two and a half times larger than losing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategy at EMC Capital
The strategy at EMC Capital has evolved considerably since its early days. In the beginning, Liz Cheval incorporated the more traditional breakout systems she learned from [[The Turtle Trading Program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Over the next decade, through the late 1990s, the firm diversified its approach to include different types of [[Trend following strategy and its evolution]] and momentum-based systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Significant overhauls included not only the trading systems but also the amount of leverage used and the [[Turtle Trading philosophy and risk management]] protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. The industry transitioned from a period of high risk-free rates, where targeted returns and volatility were geared to be three times the risk-free rate, to a lower-appetite environment. This shift necessitated an evolution in strategy, leading to a reduction in risk exposure compared to the late 1980s and early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Current Investment Philosophy and Strategy
EMC Capital's investment philosophy has remained consistent:
> "All the relevant market information is reflected in the price of whatever Market we're looking at and that quantitative analysis is the most effective method to identify predictable print Trends in price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

Historical data demonstrates that markets consistently trend, offering identifiable and repeatable profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. The firm's objective is to develop and implement quantitative, systematic strategies that deliver long-term positive returns with low correlation to other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. All models are built and re-optimized to capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

Key differentiators from other CTAs include:
*   **Significant Commodity Allocation** - Approximately 45-50% of risk is allocated across commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   **Blend of Systems** - Programs utilize two core concepts: [[Trend following strategy and its evolution]] (range-dependent) and momentum systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. These systems are diversified to initiate and liquidate positions at different time frames and under varying market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
*   **Medium-Term Holding Period** - The average holding period for their systems is 35-45 days, positioning them as a medium-term rather than a long-term trend follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. While long-term systems yield higher absolute returns with bigger drawdowns, EMC prefers a blend to improve Sharpe/Sortino ratios and create a more palatable return stream for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.
*   **Long Bias** - Historically, long-sided trades have been the most profitable. The firm adds a slight bias to long positions, making them a "little bit bigger" than short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:22:00">[21:22:00]</a>.

## Research and Enhancements
EMC Capital focuses on evolving the parameter sets of its trading systems over time, while the core logic remains largely consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>. These parameter sets dictate how positions are initiated, liquidated, and how trades are blocked in certain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:54:00">[24:54:00]</a>.

### Volatility Filters
Each system incorporates volatility filters to prevent trading in highly volatile market environments (e.g., when volatility is in the top 15% looking back over a period). Research indicates that trading in such conditions often leads to losers and hitting hard stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>. These filters vary by system, ensuring that at least one or two systems remain active even during volatile periods to avoid missing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>.

### Range-Dependent Systems
Each system also has a "range-dependent system" or "open range filter," requiring the market to be moving in a specific direction for initiation or liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. Volatility is determined using a very short look-back window (e.g., couple of weeks) to ensure reactivity to recent market changes. This short look-back window, which influences trade sizing, is a distinctive feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:56:00">[27:56:00]</a>.

### Trend Following vs. Momentum Systems
Both [[Trend following strategy and its evolution]] and momentum systems aim to capture directional price movement:
*   **Trend Following Systems** confirm current price trends over multiple discrete time frames (e.g., 180-day, 40-day, 15-day look-backs). Different liquidation criteria differentiate holding periods, with some being quicker to re-initiate trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>.
*   **Momentum Systems** employ a time-weighted analysis of the most recent daily data (e.g., last two-three weeks). One type identifies emerging trends by analyzing closing prices (more positive closes indicate an emerging trend). Another focuses on the speed and magnitude of day-to-day price action, kicking in when volatility increases and prices accelerate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>.

These diversified approaches for initiating and liquidating trades ensure varied entry and exit points. Each system carries an equal risk weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

### Adaptive Process and Core Logic
EMC Capital utilizes an adaptive process for parameter selection, re-optimizing systems on a yearly, staggered basis (e.g., one system per quarter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>. This contrasts with firms that make wholesale changes annually. They use a "forward walk" or "out-of-sample" testing methodology to ensure systems are reliable and reproducible, comparing actual trading results to hypothetical out-of-sample performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:36:00">[42:36:00]</a>.

The "technical logic" or "core logic" refers to the fitness metric used for system optimization. This involves changing the performance metrics (e.g., blending return with a risk-adjusted element like Sortino ratio, or concepts like efficiency â€“ how much of a trend is captured). Changing this core logic can alter a system's return profile and how it blends within the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:02:00">[38:02:00]</a>.

## Market Selection and Liquidity
The firm currently trades around 70+ markets globally, with plans to add more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:17:00">[46:17:00]</a>. Factors considered when adding markets include:
*   **Liquidity** - Ensuring sufficient liquidity for the AUM traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Weighting** - Markets are assigned risk weightings based on liquidity, from fully weighted (1.0) to less liquid (0.1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:49:00">[46:49:00]</a>. Less liquid markets like Lumber or Orange Juice are retained due to their potential for significant trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:00">[47:14:00]</a>.
*   **Correlation** - Assessing the correlation of a new market to its sector (e.g., iron ore to base metals) to adjust overall sector risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:01:00">[48:01:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Return Stream** - Evaluating how well existing trading systems perform in that market historically. Markets with more linear, less choppy trends are favored and may receive higher weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:01:00">[49:01:00]</a>.

Markets today are generally more liquid than in the 1980s and 1990s, but information flow is much quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:58:00">[57:58:00]</a>. Markets tend to react faster to news, which can lead to rapid cascades of liquidation orders when many participants are positioned incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:35:00">[58:35:00]</a>. This emphasizes the need for nimble, shorter-term systems to manage steep trend reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:09:00">[59:09:00]</a>.

## Risk Management Philosophy
Risk management is considered the most important aspect of a CTA's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38:00">[50:38:00]</a>. EMC Capital manages risk at every level of the investment program:
*   **System Level**: Each system has a maximum loss limit for every trade, and different systems have varying thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:00">[51:06:00]</a>.
*   **Market Level**: Each market has a limited amount of risk it can take at initiation. More aggressive, higher-risk markets might risk half of one percent per trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:37:00">[51:37:00]</a>.
*   **Volatility-Based Sizing**: Position sizes are adjusted based on market volatility, with smaller positions taken when volatility increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>.
*   **Sector Level**: Max risk is limited per sector (e.g., 10-11% for the energy sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Level (Utility/Marginal Utility)**: A significant departure from traditional approaches is the portfolio-level scaling mechanism introduced in the late 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:11:00">[56:11:00]</a>. This algorithm takes into account open trade equity and unliquidated profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. When profit thresholds are met, or after a certain time, the algorithm gradually scales back positions to lock in profits and align risk with current volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>. This is based on the concept of marginal utility, where an investor's satisfaction from additional gains decreases at higher profit levels, making preservation of gains more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:18:00">[54:18:00]</a>. While this may lead to underperformance during explosive periods by sacrificing some upside, it generally leads to outperformance during reversal periods by mitigating drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:25:00">[56:25:00]</a>.

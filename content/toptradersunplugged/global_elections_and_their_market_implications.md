Alan Dun, sitting in for Neils Larsen on Top Traders Unplugged, is joined by Cham Chim to discuss pressing macro topics, particularly the impact of global elections on markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Current Market Environment and Underlying Structure

Cham notes that the current market narrative is heavily influenced by the election season, making it a key focus for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A significant observation is the "record dispersion" in the market, with constituent volatility being four times higher than index volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This phenomenon has broken down the "breadth signal" that many models rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

The counterintuitive effect occurs because the index is often "pinned" due to high structured product issuance and vol supply at the index level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This forces individual constituents to exhibit higher volatility to maintain overall market balance, as idiosyncratic risks (like earnings surprises) still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Record low correlations and record high dispersion are a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

While this market structure creates fragility, especially if speculative items like certain AI names were to break down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, it doesn't necessarily mean an immediate market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In fact, index vol supply can make it very hard for the market to break down quickly, as seen in 2017, where there was no pullback greater than 50 basis points for almost two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The increase in structured product issuance by banks, driven by investors seeking better value propositions given high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and the magnifying effect of zero-days-to-expiry (0DTE) option trading, contribute to this "pinning action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This dynamic, while profitable for vol sellers in the short term, can lead to a "Volmageddon" event if it breaks, similar to what happened at the end of 2017 with XIV's implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### The Role of Nvidia and Broader Market Fragility
Nvidia's dramatic performance is largely attributed to the AI narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. However, two years ago, Nvidia's stock was struggling due to fears of a potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Despite the current focus on AI, the geopolitical risk of Taiwan remains significant, with a 50/50 chance of something happening in the next two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. If Nvidia, now the world's largest company, were to be at the epicenter of a negative outcome from such an event, it could act as a "weapon of mass destruction" for Western economies, potentially leading to a 30% market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

This highlights how market breadth and concentration, even if not immediate trading signals, indicate long-term fragility for the broad market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The market structure, with negative gamma in individual names (from call speculation, as seen in "meme stocks" like GME and past Tesla rallies) and positive gamma on the index, naturally pushes these concentrated names higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### The Wealth Effect and Market-Led Economy
The market has become a more important leading indicator for the economy than vice versa, largely due to the "wealth effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. With global equities valued at approximately $100 trillion and other assets tied to equities possibly reaching $300 trillion, a 25% increase this year generates $75 trillion in new asset value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:27:10]</a>. This massive increase in collateral acts as a significant stimulus, essentially increasing money supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This means monitoring short-term market flows is crucial for understanding the big picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

## Global Political Landscape and Its Market Implications

The current global political landscape is characterized by rising populism, particularly driven by the millennial generation and younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. This populism stems from economic dissatisfaction, such as the inability to afford homes due to asset inflation, which itself was a function of past Federal Reserve policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. This populist rhetoric has, in turn, driven inflation, creating a reflexive cycle that is hard to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. The demand for political change is dramatic, making it difficult for incumbents to retain power, as evidenced by recent elections in the UK and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

### [[us_election_dynamics_and_economic_ramifications | US Election Dynamics]]
The US election is a major factor this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. While the outcome for the presidency appears increasingly likely to be a Trump victory, the market reaction might be counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. Historically, a "populist push" like the one seen from 1964 to 1982, marked by programs like the Great Society and protectionism, often led to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

Trump's rhetoric leans towards protectionism, with talk of high tariffs and low US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. However, similar to Nixon's opening of China, Trump might be the only one politically capable of making a deal with China, leading to outcomes that are not immediately obvious from his initial bombastic statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>.

Regarding potential replacements for Biden, it is likely too late for a significant change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:53">[00:41:53]</a>. The structural obstacles include the substantial campaign funds Biden has raised, which can only legally be transferred to his Vice President, Kamala Harris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>. Given Harris's unpopularity and the need to maintain the Democratic party's base of women and African-Americans, replacing her would be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

Market participants have been burned by past elections where high volatility was a buy, making them unwilling to sell volatility around this election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. The market expects increased volatility, potentially due to the contested nature of the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>. However, this volatility might be mean-reverting, with the market largely going nowhere over a medium-term period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

A Trump presidency could lead to higher market volatility, rising gold prices, and a steeper yield curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>. The expectation is for a "hot economy" driven by activist monetary policy, potentially leading to a change in Federal Reserve leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>. A yield steepener (short-term rates lower, long-term rates higher, inflation higher) is seen as a good proactive trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:56">[00:47:56]</a>.

### European Elections
Recent elections in the UK and upcoming second-round elections in France are also part of the broader populist shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a>. While the French elections may present a short-term trading opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>, Europe, in general, is seen as a potential catch-up trade towards the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. The resolution of Europe's energy issues due to cheap LNG and the potential for manufacturing growth in Germany are positive factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. A dip in French equities, like BNP, could represent a good entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

Despite similar structured product issuance in Europe, the US remains the epicenter of the market dynamics, as many products are tied to the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. However, in a market wobble or decline, entities outside the US, like Europe, could outperform the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.

## Outlook and Investment Strategies

Cham anticipates a "wobble" in the market starting mid-August, potentially around August 14th (VIX Opex), and continuing into September's quarterly options expiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>. This period carries increased risk due to worse vol supply and potential catalysts like the Japanese Yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. Longer-dated volatility (30-90 days out) is expected to rise, suggesting that buying calendars (buying longer-dated vol and selling shorter-dated vol) could be a good trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Initially, an increase in volatility might happen on the upside, leading to a faster, less steady market rally or a "mini blowoff top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>. This would serve as a "warning shot," increasing broad market volatility and potentially leading to a real pullback (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. However, this decline is seen as a "buyable dip" that could lead to a significant year-end rally, characterized by "market up, vol up" dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. This final rally could be the ultimate "blowoff top," making the market more unstable and leading to potential "second-move fireworks" early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

### Gold as a Long-Term Play
The long-term trade in gold for the next decade is **long-dated calls** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. This is based on a bullish view of gold and an expectation of increasing volatility in structurally inflationary and protectionist times, similar to the 1968-1982 period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. Assets that historically show dramatically increased volatility in such periods include bonds, FX, gold, and the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:50">[00:56:50]</a>.

The unsustainable level of US debt suggests a high likelihood of a "soft default" through actions like the Federal Reserve buying all the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>. While this may initially cause dollar weakness, the ultimate beneficiary is gold, which will see a very volatile outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:22">[00:58:22]</a>. Investors should hold these long-dated calls, but trade around them by selling short-dated strangles after dramatic volatile moves to fund the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>. Gold is currently in a clear channel, having bounced off the bottom end, and is entering a period with interesting election outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. The increase in US equity volatility is also likely to benefit gold volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

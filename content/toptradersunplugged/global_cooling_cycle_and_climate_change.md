Analyst Simon Hunt presents a contrarian view on [[climate_change_and_its_economic_implications | climate change]], asserting that the world is moving into a new cooling cycle rather than continued warming. This perspective has significant implications for global policy, energy, and food prices.

## Transition to a Cooling Cycle

According to Simon Hunt, based on information from NOAA, the planet is expected to transition from a warming cycle to a cooling cycle as soon as 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. NOAA has even stated that we are heading into a "full-blown cold cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This shift raises questions about the long-term viability and rationale for widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy sources, especially if weather patterns naturally cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Understanding Climate Cycles

Hunt emphasizes the importance of [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | cycles]] in his analytical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. He highlights that climate operates in long-term cycles, typically ranging from 40 to 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. These cycles are influenced by various natural phenomena, including:
*   Sunspot activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>
*   Volcanic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>
*   Changes in ocean temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>

The current period is described as moving out of approximately 40 years of warming weather and into a 40 to 70-year phase of cooling weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This cooling process allows oceans to absorb excess CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. A blog post from NOAA and NASA in September 2020, which has since been withdrawn, reportedly staged "very clearly" that a move into a cooling cycle would occur as soon as 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Impact on Food and Inflation

A cooling cycle has significant implications, particularly for food production and inflation. Longer growing seasons facilitated by slightly warmer weather over the past 20 years have helped meet global demand for grains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. A shift to a cooling period could lead to substantially higher food prices and contribute to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Drought Cycles and Food Prices

The current global economic situation is also affected by drought conditions across many parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. While not attributed to "global warming" by Hunt, these droughts, such as those caused by an underwater volcano eruption at Tonga, have led to extreme temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Furthermore, the 90-year "Gleissberg cycle," which in the 1930s caused the decade-long Dust Bowl in the agricultural Midwest, is expected to impact the world by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. This drought cycle, combined with other factors like disruptions in fertilizer and grain exports from Russia and Ukraine, is projected to cause "extreme increases in food prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

Simon Hunt cites FAO food price index figures to illustrate this trend:
*   **2019 Average:** 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>
*   **Last Year:** 126 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>
*   **Year-to-Date (Current Year):** 147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>
*   **Projected 2024:** 185 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>
*   **Projected 2025:** 220 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>

These soaring food prices are anticipated to lead to a significant increase in poverty globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Financial Implications

The convergence of these [[global_macroeconomic_cycles_and_their_influence_on_financial_markets | cycles]], combined with geopolitical tensions, is predicted to lead to a "depression" akin to the 1929-1932 era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This outlook is part of a broader view on the [[global_economic_outlook_and_recession_risks | global economic outlook and recession risks]].

### Energy and Commodity Prices
Contrary to the idea of a [[commodity_super_cycles | commodity super cycle]], Hunt views the current trends as a "normal business cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. However, he expects significant price increases in energy and food over the next two years, driven by a "resurgence of [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

**Oil Price Projections:**
*   **2022 Average:** $107 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>
*   **2023 Average:** $130 (due to modest world recovery and supply disruptions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>
*   **2024 Average:** $170 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>

**Copper Price Projections:**
*   **Short-term:** Bear market rally to $8,700 before year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
*   **Q1 Next Year:** Drop to $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.
*   **Peak (before end of 2024):** Around $14,000 (driven by inflation, falling dollar, consumption recovery, inventory replenishment, and financial hedging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.
*   **Post-2024:** Prices are expected to "completely collapse" as the world enters a depression era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>.

## Concerns and Outlook

Simon Hunt expresses deep concern about the "dangerous" financial state of the world and "warmongering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>. He views the attempts by groups like the "Davos crowd" to reshape the world as a significant worry, believing they may have influenced governments but not the general populace, who are beginning to "rebel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. He concludes that these efforts will ultimately fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

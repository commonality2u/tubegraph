[[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] and [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures]] were highlighted as the investment strategies that outperformed others in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## EMC Capital Advisors' History and Evolution
EMC Capital Advisors was founded in 1988 by Elizabeth Cheval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Cheval was an initial participant in the "Turtle program," a mentoring initiative led by Rich Dennis and Bill Eckhart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The program aimed to train traders using set rules to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Brian Proctor, the managing director at EMC Capital Advisors, also participated in the second wave of the Turtle program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Key lessons from the Turtle program, integral to EMC Capital Advisors' philosophy, include:
*   The importance of managing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Building robust systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Removing emotion from trading to run programs without subjective daily decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The strategy at EMC Capital Advisors has evolved considerably since its early days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Initially, it incorporated traditional breakout systems learned from the Turtle program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Over the next decade, the firm incorporated different types of [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | trend following]] and momentum-based systems, moving away from buying and selling around breakout points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This overhaul included not only trading systems but also the amount of leverage used and risk management protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This evolution was partly driven by the changing appetite of investors for programs with lower targeted returns and volatility, as the risk-free rate decreased from its high levels when [[managed_futures_industry | CTAs]] first started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Strategy
EMC Capital Advisors' investment philosophy remains rooted in the belief that all relevant market information is reflected in price, and quantitative analysis is the most effective method to identify predictable price [[trend_following_strategies | trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Historical data indicates that markets consistently [[trend_following_strategies | trend]], offering identifiable and repeatable profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The objective is to develop and implement [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic quantitative strategies]] that deliver long-term positive returns with low correlation to other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. All models are continually re-optimized to capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Core Concepts and Differentiators
EMC Capital Advisors' approach is characterized by:
*   **Significant Commodity Allocation** Approximately 45% to 50% of the risk across strategies is allocated to commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Blend of Systems** Programs utilize a blend of systems based on two core concepts: [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] (or range-dependent systems) and momentum systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. These systems are diversified to initiate and liquidate at different time frames and under varying market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Medium-Term Holding Period** The average holding period for their systems is 35 to 45 days, positioning them as medium-term [[trend_following_strategies | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. While some systems hold positions for only 15 days, others may hold for 35-50 days, and a few long-term systems hold for 100 days or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Longer-term systems generally have higher absolute returns but also more deviation and bigger drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **Adaptive Parameter Sets** The core logic for their [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] and [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | momentum strategies]] remains in place, but the parameter sets evolve over time based on new data inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. This includes incorporating short look-back windows (e.g., 5-7 year Sortino numbers) to improve risk-adjusted returns and adapt to changing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
*   **Long Bias** For a long time, the firm has maintained a slight long bias in its long trades within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Historically, long trades have often been the most profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.

### Trend Following vs. Momentum Systems
Both [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] and momentum systems aim to capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **[[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] systems** confirm current prices across multiple time frames (long, medium, short-term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Liquidation criteria differentiate their holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
*   **[[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | Momentum systems]]** analyze the most recent daily data (e.g., last two to three weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. One type identifies emerging [[trend_following_strategies | trends]] based on positive closing prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Another looks at the speed and magnitude of daily price action, kicking in when volatility increases and prices accelerate rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.
This diversification ensures varied entry and exit points for trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Each system has an equal risk weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

### Risk Management
Risk management is considered the most crucial aspect of a CTA's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. Risk is managed at every level of the investment program:
*   **Max Loss per Trade** Each system has an automatically generated maximum loss for every trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>.
*   **Limited Market Risk** Every market has a limited amount of risk it can take at initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
*   **Volatility-Based Sizing** Position sizing is determined by market volatility using a short look-back window (e.g., two weeks of open, high, low, close, and true range data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. As volatility increases, smaller position sizes are taken; in consolidated periods, more contracts are initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Sector Risk Limits** A maximum percentage of total portfolio risk is allocated to specific sectors (e.g., 10-11% for energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.
*   **Profit Scaling Algorithm** A significant departure from traditional methods is the implementation of an algorithm that scales back positions during highly profitable periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This mechanism considers open trade equity and unliquidated profits at the portfolio level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. It kicks in when profits reach certain thresholds and after [[trend_following_strategies | trends]] have matured, gradually reducing risk and locking in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. This can involve cutting positions by 60-75% in aggressive scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. While it may lead to underperformance during explosive market periods, it helps outperform during reversals by preserving gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.

### Market Selection
The firm trades around 70 active markets and is looking to add more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. Considerations for adding markets include:
*   **Liquidity** Markets must be liquid enough for the AUM being traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. Less liquid markets receive lower risk weightings (e.g., 0.1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
*   **Non-Correlation** Adding markets that offer non-correlation to existing sectors is beneficial for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance** The return stream of a particular market, when applying the firm's trading systems, is assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Markets that [[trend_following_strategies | trend]] more linearly receive higher weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.

## Role of Managed Futures in a Portfolio
[[managed_futures_as_a_diversification_tool | Managed futures]] add diversification to an investment portfolio, providing different return streams that can improve overall portfolio returns and lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. Some programs are designed with a smoother return stream, incorporating long-only elements in equities, bond holdings, and commodity holdings (e.g., a long gold holding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. These programs target a lower risk-return profile and lower drawdowns, offering a more palatable return stream for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Outlook
Markets are generally more liquid today, but the flow of information is much quicker than in the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. Markets tend to react more rapidly to news, which can lead to quick reversals and cascade liquidations if many participants are positioned incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. This emphasizes the need for nimble liquidation, especially for shorter-term systems, to mitigate drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

Looking into 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding potential inflation resurgence or global debt issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>. In such an environment, having a portfolio component that trades unique markets, commodity markets, and interest rates, and has the ability to go short equities, is valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The systematic, quantitative approach helps manage this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. There is current excitement regarding increasing volatility across different markets and sectors, and an increasing investor base looking to add [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic commodity trading strategies]] to their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions
Some common misconceptions about [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] and [[managed_futures_industry | CTAs]] include:
*   "All CTAs are doing the same thing" or that selecting a CTA is like throwing a dart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. This is incorrect, as strategies and implementations differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
*   The assertion that [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is "dead" or doesn't work, or that it's as simple as flipping a moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. Despite these claims, [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following investment strategies]] deliver long-term positive returns and diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>.
*   The idea that [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is "too volatile" for a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

The development of these strategies involves extensive work, testing, and trying numerous ideas to find what works reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. For example, finding a successful [[trend_following_strategies | trend]] reversal system proved very difficult, leading to the development of an algorithm that scales back positions instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. This highlights the ongoing, adaptive nature of the process and the importance of continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

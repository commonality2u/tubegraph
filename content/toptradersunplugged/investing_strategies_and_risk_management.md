Investing strategies and risk management are crucial for navigating complex global markets. Experts emphasize the importance of a "true Global macro mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, looking beyond just U.S. and European markets to encompass all global factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Past Performance
> All discussions about investment performance refer to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or infer future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:01">[01:04:01]</a>. There is a significant risk of financial loss with all [[Investment Strategies and Risks | investment strategies]], and investors must understand specific risks from investment managers before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

## Global Macro Framework

A current big-picture macro framework suggests the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to zero to one percent in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This is expected to be a result of the massive monetary and fiscal policy tightening in 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. The tightening will continue with tighter fiscal policy ahead of elections and a "higher for longer" fed funds rate above equilibrium until "something effectively breaks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Past banking episodes, like Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank, are considered idiosyncratic liquidity pool risk management issues, not a systemic break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. When a systemic break occurs, the Federal Reserve will likely need to cut rates "way below neutral levels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

## Cyclical vs. Secular Effects

A key distinction in macro investing is between cycles and trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **Cycles** are shorter-term fluctuations. For example, a belief that inflation will be higher over the next decade does not preclude inflation from being zero percent cyclically in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>.
*   **Trends** are long-term averages. There is a "not negligible" probability that inflation will be structurally higher (e.g., three or four percent) over the next 10 to 20 years, possibly reaching five to seven percent plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

### 1970s vs. Today's Economy
The economy of the 1970s was materially different:
*   Highly industrialized and labor-intensive, with wage growth being a significant driver of nominal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   Unions had significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   To generate the same million dollars of sales, a U.S. company today needs about one-tenth of the employees it needed in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   Strong labor force growth and productivity growth allowed for structural growth without leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   Inflationary episodes were harder to fight due to wage-price spirals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:55]</a>.

Today's economy is characterized by:
*   A more capital-intensive structure where capital beats labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   Demographics are different, with the Chinese workforce shrinking over the next 20-30 years, ending the era of cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   Technology plays a large role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

However, some argue similarities to 1965 exist, with deglobalization, resource scarcity, and protectionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. The importance of labor is rising, particularly in the services sector (75% of the economy in the US and Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. The millennial generation, forming households, will drive demand and fiscal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

## Bond Market and Volatility
The inversion of the overnight index swaps curve since March 2022 indicates long-term bond investors pricing in weaker growth and inflation due to short-term tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Term Premium
> The term premium in the bond market is non-existent, meaning investors are not compensated for taking duration risk over rolling T-bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

Bond volatility is crucial for overall [[Risk management in trading strategies | risk taking]] because fixed income is a large and systemically important part of institutional portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. High bond volatility reduces diversification properties and low volatility, limiting budget for other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:00">[25:40:00]</a>. Long-dated bond volatility did not explode even during the March banking crisis, indicating no structural inflation is priced in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>.

Historically, periods of inflation lead to significantly higher volatility in the dollar and FX in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

## Banking System and Risk
Recent banking problems are considered "grossly overdone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18:00">[35:18:00]</a>, largely due to increased global regulation since 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>. The issues were mainly liquidity crises, which central banks can fix by backstopping collateral value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.
*   Treasuries and government bonds are considered Level 1 high-quality liquid assets (HQ LA) with no liquidity haircut or capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>.
*   European banks are subject to a "supervisory outlier test" on interest rate risk, stressing all assets and liabilities, meaning they generally hedge their interest rate exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:47:00">[31:47:00]</a>.
*   However, European banks are more exposed to commercial real estate, which faces structural problems (e.g., office space vacancies) and represents a credit problem if it unfolds further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

The banking runs act as a "canary in the coal mine," indicating the lagged effects of monetary policy and unknown risks building up underneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>.

## Currency and Geopolitics
The world is becoming more bipolar, with growing alignment among Western powers and countries like Brazil questioning dollar ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.

### US Dollar
The U.S. dollar's direction during a recession depends on its shape:
*   In a recession without significant deleveraging, dollar appreciation is not a given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>. Fed policy (e.g., slashing rates) could lead to other currencies strengthening against the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>.
*   A recession with a credit deleveraging event always leads to dollar appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. The global financial system is based on dollar-denominated debt, and when trade growth comes down, entities need to deleverage to get dollars, causing the dollar to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>.

The idea of de-dollarization is challenging because the U.S. provides a large, liquid, deep, and ever-increasing market for recycling dollars (treasuries and repo market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. Other countries lack similar infrastructure (e.g., Europe's small AAA market, Japan's illiquid bond market, China/Russia's rule of law concerns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13">[01:06:13]</a>. Transitioning away from a system with $12 trillion in dollar-denominated liabilities outside the U.S. would be chaotic <a class="yt-1-07-01">[01:07:01]</a>.

> [!TIP] Investing in Volatility
> Instead of betting on dollar direction, consider buying volatility in the FX space during inflationary periods, as "vol of vol" is still cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>.

### Japanese Yen
Japan is the largest exporter of capital, with large savings that they invest internationally in U.S. treasuries, European government bonds, and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
*   During periods of uncertainty, Japanese investors, who are risk-averse, tend to reduce exposure and repatriate capital, leading to Yen strengthening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   Coupled with recent wage growth (4%) and services inflation (4%) in Japan, and a new Bank of Japan governor, there are potential idiosyncratic tailwinds for the Yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. A marginal change in monetary policy away from yield curve control could lead to higher domestic interest rates, making repatriation more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>.

### Carry Trades
Carry trades (e.g., in Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso, Polish Zloty, Hungarian Forint) have gained popularity due to embedded carry and low realized volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. However, investors should be cautious as this might be getting "a bit extreme" and rooted in the mindset that nothing can go wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Historical Emerging Market crises (e.g., 1996-1999) show that such pressures can build before things break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.

## Commodities
In an environment where the Fed's dual mandate is in conflict due to inflation, other entities (like OPEC) are able to "flex their muscles" and influence markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. These resource conflicts are connected to broader global conflicts and populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>.

Commodity prices are expected to be underpinned by the actions of these entities, potentially reducing industrial commodity volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>. Commodities, especially industrial commodities, deserve a more important role in macro portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:16">[01:12:16]</a> as they perform well when inflation volatility is high, particularly when inflation is rapidly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:10">[01:12:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Systematic Investing
> [[Systematic investing strategies | CTA Trend following diversifiers]] also perform very well in high volatile commodity environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

## Opportunities in a Changing World
The global stage is changing rapidly, with China taking center stage and increased geopolitical activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>. This points to a world becoming more bipolar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. Investors need to expand their horizons beyond just U.S. and European markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>.

Populism, which is demographically tied to younger generations and driven by fiscal policy, is inherently local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>. Monetary policy drives money to international capital, correlated with globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>. The shift from monetary to fiscal policy and from capitalism to populism creates "immense and asymmetric opportunities" that are likely to last for a decade or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>.

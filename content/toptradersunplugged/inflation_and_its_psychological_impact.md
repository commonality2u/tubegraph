Inflation is understood not merely as an economic phenomenon, but fundamentally as a psychological one, deeply tied to feelings of scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. The current period of unexpected [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] has intensified feelings of vulnerability and uncertainty, particularly for lower-end consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

## Impact on Confidence and Decision-Making

### Erosion of Predictability and Certainty
Unexpected [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]], like the 40-year high seen in the US, creates significant cognitive and emotional stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Wildly swinging [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] rates destroy predictability, a critical component for confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. People dislike environments of control without certainty, which can feel like gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.

The waning confidence in central bankers, such as the Federal Reserve, is directly linked to rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Historically, during periods of spiking interest rates in the late 1970s, confidence in central banks evaporated as they struggled to control [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### The "Mark to Market" Economy
Today's economy is characterized as a "mark to market" economy where investors can speculate on essential goods like gas and food, further influencing their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>. This creates an environment prone to significant price spikes and collapses, which can lead to unexpected and violent price shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. This phenomenon, likened to the "lumber phenomenon," shows how the collective mood can rapidly drive prices in one direction, only for them to reverse dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.

## Policy Implications and Future Outlook

### Policymaker Hesitation
Given the current [[inflationary_pressures_and_macroeconomic_policy | inflationary pressures and macroeconomic policy]], policymakers are expected to be more reticent in over-responding to the next crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:44">[00:37:44]</a>. The peak of using fiscal and monetary stimulus to address economic issues is likely behind us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

### Populism and Inequality
Populism is driven by fiscal policy, which in turn fuels [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. This creates a feedback loop where [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] further intensifies populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The underlying issue is inequality, which monetary policy has exacerbated by favoring those who can borrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. While populism drives fiscal policy to address inequality, this also tends to lead to more price controls and reduced liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

### Long-Term Inflation Expectations
Long-term [[factors_influencing_inflation_and_economic_forecasts | inflation]] expectations are considered the worst possible outcome for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. If people expect sustained high [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]], they bring investment forward, buying things now before prices rise further. Additionally, if interest rates are lower than [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] expectations, it incentivizes borrowing and increased spending, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:46">[00:43:46]</a>. To counter this, central banks may deliberately try to create volatility in interest rate expectations to prevent the anchoring of high long-term [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>.

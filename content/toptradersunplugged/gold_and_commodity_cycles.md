Mahendra Sharma, founder of MahendraProphecy Publications, employs a unique approach to market prediction, utilizing astro-cycles and planetary movements to forecast trends across various asset classes, including gold and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. His methodology involves studying historical market movements in relation to celestial alignments to identify recurring patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. He emphasizes that while interpretations of these charts can vary between individuals, the underlying planetary movements remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Mahendra's Background in Market Prediction
Mahendra's journey into financial astrology began after realizing he wanted to use his predictive abilities to help people financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>. His first major prediction in 1995-1996 involved a "huge technological bubble" which led him to recommend investing in technology, software, and internet stocks, from which he and others made a fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. He was also fortunate to predict the crash of technology and internet stocks in early 2000, advising people to exit their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### The Rise of Commodities (2001 Onwards)
In his 2001 book, Mahendra declared the beginning of the [[commodities_role_in_economic_cycles_and_investment_strategies | commodity era]] and the "era of fall of dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This prediction gained significant attention, with mentions from Bill Murphy of GATA, especially concerning gold forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He specifically predicted gold reaching $1800 and silver hitting $50 during 2001-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This marked a shift in his focus towards market trends to enable the masses to make money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## [[gold_market_dynamics | Gold Market Dynamics]] and Long-Term Cycles
Mahendra employs a "wave of nature" theory to understand how planetary movements influence collective human behavior, leading to market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. For instance, when the astrological chart for gold is positive, people are naturally drawn to it, creating a wave of interest and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

### Recent Gold Predictions
In 2019, he predicted gold would bottom out in February-March and move towards $2000 by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. By May-June 2020, he anticipated gold reaching $2075 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>. Looking ahead to 2021, his prediction was for gold to bottom around $1840 and then rise to $2375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. For silver, the target was $38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

### Gold's 52-Year Cycle and Future Role
As far back as 2001, Mahendra identified a 52-year [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | gold cycle]], predicting that the current bullish cycle would persist until 2051 and conclude in 2052 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. Following 2052, he believes gold could become irrelevant or, conversely, government policies might necessitate its surrender or even lead to gold becoming a currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. He notes that a "very interesting era for the gold" will begin around 2028, where gold could play a more significant role than even cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.

## [[commodities_role_in_economic_cycles_and_investment_strategies | Commodities Role in Economic Cycles and Investment Strategies]]
Mahendra's [[overview_of_past_and_present_commodity_markets | overview of past and present commodity markets]] suggests varying performances across sectors. In 2020, he observed a negative view on the energy market, leading to its underperformance compared to other commodities, while metals performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

### 2021 Commodity Outlook
For 2021, he anticipates:
*   **Grains** will outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
*   **Metals** will perform well but with high volatility, requiring traders to book profits on sharp rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   **Energy market** is expected to remain sluggish, with oil struggling to cross $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>.
*   **Soft commodities**, especially coffee and cocoa, are recommended buys for traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.
*   **Soybean and wheat** are also recommended due to potential weather issues in Australia and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

He emphasizes that those looking to invest should focus on the medium to longer term to create wealth, rather than speculating on short-term movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

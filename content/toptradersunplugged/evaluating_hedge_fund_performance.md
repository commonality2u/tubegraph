When evaluating hedge fund performance, it is crucial for investors to remember that past performance does not guarantee or even infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A significant risk of financial loss exists with all investment strategies, and investors must request and understand the specific risks from an investment manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding how investors perceive skill and Alpha in large hedge funds today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Often, what is perceived as skill or Alpha may not be genuine, with some managers exhibiting "style drift" by changing their strategy over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. This can lead to an increased correlation between supposedly alternative strategies and traditional asset classes, which are designed to protect investors during market troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:16">[01:18:16]</a>.

## Replicability of CTA Industry Returns

The CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) industry's returns can be replicated with a simple model, such as a 10-day to 100-day simple moving average crossover strategy, applied equally to four sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a>. This basic strategy can achieve a 70% correlation to the CTA industry and outperform by 3% to 5% annually due to lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Approximately 90% of CTA returns are easily replicable, making it apparent that what was once viewed as a pool of skill-based returns is now largely attributable to accessible techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>.

Investors need to go beyond surface-level analysis and understand the sub-factors that can significantly affect CTA returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>. These sub-factors, often risk-on strategies correlated to equity markets, can differentiate a manager's performance without necessarily indicating superior skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.

## Factors Masking True Skill in Hedge Funds

Several factors contribute to perceived Alpha that may not be a result of skill, often improving a fund's Sharpe ratio significantly:

*   **Sector Optimization**: CTAs have increasingly allocated to fixed income due to its strong performance over the last 20 years and its liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:34">[01:21:34]</a>. Increased allocation to fixed income can improve a basic model's Sharpe ratio by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:18">[01:22:18]</a>. Fixed income also tends to be negatively correlated to stocks, providing substantial returns to CTAs during equity corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:36">[01:22:36]</a>.
*   **Long vs. Short Biases**: Over 90% of returns for a basic CTA strategy have historically come from the long side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:10">[01:23:10]</a>. Trading only long positions could improve a Sharpe ratio by 80% over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:08">[01:24:08]</a>. Larger CTAs, facing higher transaction costs, may naturally reduce short trading and focus on longs, unintentionally enhancing their Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>.
*   **Time Frame Adjustments**: CTAs have gradually increased the time frames used for their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:10">[01:25:10]</a>. For example, moving from 10-day/40-day moving averages to 10-day/500-day moving averages, which is much more long-term, can significantly improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. The 10-day/500-day equity curve has remained strong even when other CTA models have flatlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>. Optimizing a portfolio with this longer time frame could improve the Sharpe ratio by 70%, potentially elevating a manager to "superstar" status without actual skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:39">[01:26:39]</a>.
*   **Mean Reversion Strategies**: CTAs typically profit from trends, especially during volatility expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:18">[01:27:18]</a>. However, some have adopted strategies like mean reversion, which involves taking profits faster and buying corrections within trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:21">[01:28:21]</a>. This approach improves the Sharpe ratio but can make a fund less capable of benefiting from volatility expansions, sacrificing positive skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:32">[01:31:32]</a>. For instance, a simple model that buys the S&P if it's down three days in a row can yield a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 over 15 years, even performing well during periods like 2007-2008, largely due to central bank liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:23">[01:33:23]</a>. Such strategies can improve the Sharpe ratio of a typical trend-following model by 130% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>.
*   **Fixed Long Equity Exposure**: Some large CTAs (the "btop" â€” top 50% controlling 50% of assets) exhibit a fixed long position in equities, with a 70% rolling correlation to the S&P when their trend-following component is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. Adding a fixed long S&P position could improve a Sharpe ratio by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:35">[01:35:35]</a>.
*   **Shorting the VIX (Volatility Index)**: This strategy, akin to being short puts on the market, can improve a Sharpe ratio by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   **Carry Models & Credit Strategies**: Typical carry models can improve Sharpe ratios by 18% when optimized, while adding credit-type strategies (e.g., exposure to credit swaps) can boost it by about 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>.

These seven factors are not skill-based but are highly correlated to the largest CTAs, indicating a shift towards strategies that reduce the ability of CTAs to hedge equity corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:40">[01:36:40]</a>. Fund managers might introduce these strategies to compensate for increased size or to introduce more stability into returns, as they have performed well, particularly in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:28">[01:38:28]</a>.

### Alpha vs. Skill

Most hedge funds and CTAs today generate numerical Alpha to their benchmarks, but this Alpha is often due to taking on more tail risk rather than true skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:54">[01:44:54]</a>. CTAs, for instance, convert positive skew for negative skew in exchange for a higher Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:18">[01:45:18]</a>. Therefore, Alpha does not always equate to skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:26">[01:45:26]</a>. Investors must be aware of these non-skill-based factors when conducting [[importance_of_track_record_in_evaluating_hedge_funds | manager due diligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:39">[01:34:39]</a>.

## Quest Partners' Approach to Performance and Risk

Quest Partners, founded by Nicole Kagan, differentiates itself by focusing on a clear philosophy that seeks positively skewed sources of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. This means avoiding strategies that involve mean reversion or are exposed to risk-on trades like bottom-picking equities, allocating more to fixed income, going long equities, shorting VIX, or engaging in carry and credit spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:04">[01:52:04]</a>.

### Volatility as a Primary Driver

For Quest Partners, volatility is more important than price in identifying trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:40">[01:57:40]</a>. They look for volatility compression and expect a subsequent expansion, especially when markets are pushed far from equilibrium with low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29">[01:55:29]</a>. This approach allows them to generate returns even in low-volatility environments by capitalizing on "spikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:56">[01:55:56]</a>.

The firm's original program has maintained its philosophy of generating Alpha from positively skewed sources of returns, even as the methods for expressing this "long volatility" or "long tails" bias have evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:39">[01:53:39]</a>. These strategies are more stable when the market regime changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:20">[01:53:20]</a>.

### Strategy Implementation

Quest Partners uses shorter time frames, with an average of seven days per trade, to maximize Alpha and positive skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:57">[01:53:57]</a>. This is where the most expansion in volatility occurs and where tail events are most beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:13">[01:54:13]</a>. They measure volatility in a more complex, pattern-based way, considering differences in volatility when the market is making new lows/highs versus in the middle of a range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:23">[01:56:23]</a>.

Their models are applied consistently across all markets in the portfolio to avoid over-optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:27">[02:06:27]</a>. The firm utilizes about five different core concepts, each applied in two or more time frames, such as market skew, volatility compression, and volatility at extremes versus the middle of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>.

The models often incorporate time-constrained exits, meaning trades are exited after a certain period, regardless of performance, because the Alpha opportunity is no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:18">[01:59:18]</a>. This disciplined approach maximizes Alpha per unit of Beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:15">[02:04:15]</a>.

### Influence of Upbringing on Strategy Design

Nicole Kagan's upbringing in an unstable environment in Lebanon, where he moved to the US at 16 to escape wars, influenced his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>. This experience led him to focus on designing trading strategies that consider the instability of the world, leading to a focus on automation and detachment from emotional decisions in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:22">[01:46:22]</a>. He believes the human mind is not equipped to make ideal decisions in financial markets because it is designed to think with the crowd, whereas profitable trading often requires a contrarian approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:50">[01:46:50]</a>. Therefore, relying on models and trusting them completely, provided they are not over-optimized, allows for running diverse strategies with a relatively small team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:10">[01:47:10]</a>. This contrasts with traditional approaches that might require significant mental space for daily re-optimization. [[building_a_successful_hedge_fund_management_team | Building a successful hedge fund management team]] with this philosophy involves a clear direction and reliance on automation rather than human intuition in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>.
This focus on systematic, rule-based trading, rather than relying on gut feeling, helps manage [[challenges_and_considerations_in_hedge_fund_management | investment risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The [[use_of_technology_in_hedge_fund_management | use of technology in hedge fund management]] allows for a tight infrastructure, minimizing the need for large teams in administrative and back-office functions, as these are increasingly commoditized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.

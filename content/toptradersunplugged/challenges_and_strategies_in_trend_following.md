Systematic investing offers a raw and honest journey into the world of dependable and consistent, yet often overlooked, investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core of this approach often involves [[Trend following strategies|trend following]], which focuses on identifying and capitalizing on sustained price movements in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Current Market Environment (May 2022)

The financial markets in May 2022 present significant [[challenges of trend following|challenges]]:
*   The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index fell for the eighth consecutive week, a streak not seen since 1923 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   The S&P 500 experienced its longest losing streak since 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   Even Bitcoin saw its most consecutive weekly losses in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   These losses are attributed to a barrage of weak earnings reports, particularly from retail (Amazon, Walmart, Target), due to rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Bond markets reacted to equity weakness by pushing the yield curve below three percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   The Federal Reserve (Fed) is unlikely to "bail out" the stock market as it has in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has bought 67% of all 10-year Japanese government bonds to control yield, demonstrating extreme measures in the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Despite these conditions, it's suggested that "it doesn't have to be this way" for investors who follow [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Core Principles and Clarifications in [[Trend following strategies|Trend Following]]

### "Pyramiding" vs. Multiple Systems

A common misunderstanding in [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] is the concept of "pyramiding" when adding to positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   In the context of the "Turtle Traders" system, positions are added based on pre-defined steps as the market moves favorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
*   However, this is not true pyramiding where subsequent trades are based on prior trade outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   Instead, it involves four independent systems (e.g., 20-day, 40-day, 60-day, 80-day breakouts) that operate autonomously, each with its own entry and exit rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Each system defines its risk upfront (e.g., one unit per market, split into 25% per system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   These system trades should be executed when the system indicates, without micromanaging or considering other system trades in the same market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Jerry Parker's testing showed that trying to spread out entries for small profits underperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   Confusing multiple systems with "pyramiding" inaccurately describes [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Universal vs. Market-Specific Rules

A common question is whether it's optimal to apply the exact same rules across all liquid markets or to customize parameters for each market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Jerry Parker's View:** Sticking to universal rules across all markets (long and short) is preferred due to the paramount importance of sample size in long-term [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. There is generally insufficient data to optimize parameters for individual markets like crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. He doesn't believe markets have "personalities" that necessitate different rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Niels Kaastrup-Larsen's Alternative:** While agreeing with the simplicity for most, he suggests a hybrid approach for a total risk budget (e.g., 30 basis points per market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>:
    *   A portion (e.g., 10%) for universal parameter settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.
    *   Another portion optimized by sectors (e.g., metals vs. softs vs. stock indices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.
    *   A very small portion (smallest part of total risk budget) optimized on an individual market basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Jerry Parker's Objection:** He argues against compromising the core robustness of [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] for the sake of diversification or perceived optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. The system must be robust, safe, and positively skewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

### Managing Extreme Outliers

The question of whether to manually close a position after an extreme price drop (e.g., Luna's 95% fall) or let the system run its course is a key [[challenges of trend following|challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.
*   **Systematic Approach:** [[Trend following strategies|Trend followers]] define risk using metrics like Average True Range (ATR), focusing on volatility rather than dollar value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. They generally aim for one entry, one exit, and a stop loss for all markets, long and short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
*   **Manual Intervention:** While generally advocating for strict rules, Jerry Parker admits that infrequent, extreme outlier situations *can* warrant discretionary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. For example, exiting a short position in Russian stocks that had fallen so much that further downside to zero offered minimal additional profit compared to the risk of a bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. This is seen as more robust than daily implementations of non-robust profit-taking rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.

## What Doesn't Work in [[Trend following strategies|Trend Following]]

Insights from decades of experience reveal what to avoid:
*   **Limited Market Diversification:** Applying [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] to a small number of markets or a single sector (e.g., only equities, currencies, bonds, or commodities) will not yield the same magical diversification and smooth returns as a broad portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. While [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] can work within a single sector, the overall portfolio performance will be less smooth and consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>.
*   **Not Playing for Outliers:** Actively taking profits before the trailing stop is hit, or managing volatility to reduce exposure to large trends, is a "bad idea" because it limits the potential for massive outlier profits (e.g., 400-500 ATR profits) that are crucial for long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.
*   **Predicting Markets:** Systems that attempt to predict market direction, use relative strength, or incorporate predictive models are unlikely to work because markets are inherently unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.
*   **Over-complicating:** Simple rules, such as one entry, one exit, and a stop loss, are often the most effective. Overly complex systems tend to underperform those that maintain simplicity, especially in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Consistency, Outliers, and Risk Metrics

### Consistency in [[Trend following strategies|Trend Following]]

Contrary to intuition, classical [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] (with one entry, one exit, and a stop loss, without smoothing or vol management) can achieve surprising consistency in returns over longer periods, even while aiming for infrequent outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   By *not* trying to manage the smoothness of returns through methods like vol management or correlation management, the system may paradoxically achieve *more* consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>.
*   Chesapeake, for example, had 13 consecutive winning years in its first 13 years of operation with less sophisticated systems than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>. A backtest from 1977 showed no losing calendar years, although some winning years were only one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.
*   The consistency lies not in month-to-month smoothness but in the profile of returns, which often involves periods of no profit followed by large gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.
*   Recent years (past decade) have seen fewer long-term trends, impacting consistency for some [[Trend following strategies|CTAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

### The Power of Outliers

The immense power of outliers is a defining feature of [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.
*   A small percentage of trades (e.g., 5%) can generate the vast majority of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.
*   These outliers can be 200 to 500 ATRs (Average True Range) in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>.
*   Vol management strategies, while smoothing returns, limit these outliers, making the system dependent on broad sector movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>.
*   The philosophy of letting profits run is crucial, as outliers overwhelm the negative impact of drawdowns on compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>.

### Misleading Risk Metrics

Traditional risk metrics like the Sharpe Ratio are often misapplied to [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>.
*   The Sharpe Ratio was designed as a portfolio tool, not for individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   More importantly, it focuses on volatility over return rather than the actual risk of capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.
*   High volatility and "lumpiness" in [[Trend following strategies|CTA]] returns are often signs of allowing outliers to reach their full potential, maximizing compounded annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.
*   Historical examples like the S&P 500 or Warren Buffett's performance, which are revered for their long-term growth despite drawdowns, are rarely analyzed using Sharpe Ratios in common discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:24">[01:05:24]</a>.

## Industry Trends and the Future of [[Trend following strategies|Trend Following]]

There's a growing concern that the [[Trend following trading strategies|CTA]] industry is moving towards increased complexity, such as AI and machine learning, and away from simple [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] that allows outliers to perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.
*   This shift might compromise the industry's readiness to capture big trends during significant market dislocations like pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:56">[01:06:56]</a>.
*   The "raw" nature of [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] is often undervalued and underappreciated by investors because its simplicity makes it seem less sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.
*   Despite variations in implementation, the core philosophy of [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] is robust enough that even with minor changes, it can still deliver strong results over many years and diverse market scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   However, some argue that "volatility management" and profit-taking mechanisms "hurt the core" by not letting profits run, thereby impacting long-term compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.
*   The debate within the industry highlights different approaches to [[Challenges and Adaptations in Trend Following Strategies|trend following]], but emphasizing the "primacy of outliers" and focusing on staying in the game to allow the positively expected system to play out is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

As of Thursday's closing, the industry performance for the month of May was:
*   B-Top 50 Index: +0.63% (YTD: +15.25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:42">[01:22:42]</a>.
*   CTA Index: +0.54% (YTD: +20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:48">[01:22:48]</a>.
*   Trend Index: +0.76% (YTD: +26.75%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:52">[01:22:52]</a>.
*   Short-Term Traders Index: +0.82% (YTD: +9.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>.
*   The overall trend barometer remained strong at 61 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:06">[01:23:06]</a>.
*   In contrast, MSCI was down 5% for the month and 17.8% YTD, while the World Government Bond Index was flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:11">[01:23:11]</a>.

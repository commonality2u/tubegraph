The partnership between [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] and Man Group began when Man Group acquired 51% of [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] in 1989 [00:30:56]. The remaining part was acquired by Man Group five years later [00:42:00].

## Motivations for the Partnership

### Man Group's Perspective
Man Group already had a highly successful relationship with [[IPMs investment structure and evolution | Mint]] [00:30:12]. [[IPMs investment structure and evolution | Mint]] was a systemic trading firm with three founders, similar to [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] [00:30:21]. Man Group saw [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] as valuable internal competition, akin to [[IPMs investment structure and evolution | Mint]] [00:30:46]. With [[IPMs investment structure and evolution | Mint]], Man Group held a 50% stake, resulting in a deadlock [00:31:13]. For [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]], they strategically aimed to buy a majority stake to control the investment management half of the enterprise [00:31:17]. This was described as an "extremely well executed maneuver" by Man Group [00:31:29].

### AHL's Perspective
For the founders of [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]], two primary motivations for the partnership were distribution and market access [00:31:38]. Man Group possessed a "machine" for raising money, which was highly attractive to [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] [00:31:42]. Crucially, [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] had determined that as an outsider, they simply could not achieve cost-effective access to markets [00:31:53]. In contrast, Man Group was deeply "plugged into the markets" that [[the_history_and_links_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] wished to trade [00:31:59].

## Challenges and Tensions

The motivations created considerable tension within the new partnership [00:32:06]. Man Group's brokerage division, which had forged the original deal with [[IPMs investment structure and evolution | Mint]], operated by adding their own time to execute orders, which was highly profitable with a secure order flow [00:32:11]. This approach counteracted [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]]'s drive to reduce the time between sampling and execution and to lower the cost per round turn [00:33:20].

[[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]]'s constant pursuit of faster and cheaper trading, driven by the need to exploit tiny market edges more quickly, directly conflicted with the brokerage division's natural instincts [00:33:30]. This led to an "uncomfortable few years" for [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]], feeling like a "constant war of attrition" [00:33:04].

## Long-term Outlook

At the time of the sale, the founders assumed there was a "very limited life" in what they were doing [00:43:40]. They were "extremely relieved" to sell to Man Group, believing the strategy would only work for another "three or four more years" [00:43:45]. Therefore, the continued success and institutional status of [[the_history_and_evolution_of_ahl_and_aspect_capital | AHL]] many years later was a significant surprise to them [00:43:54]. This perspective was shaped by a constant sense of urgency, as they always believed their edge would be taken away if they didn't keep moving fast [00:43:34].

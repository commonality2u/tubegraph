Long-term trading systems are characterized by strategies that hold trades for extended periods, aiming to capture significant market movements rather than frequent, small gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to [[shortterm_trading_strategies | shorter-term trading strategies]] and is often associated with [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend-following strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## The Case for Long-Term Systems

### Systematic and Mechanical Approach
A core characteristic of long-term trading, as employed by firms like Covenant Capital Management, is a [[systematic trading systems | systematic and mechanical approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This means performing the exact same actions every time a specific set of conditions is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Any degree of discretion, even infrequent overrides, can render a model discretionary in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The preference for [[Automated Trading Systems | systematic trading systems]] is driven by several factors:
*   **Estimating Efficacy**: A systematic approach allows the effectiveness of a strategy to be estimated through historical modeling and backtesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This provides a method to test hypotheses that discretionary approaches lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Wide Market Applicability**: [[Systematic trading strategies | Systematic models]] are easier to apply across a diverse range of markets without requiring specialized expertise in each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Emotional Detachment**: A primary reason for adopting a systematic approach is to remove emotions from the trading process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This ensures repeatability, where the same decisions are made regardless of external personal events or recent trading performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Cost Efficiency
A significant advantage of longer-term trading horizons is the reduction of trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. In a frictionless or costless world, random trading would break even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, real-world costs include commissions, bid-ask spreads, and slippage in fast markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. These costs are fixed per trade, meaning that holding a trade for eight minutes incurs the same bid-ask spread as holding it for eight months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

*   **Fixed Costs**: Trading costs (e.g., $35 per round turn for futures) are fixed, regardless of the holding period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Lower Hurdle**: For a given "trading edge" (a non-random entry and exit decision), a longer holding period means these fixed costs are amortized over a larger profit per trade, resulting in a lower hurdle for the strategy to clear to break even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This cost saving is considered a "fact," not an opinion or empirical evidence, and is not susceptible to "Black Swan" events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

### Robustness and Adaptability
[[Systematic and trendfollowing investment approaches | Systematic and trend-following investment approaches]] often emphasize robustness in their design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. This means using a minimal number of parameters and applying the same parameters across all markets, reducing the risk of "curve-fitting" to past market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. For example, using weekly data rather than daily or intraday data contributes to a longer-term perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.

The efficacy of various technical indicators (like moving averages or price breakout channels) is considered to make little difference in the long run; the time frame is what matters most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:51">[01:15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

### Differentiating Long and Short Trades
A key insight in long-term trading is that long trades (buying) and short trades (selling) should be treated differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. Long trades are "unbounded" (prices can theoretically rise indefinitely), allowing for much larger compounding returns than short trades, which are bounded by zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. For the same initial risk, a long position has a potentially much higher reward profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. While shorts can be profitable in certain periods (e.g., market declines), they are generally worse in the long run from a risk/reward perspective for a trend-following system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. However, shorts are still valuable as a diversifier against long positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Challenges

### Early Challenges and Perseverance
Launching a long-term trading firm, such as Covenant Capital Management in 1999, required minimal initial capital (three $250,000 accounts and $90,000 in working capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. This entrepreneurial endeavor was considered "insane" in retrospect, but it aimed to survive periods of bad luck until the winning method could prove itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

In the early 2000s, Covenant experienced significant drawdowns, leading to the loss of accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. During this period, the co-founders individually re-tested their entire model by hand, confirming its efficacy and ruling out internal errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>. This reinforced the belief that the poor performance was due to bad luck rather than a flawed strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. To persevere, one of the founders took an outside job to reduce costs and extend the firm's runway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>. This period of intense research also led to critical insights and improvements in the model, such as initially eliminating short trades and using a volatility filter for long trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

### Investor Behavior and Horizon Mismatch
One of the most significant [[Challenges and benefits of longterm trading horizons | challenges for long-term trading managers]] is the short-term horizon of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. Investors often chase whatever has performed well in the last 18 to 36 months, leading to inflows during periods of strong performance and outflows during drawdowns, regardless of the underlying strategy's long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. This behavior suggests that investors are not hardwired to have a long-term perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:54">[01:21:54]</a>.

### Market Impact and Liquidity Considerations
While some speculate about a risk of increased slippage if many large managers become long-term and try to exit positions simultaneously, observed data does not currently show a dramatic increase in slippage or truncation of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. Larger managers (battleships, over $750 million AUM and 10+ years track record) are limited primarily to highly liquid financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. Diversifying across more markets is scientifically desirable as it increases the instances an edge can be applied, leading to more predictable returns over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>.

## Covenant Capital Management's Approach

### Strategy and Philosophy
Covenant Capital Management runs multiple programs (Aggressive, Original, Optimal) that share the same trading signals but differ only in position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. They also offer custom programs for large institutional clients, adapting their model (e.g., long-only, commodities-only) to specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

Their strategy is based on a few core tenets:
*   **Time Frame**: Focus on long-term holding periods to minimize the impact of trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: Emphasize simple, robust models that avoid over-optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. They use the same model and parameters for all markets, predominantly looking at weekly data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
*   **Systematic Execution**: All trade decisions are mechanical, removing human emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Risk Control**: Managing risk through position sizing is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   **Understanding Asymmetries**: Acknowledge the fundamental differences between long and short trades and adapt tactics accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. They aim to get better at understanding how short trades work and why they are generally worse than longs, creating tactics to minimize their weakness while leveraging their diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>.
*   **Identifying Worthwhile Signals**: The core of their strategy is to identify which signals generated by their basic trend-following model are "worth taking risk on" without attempting to predict the exact size or duration of a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>. For example, using a volatility filter helps determine position size based on recent market volatility, improving profitability for a given trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>.

### Organizational Structure
Covenant Capital Management identifies itself as a "boutique" manager, differentiating itself from "battleships" (large, established firms with over $750 million AUM and 10+ year track records), "experimental" managers (large AUM but shorter track records), and "emerging" managers (smaller AUM, less than 10 years track record) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:18">[00:48:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.

As a boutique firm, Covenant aims to manage a stable amount of money (around $150-175 million spread across aggressive and original programs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. This size allows them to maintain exposure to a wide variety of markets, both long and short, that larger groups might trade but where those trades would have little impact on their overall outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>. They pride themselves on having a long trading history (over 10 years), reasonable infrastructure, and experience trading through multiple economic cycles and unpredictable world events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.

### Track Record and Future Expectations
Covenant acknowledges that track records can be misleading as they reflect "enormous amounts of variance and randomness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. They believe qualitative analysis of the trading method is often undervalued in favor of performance numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>. While their model has evolved over time, the success of past changes suggests future changes would also be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

For their original program, a reasonable expectation for investors after fees is around 15% annual return over a decade, with a maximal drawdown contained to less than 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

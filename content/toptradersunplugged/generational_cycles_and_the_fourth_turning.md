Neil Howe, a best-selling author and renowned historian, is the originator of the term "Millennials" and the theory of [[Generational cycles and the Fourth Turning | generational cycles]] [02:13:15]. His work posits that modern history moves in [[Generational cycles and the Fourth Turning | generational cycles]] that span approximately one long human life [03:35:00]. Each of these cycles consists of four distinct eras, or "turnings," with each turning lasting about 20 to 23 years [03:59:01].

## The Four Turnings

Howe argues that these [[Generational cycles and the Fourth Turning | cycles]] are driven by shifts in the public mood, which are themselves influenced by the human life cycle [03:49:00]. The current societal phase is a Fourth Turning, which is a period of significant upheaval and conflict [02:46:49]. Historically, Fourth Turnings have included events like the Great Depression and World War II, the American Civil War, and the American Revolution [02:58:00]. The good news is that societies that successfully navigate a Fourth Turning emerge "reborn, more equal, more optimistic, and more united" [03:09:14].

### First Turning: The High
The First Turning is a generational era that follows the resolution of a Fourth Turning (crisis) [05:18:21]. It is characterized by strong institutions and weak individualism, with a prevailing ethic of social conformity [05:52:54]. People are generally modest and make efforts to fit in with the needs of others [06:16:18]. This period sees society able to solve huge problems, fostering a great sense of progress [08:26:29]. There is a rising ethic and reality of equality, particularly in income and wealth [07:38:40]. The fear of the preceding crisis looms, which ensures that institutions remain robust [07:56:01].

*   **Example:** The period after World War II, encompassing the presidencies of Truman, Eisenhower, and John F. Kennedy [05:43:45]. This era saw the building of interstate highways, the space race to put a man on the moon, and the development of "miracle vaccines" [08:41:00].

### Second Turning: The Awakening
During the Second Turning, people tend to rebel against social conformity, rules, regulations, and social discipline [09:42:46]. There's a strong desire for individual expression and a shift from interest in the "outer world" to the "inner world" [11:03:05, 12:05:02]. Society becomes more individualized, less governed, less conformist, and increasingly less equal [13:09:18].

*   **Example:** The "Consciousness Revolution" from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s [10:14:16]. This period saw movements in inner cities and college campuses that sought to dismantle existing authorities and conventions, extending to conservative movements pushing for tax cuts and deregulation by the late 1970s and early 1980s [10:22:00]. Historical parallels include the Age of Jackson (1830s-early 1840s) and America's "Great Awakenings" [12:13:00].

### Third Turning: The Unraveling
The Third Turning is marked by strong individualism and weak institutions [16:09:12]. These decades are often characterized by weak civic authority, cynicism, and "bad manners" [16:31:31]. This era is typically defined by the generation coming of age that are children of the Awakening, such as Generation X [16:48:00]. This period ultimately leads to the next Fourth Turning [17:06:00].

*   **Example:** The mid-1980s up until the [[Global macroeconomic cycles and their influence on financial markets | Global Financial Crisis]] (GFC) in 2008 [16:12:14]. During this time, the concept of "end of history" became popular, suggesting markets and individualism had spread globally, leading to a fading role for governments and a society of "deracinated individuals" [26:37:00].

### Fourth Turning: The Crisis
The Fourth Turning is a period of "multiple crises" and ultimately "increasingly severe organized conflict" [17:15:18, 17:26:00]. Society, having entered this phase with almost no inherent order or security, begins to strongly desire it [18:54:00, 19:04:00]. New institutions are born, and a new republic emerges from the conflict [17:29:00].

*   **Catalyst:** A Fourth Turning begins with a "catalyst" â€“ a significant event that discredits existing institutions and their ability to provide security, leading to an initial period of extreme loss of trust [26:04:00].
    *   **Current Fourth Turning:** The [[Global macroeconomic cycles and their influence on financial markets | Global Financial Crisis]] (GFC) in 2008 served as the catalyst [25:57:00].
    *   **Historical Catalysts:** Preceding Fourth Turnings were similarly triggered by major financial shocks or political crises, such as Black Thursday in October 1929, the crash of 1857, and the London Crash of 1772 (which preceded the Boston Tea Party) [30:09:00, 30:35:00, 31:00:00].

## Dynamics of the Fourth Turning

### Polarization and Uncertainty
A key aspect of Fourth Turnings is intense polarization [35:36:00]. Society experiences a rapid and intensifying division, as people seek their "tribe" to create security and safety in a less safe world [35:55:00, 36:21:00]. This desire for community is particularly strong among younger generations like Millennials [36:37:00].

*   **Example:** The current era sees strong "Red Zone versus Blue Zone" divisions, with people geographically sorting themselves into communities based on political alignment [37:07:00]. This polarization can be compared to the 1930s, which was viewed as either the "red decade" by Republicans or the "fascist decade" by Democrats, both with valid reasons [38:18:00].

### Generational Roles and Values
Each turning is also defined by the characteristics of the generations coming of age within it.

*   **Millennials:** This generation craves order and social guarantees, shying away from the risk-taking individualism favored by previous generations [19:06:00, 19:12:00]. They are peer-oriented and community-focused, flocking to social media and prioritizing collective security [20:25:00, 20:38:00].
*   **Generation X:** As children of the Awakening, this "Nomad archetype" generation is cynical, pragmatic, and focused on getting the job done [55:46:00, 56:02:00]. They often feel internally torn about loyalties and may be divided between radical libertarianism and service to the social order [56:50:00].
*   **Boomers:** This "Prophet archetype" generation, coming of age during the Awakening, aims to transform values and focuses less on civic institutions [06:07:00, 06:13:00, 06:22:00, 06:26:00, 06:38:00, 06:42:00, 07:07:00, 07:11:00, 07:22:00, 07:27:00, 07:33:00, 07:49:00, 08:00:00, 08:06:00, 08:14:00, 08:24:00, 08:33:00, 08:37:00, 08:44:00, 09:02:00, 09:12:00, 09:15:00, 09:18:00, 09:21:00, 09:24:00, 09:31:00, 09:40:00, 09:43:00, 09:46:00, 09:50:00, 09:52:00, 09:58:00, 10:02:00, 10:04:00, 10:07:00, 10:09:00, 10:11:00, 10:13:00, 10:15:00, 10:17:00, 10:20:00, 10:22:00, 10:24:00, 10:26:00,

01:21:18:00, 01:21:19:00, 01:21:23:00, 01:21:25:00, 01:21:28:00, 01:21:30:00, 01:21:32:00, 01:21:34:00, 01:21:38:00, 01:21:41:00, 01:21:43:00, 01:21:44:00, 01:21:47:00, 01:21:49:00, 01:21:51:00,

During the current Fourth Turning, Boomers and Generation X are expected to "give up" fiscal promises to regain moral authority, making sacrifices so younger generations will "step up to the plates and keep the country together" [01:02:48, 01:03:06]. This is the inverse of the Awakening, where older generations yielded cultural ground to Boomers in exchange for material rewards like expanded Social Security and Medicare [01:03:20].

### Global Synchronicity of Cycles
Historically, the United States has shown the most regular [[Generational cycles and the Fourth Turning | generational turnings]] due to its founding principles [24:49:00]. However, these cycles are increasingly becoming global, with similarities observed across national boundaries [22:31:00, 22:38:00]. This is attributed to the increasing synchronicity of major historical events [22:47:00].

*   **Examples:** The last Fourth Turning (Great Depression and WWII) was a global phenomenon, affecting most of the world [22:54:00]. Similarly, the youth Awakening of the mid-1960s to early 1980s was not confined to the US but was seen in Paris, Berlin, Rome, Prague, China (Cultural Revolution), and Mexico City [23:21:00].

### Economic and Financial Implications
Fourth Turnings often lead to significant economic shifts. Historically, financial crashes have been related to the timing of Fourth Turnings [30:25:00]. These periods can result in the devaluation, confiscation, or destruction of assets, leading to greater equality [59:33:00]. Inflation is also a common feature, as governments rack up huge liabilities and use inflation to repudiate these debts [59:56:00, 01:00:07:00].

*   **Current Situation:** Public liabilities are very high (over 100% of GDP) even before any major conflict [01:00:32:00]. Unlike the GI generation who had ample fiscal room to build new institutions, today's government is largely an "insurance company with an army," with most spending going to individual payments [01:01:40:00, 01:02:13:00]. This necessitates "triage" during a Fourth Turning, requiring older generations to accept cuts to benefits [01:02:37:00].

## The Rebirth and Future Outlook
The current Fourth Turning is expected to see a full resolution in the early 2030s [01:00:00]. While the process will be traumatic, it leads to a rebirth of society where seemingly insurmountable problems can be solved in a decade or two [01:08:00].

Key social transformations expected at the end of a Fourth Turning and into a First Turning include:
*   **From individualism to community:** A fundamental shift toward collective well-being [01:10:05:00].
*   **From privilege to equality:** Society becomes more equal, not just economically but also socially, with a renewed ethic of fitting in and being helpful [01:10:20:00].
*   **From defiance to authority:** Leaders become more authoritative, and people are more likely to follow experts, as seen in the 1950s [01:11:17:00, 01:11:30:00].
*   **From deferral to permanence:** Social problems are not just deferred but permanently addressed, with new infrastructure and institutions built not only to solve current issues but also to prevent future ones [01:11:48:00, 01:11:57:00].
*   **From irony to convention:** Cultural expression shifts from cynical irony to a more conventional, modest, and less disorderly tone [01:13:22:00, 01:13:48:00].

Howe stresses that there's no "good or bad" turning; each is a compromise.

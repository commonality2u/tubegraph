The world is increasingly fractured, both internationally and domestically, particularly within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This fracturing is characterized by a lack of shared basic values and tenets among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Internationally, this fragmentation is evident in geopolitical aspirations, such as Russia's desire for Ukraine for safety, or China's aim to unify Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Domestically in the US, extreme political polarization leads to contentious issues and the potential for significant social disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This societal breaking is exacerbated by a lack of effective feedback mechanisms and information flow, further entrenching the fracturization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Global Economic Divergence and Central Bank Policies

The increased globalization of the 1980s and 1990s led to synchronized major economies and [[Central Banks policies and failures | central bank policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This synchronization was a function of real economy globalization, with increased trade and integrated supply chains, alongside open capital accounts allowing money to flow freely worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This co-movement was clearly visible in bond markets, where yields tended to move together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. For instance, US fiscal stimulus could boost factory conditions in China, with demand flowing globally through supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

However, this trend is now reversing, leading to increased fragmentation in both the real economy and in monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Monetary Policy Divergence
There is a growing [[Central bank divergence | divergence in central bank policies]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. While many central banks are tightening accommodative policies, the Bank of Japan, for example, is not, causing significant fissures in currency markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This reversal signifies an end to decades of convergence and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Real Economy Fragmentation
The world is entering a more fragmented state, with a developing axis between countries like Russia, China, the Middle East, and India, distinct from the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This will impede the free flow of commodities and supply chains, leading to more divergent economic conditions where US demand shocks may not easily pass to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Challenges for Central Banks in a Fractured World

### Fiscal Policy and Inflation
A significant driver of inflation going forward is a fundamental rethink in how [[impact_of_fiscal_dominance_and_central_bank_policies | fiscal policy is conducted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Governments financing spending by printing debt effectively print money, as treasuries are highly money-like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. With projected trillion-dollar deficits annually for the next decade, this revolutionary shift is a larger driver of inflation than monetary policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. This context suggests that the Fed may not be well-equipped to deal with future challenges, as fiscal spending continues irrespective of interest rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

### Loss of Dollar Reserve Status
The status of the US dollar as a global reserve currency is under threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. The dollar is the currency of international trade, used in about half of global transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This status ensures a strong demand for US treasuries, keeping US interest rates low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>.

The freezing of Russian assets, which were considered "safe," has created a crack in this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. Other sovereign nations with large dollar exposure, like China, now perceive this as an existential risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. This risk, whether from territorial aspirations or other political pressures, forces sovereigns to seek alternatives to the dollar, leading to less demand for treasuries and ultimately higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.

While the Fed can still control rates and FX markets by printing money or borrowing, they cannot print real economic goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. If a decline in dollar status leads to increased liquidity in the system and higher inflation, the Fed could lose control over its primary mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

### Political Disorder and Lack of Accountability
The system's design for efficiency over resilience means that if global supply chains or energy flows break down due to fragmentation, there could be tremendous distress, high prices, and even starvation in poorer countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. This "global disorder" could render market movements irrelevant, as basic things taken for granted are undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>.

The lack of accountability within large bureaucratic institutions like central banks poses a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. There are no consequences for failure, insulating staff and decision-makers from the repercussions of their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. For example, the "transitory inflation" call was a large policy mistake with no accountability mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. This insulation leads to a system that grows larger and more fragile, deferring minor crises until they become huge blow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### The Problematic Mandate
The core issue for the Federal Reserve is its mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. By aiming to smooth the business cycle, the Fed has inadvertently created much bigger problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. The Fed's effectiveness in dealing with inflation is limited because it often relies on mechanisms like the wealth effect, which has unequal distributional effects and may not quickly feed into the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. Moreover, the Fed's tools, primarily interest rates, disproportionately benefit corporations and contribute to asset inflation rather than trickling down to labor or real investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

This [[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_markets | monetary policy-driven economy]] has fueled secular deflation and increased inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The focus on the wealth effect as a demand-side tool, while increasing monetary policy mostly benefits capital, has led to a counterintuitive situation where pumping money into the system created deflation, and now removing it is also expected to be deflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This suggests that the current inflation is primarily driven by fiscal and external forces, rather than solely monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

### Future Outlook
The political disorder from fracturization, combined with global fragmentation impacting supply chains and commodity flows, presents a real risk of global disorder and significant distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. This environment suggests a "bull market for volatility" in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:22">[01:08:22]</a>. The treasury market plumbing is also a critical area to watch, as historically high issuance may outstrip available financing, potentially leading to discontinuities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:45">[01:08:45]</a>.

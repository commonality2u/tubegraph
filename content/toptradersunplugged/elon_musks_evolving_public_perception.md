The public perception of Elon Musk is undergoing a dramatic shift, moving from admiration to skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This change is seen as a significant symbol for the broader [[current_and_future_societal_changes | shift in the times]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## From Showman to Charlatan
Initially, Elon Musk was widely regarded as a "crazy brilliant guy who was changing the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>, doing "good things for society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a> and even seen as a "potential savior of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. However, his public perception is now "shifting more from showman gently at first towards charlatan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Indicators of Shifting Sentiment
Several factors contribute to this evolving perception:
*   **Twitter Takeover and Allegations** Recent events surrounding the Twitter takeover and subsequent allegations have played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a>.
*   **Political Affiliation** His "separation from the democratic party and has moved to the republican party" also marks a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.
*   **Decreased Defense** Fewer people are "keen to defend him anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>, indicating a decline in uncritical support.

## Elon Musk as a Barometer for Societal Change
Elon Musk is seen as embodying the recently concluded era, characterized by boldness, recklessness, and a disregard for rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. His companies, like Tesla, were perceived as the "embodiment of everything that zero cost of capital represented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>, where burning cash for years was acceptable as long as "wonderful things" were promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>.

The changing tide around Musk suggests a broader societal repudiation of "showmanship," "braggadocio," "ego," and "hubris" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>, which were fostered by upward-trending markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:30">[01:17:30]</a>. People are increasingly demanding "real" outcomes, as evidenced by questions about the delivery of promised technologies like self-driving cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:43">[01:16:43]</a>. This signifies a shift towards valuing "real" assets and tangible results over "virtual" or "fake" promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:40">[01:09:40]</a>.

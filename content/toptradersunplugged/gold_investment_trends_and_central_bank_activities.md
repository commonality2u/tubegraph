Gold, often regarded as insurance rather than an investment, historically performs well when individuals are concerned about maintaining their purchasing power in conventional savings and investment assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

## Gold's Performance in Economic Cycles

Historically, commodities, including gold, are characterized by being unusually cyclical, volatile, and capital-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. To succeed in commodities, an investor needs to be an instinctive contrarian, as these markets often induce boredom or torture for long periods before delivering spectacular returns over short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Patience is crucial, as timing commodities is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

The commodities sector has experienced two significant periods of outperformance:
*   **1969/1970 to 1981** This bull market saw most commodity prices increase by 10 to 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This period also coincided with 30-40 years of underinvestment in productive capacity, stemming from the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war boom where other industries received more investment attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
*   **2000 to 2011** This boom was driven by twenty years of underinvestment in natural resources, leading to capacity constraints, coupled with the economic growth and urbanization of China, which created significant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

Excesses from the 1970s market led to a bear market in the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Similarly, the 2000-2010 bull market led to the bear market from 2010 to 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. A new commodity bull market is anticipated, driven by systemic underinvestment and increasing global material living standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>.

## [[Inflation trends and Federal Reserve policies | Inflation]] and Interest Rates Impact

Gold tends to perform well during periods of [[Inflation and Currency Devaluation Trends | inflation]], especially when accompanied by persistently low [[Interest rates and currency trends | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. This is because [[Inflation and Currency Devaluation Trends | inflation]] increases the cost of establishing new productive capacity, thereby making existing capacity more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. [[Inflation and Currency Devaluation Trends | Inflation]] also acts as a barrier to entry for new market participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.

Currently, the US 10-year Treasury bond offers a 3.75% annual return, but in a currency that the Congressional Budget Office estimates is declining in purchasing power by 7.5% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This implies a promised annual reduction in purchasing power of almost 4%, a phenomenon dubbed "return-free risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. This environment creates concern among savers and makes gold an attractive option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

Negative real [[Interest rates and currency trends | interest rates]] are seen as a political phenomenon, a "war by spenders on savers," where the more numerous spenders win in a democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This trend is believed to be driving the current interest in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.

> "If you look at the economics as an example of the U.S 10-year Treasury the primary savings instrument in the world... the arithmetic that would attract people to gold is very evident in the U.S tenure treasury. The U.S government promises to pay you 3.75 percent... every year for 10 years in a currency that the Congressional budget office suggests is declining in terms of purchasing power by seven and a half percent a year so you take the 3.75 that they proposed to pay you and you subtract 7.5. What you see is that the U.S government is solemnly promising to reduce your purchasing power by almost four percent a year compounded for 10 years. My friend Jim Grant calls this return free risk." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>

## US Investor Ownership and Potential Demand

US investor ownership in precious metals is currently very low, approximately 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:07">[00:50:07]</a>. The long-term mean for this ownership is about 2%, and it has been as high as 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:14">[00:50:14]</a>. This low ownership suggests a significant potential for a bullish trend if the market reverts to its statistical mean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>. If market share of precious metals quadruples to 2%, demand for gold could increase dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

## [[Central bank policies and their influence on global markets | Central Bank Activities]]

[[Central bank policies and their influence on global markets | Central banks]] are buying gold not necessarily for the same reasons as individual investors, but because they understand the economic dilemmas they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

One major factor influencing [[Central bank policies and their influence on global markets | central bank]] gold purchases is the "weaponization of the US dollar" by the US Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>. Attempts to impose US political preferences extraterritorially through the Swift banking system have driven countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and India to reduce their reliance on the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:42">[00:57:42]</a>. This has led to a reluctant abandonment of the dollar standard in favor of other bilateral or multilateral standards, increasing demand for alternative assets like gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

> "I would suspect that the greatest enemy that the US dollar has is Congress, the idea that they've tried to impose extra territorially the political preference of the United States on countries like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, India... means that we have literally driven those central banks out of the Swift banking system, out of a reliance on the US dollar... the greatest promoter of disintermediation around the US dollar is in fact U.S Congress." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>

Despite the US dollar's relative strength in the last 15 years, it is viewed as "the prettiest mare in the slaughterhouse" because of the debasement of the American financial franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>. This debasement is driving the proliferation of gold and other alternative investment categories among [[Central bank policies and their influence on global markets | central banks]] globally, especially those feeling threatened by US policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Gold Mining

Investing in producing gold mining companies can be a reasonable strategy, particularly when measured by the net present value of free cash flow they could distribute over ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>. The "best 12 miners in the world" are currently at their cheapest levels ever, making them attractive investments if gold prices rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>.

The gold mining industry currently attracts very little competition from other investors, which is seen as a positive sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:27]</a>. Buying a sector when it is selling at a substantial discount, like "straw hats in winter," increases the probability of higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>. While the gold mining industry is considered "fertile terrain," few investors are currently active in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:34">[01:06:34]</a>.

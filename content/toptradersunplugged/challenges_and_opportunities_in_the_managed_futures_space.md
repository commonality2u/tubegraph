The [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures industry]] focuses on systematic investing, often employing a dependable and consistent, yet frequently overlooked, investment strategy [00:00:05]. Through the lens of a rule-based investor, the pulse of global markets is continuously assessed [00:00:30]. This approach aims to capitalize on market trends and provide diversification benefits, particularly during periods of market stress.

## Market Overview and Performance (January 2023)

January 2023 was a peculiar month for global markets [00:02:31]. The New Year began with a feeling of malaise, driven by disappointing holiday sales and economic data [00:02:36]. The stock market initially traded at December lows [00:02:44]. The Federal Reserve (FED) reacted to weak Q4 economic reports and stopping inflation by reducing the magnitude of rate hikes from 50 basis points to 25 basis points on February 1st [00:02:52]. The FED also suggested the peak of the rates cycle would be 5%, lower than the 5.25-5.5% communicated three months prior [00:03:11]. This messaging boosted investor concerns, influencing stock prices and bond yields [00:03:22]. The 30-year yield, for instance, dropped from 3.96% to 3.63% in January [00:03:30]. Paradoxically, equity indices rallied, with the S&P 500 gaining over 6% for the month and rallying nearly 20% off its October 2022 lows [00:03:45].

Despite an alarming number of layoffs, the employment situation remains robust, signaling a strong job market [00:04:11]. This is attributed to factors like Baby Boomer retirements and a general lack of desire to work, contributing to a worker shortage [00:04:21]. If this narrative holds, the FED might achieve its desired soft landing, though time will tell [00:04:38]. Currently, there appears to be a disconnect between the FED's statements and market interpretations [00:04:48].

The [[Managed futures industry and trend following | managed futures industry and trend following]] faced headwinds in January, with some managers experiencing more significant impacts than others [00:06:46]. Two of the strongest trends from 2022—rising global bond yields and the strong U.S. dollar—began to reverse course in January [00:06:53]. The question remains whether this is merely a bear market rally or a more fundamental shift [00:07:04]. Equities showed strength in January, but positions across different regions were not uniform within trend following, indicating a transition period [00:07:18]. Fixed income was a major driver of losses in January, with performance varying based on model speed [00:07:48]. Currencies also saw varied performance, with faster trend following models potentially picking up the dollar's weakness earlier [00:08:07]. Commodities were not the primary source of performance attribution in January, though smaller commodities saw big moves [00:08:39].

The Trend Barometer finished at 34, suggesting expected negative returns [00:14:48]. Early industry numbers for January showed:
*   The Beta50 index was down 0.11% [00:14:59].
*   The Sockgen CTA index was down 0.77% [00:15:05].
*   The Trend index was down 1.34% [00:15:09].
*   The Short-Term Traders index was down 0.17% [00:15:11].

While these overall performance figures are not dramatic, individual managers, especially those with longer-term models, experienced larger swings [00:15:22].

## Characteristics and Benefits of Managed Futures

[[Managed futures and trend following strategies | Managed futures and trend following strategies]] are considered the single most valuable diversifier for a portfolio comprising stocks and bonds [00:16:52]. Key characteristics and benefits include:
*   **Strong Returns:** A strategy (represented by the Sockgen CTA index from 2000 to present) has delivered 75% of equity returns and 120% of bond returns [00:18:46].
*   **Zero Correlation:** It has achieved these returns with zero correlation to either stocks or bonds [00:18:52].
*   **Limited Drawdowns:** Over 22 years, its maximum drawdown was 14%, less than a third of equities (which saw two 50% drawdowns) and now less than bonds [00:19:00].
*   **Crisis Alpha:** It performs best when 60/40 portfolios perform worst, such as during the dot-com crisis (2000-2002), the Global Financial Crisis (2008), and 2022 [00:19:15]. This "crisis alpha" ability to generate returns during market downturns is a key benefit [00:46:45].

From an asset allocation perspective, a 5% to 20% allocation to this strategy (defined broadly by the overall space) is highly beneficial, offering greater diversification than private equity or private credit, which remain correlated to equity and bond markets, respectively [00:19:24]. In a world where stocks and bonds are likely to move together for the next 10-20 years, [[Managed futures industry | managed futures]] becomes even more crucial [00:19:53]. This co-movement of stocks and bonds is observed when interest rates rise above approximately four percent, leading to positive correlations [00:22:24].

### Predictable Diversification Benefits
The concept of diversification has been a major driver in portfolio construction since the 1990s, with asset allocation identified as 90% of a portfolio's success [00:25:57]. [[Managed Futures Industry | Managed futures]] offers predictable diversification benefits across different time horizons:
1.  **Long-term Model Justification:** The long-term performance data, such as that from the Sockgen CTA index (140 years of hypothetical trend data), provides the justification for investment committees to include the strategy, as it improves Sharpe ratios and reduces drawdowns [00:32:01].
2.  **Near-term Crisis Protection:** In periods like 2022, even a small allocation (e.g., 2%) to [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] can significantly mitigate portfolio drawdowns, serving as a "beacon of green in a sea of red" [00:33:36]. This tangible benefit helps advisors manage client expectations during challenging times [00:34:20].
3.  **Client Management:** The ability to point to a performing asset class (like [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] in 2022) aids in client discussions, shifting attention to what is working [00:34:46].

## Challenges in Adoption and Perception

Despite its compelling benefits, [[Challenges and trends in the CTA and managed futures industry | managed futures faces challenges and trends]] in broader adoption:
*   **Low Allocation:** In the U.S. ETF space, [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] represents only 2-3 basis points of the total market [00:20:06]. In the mutual fund space, it's about $25 billion in assets, or 6% of the liquid alternatives world, and only 0.10% of the overall mutual fund world [00:20:17]. Many advisors have no allocation to this space [00:20:54].
*   **Difficulty in Explanation:** A significant challenge lies in explaining "why it makes money" in a simple, universally accepted way, similar to the "illiquidity premium" for private equity [00:42:02].
*   **Behavioral Biases vs. Constraints:** While behavioral biases (e.g., overconfidence, loss aversion) are often cited as reasons for trend following's effectiveness, a more compelling reason for its outperformance during regime shifts (like 2022 or the GFC) is the *constraints* faced by most investors [00:43:24]. Pension plans, model portfolios, and asset managers are designed to move slowly and are incentivized to maintain long-term, stable allocations [00:44:00]. This slow adaptation to rapidly changing markets or "regime shifts" creates an opportunity for agile, rules-based strategies like [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] [00:45:07].
*   **Client Timing and Expectation Management:** Investors often try to time the market, expecting to "buy the dip" or wait for the next crisis to invest [00:48:23]. This approach contradicts the long-term, complementary nature of [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] [00:51:15].
*   **Mistrust of Models:** There is a deep-seated suspicion about quantitative models, leading allocators to scrutinize them more than traditional stock pickers [00:59:31].
*   **Historical Misconceptions:** Some allocators still frame [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] based on outdated experiences, such as high fees (e.g., 10-point trailers from the 1990s) or perceived major blow-ups, despite evidence of reasonable drawdowns [01:00:00].
*   **Misunderstanding Strategy Nuances:** The market often lumps all [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] funds into one category, ignoring significant differences in strategies (e.g., trend vs. non-trend, short-term vs. long-term) and the resulting performance variability [00:35:50].

## Opportunities for Growth and Addressing Challenges

To encourage broader adoption, the [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures industry]] needs to refine its messaging and address investor perceptions. This forms part of the ongoing [[Challenges and opportunities in the hedge fund industry | challenges and opportunities in the hedge fund industry]].
*   **Focus on Outcome and Objective:** Instead of delving into the "nitty-gritty" details of models, the focus should be on the outcome for the portfolio, its objectives, and why the strategy was built the way it was [00:58:47].
*   **Trust in Expertise:** Emphasize that seasoned managers, doing this for decades, have every incentive to optimize their models [00:58:29].
*   **Relatable Metaphors:** Use simple, compelling metaphors that resonate with advisors and their clients, such as "hurricane insurance" or "riding market waves" that perform best during "tsunamis" (market crises) [00:56:37].
*   **Outsourcing Tactical Alpha:** Frame [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] as outsourcing a portion of the portfolio to experts who can react swiftly to market regime shifts, providing "tactical alpha" that traditional, slow-moving investors cannot capture [00:46:04]. This reframing avoids the negative connotations of "day trading" [00:47:06].
*   **Emphasize Predictable Diversification:** Highlight that [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] provides predictable diversification benefits due to its non-correlation, especially in times when traditional asset classes are highly correlated [00:27:00].
*   **Transparency and Cost:** Ensure clear transparency on fees, especially with the proliferation of new products and leveraged ETFs, to avoid past issues where "zero" fees turned out to be much higher [00:37:38].
*   **Long-Term Evidence:** Continuously present the long-term historical evidence that [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures]] strategies have consistently added value to traditional stock and bond portfolios over decades [00:24:29].

The goal is to grow the [[Managed Futures Industry | managed futures industry]] significantly (e.g., 5 to 10 times its current size) by finding ways to bring more people into the fold, benefiting both investors and their clients [01:00:37]. This involves an ongoing dialogue and comparison of notes within the industry to refine messaging and positioning [01:00:31].

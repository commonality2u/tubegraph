This article explores the landscape of systematic investing, market cycles, and the role of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] in navigating them, featuring insights from Niels Kaastrup-Larsen and Jim as part of the Systematic Investor Series.

## Systematic Investing and Market Pulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>
The Systematic Investor Series, hosted by Niels Kaastrup-Larsen and Jim, aims to take the pulse of the global market through the lens of a rule-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Previous discussions have covered topics such as detecting changes in trends and the utility of economic data versus price in investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Current Market Crossroads and Macro Concerns
Jim describes the current market as being at an "interesting Crossroads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. He notes that the relatively "well-telegraphed" springtime market has passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Key concerns include:
*   **Monetary Policy Lag** A lag in monetary policy continues to work through the economy, typically with an 12-to-18-month impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Effects are starting to be seen in housing, stock buybacks, private equity, and venture capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Debt Ceiling and Liquidity** The market is approaching a more illiquid summer period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Mid-month periods before quarterly options expirations (Opex) in February, May, or August tend to be structurally interesting and carry more risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Jim suggests that the resolution of the debt ceiling debate will ironically be a "sell the event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, as it will lead to the unwinding of deposit insurance effects and the refilling of the Treasury General Account (TGA), removing liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Inflation and Labor Market** Fed Governor Michelle Bowman has expressed concerns about high inflation and a tight labor market, indicating a potential need for continued interest rate hikes despite rates being at a 16-year high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Initial claims for unemployment benefits ticked up to 264,000, with the four-week moving average at 245,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Stagflationary Environment** Jim believes the market is not in a typical cyclical environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, but rather facing "structural secular inflationary headwinds" that are likely to remain sticky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. There is an increasing probability of stagflation, which is a difficult situation for the Fed, especially at the beginning of such an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## [[Trend following strategies | Trend Following]] Update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>
Niels reports that the market has been in a "non-trending environment" for most of the year from a [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. While there was some recovery in the last week of May, it has been driven by only a few markets, similar to how a handful of stocks have been responsible for most stock market gains this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Niels' own [[trend_following_investment_strategies | Trend Barometer]], which tracks the trendiness of a broad, diversified portfolio, is at 41, indicating a completely neutral stance with no conviction either up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Index performance as of the discussion:
*   **BTOP 50 Index:** Down 88 basis points for May, down 3% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Sock Gen CTA Index:** Down 72 basis points for May, down about 4% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Trend Index:** Down about 45 basis points, down about 5% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Traders Index:** Struggling, down 1.15% for May, down 3.3% for the year, and relatively underperforming given its lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Stocks (MSCI World):** Down 74 basis points for May, still up 7.5% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Stocks (S&P Index):** Down 93 basis points for May, still up 8% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Bonds:** Marginally up in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Market Topping Process and Positioning
Jim believes the market is in a "topping type process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Despite publicly understood macro realities, the market hasn't fully reacted due to **positioning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If everyone expects something, it doesn't happen as expected because of the reflexive effects of dealer positioning, especially in options markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.If there is a lot of short interest or put buying, it can lead to reflexive support for the market â€“ a "wall of worry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

This "macro versus positioning" dynamic usually ends in one of two ways:
1.  **Time:** Risk increases with time, and participants become willing to take more risk or sell risk premia if expected events don't materialize quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Fear diminishes, and those buying protection eventually give up due to cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This unwinding of positioning often precedes a market decline, as seen in 2007 (before 2008) and 1999-2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
2.  **Price:** A sufficiently large rally or "stretching" of markets can shake short positioning, squeeze shorts, and force institutions back in due to underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This also naturally drives implied volatility lower, reaching levels where participants buy it, removing liquidity from dealers and leading to "unpinned" volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This can lead to "blow-off tops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Jim points to the November 2021 to February 2022 period as a recent example, where despite expectations of Fed rate hikes and positioning for a decline, a seasonally positive period led to a "blow-off top" before the market unwound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### Tops vs. Bottoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>
Market tops typically take longer to form than bottoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This is because the world is inherently "long" (people own homes, jobs, assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Panic and stress selling are expedited into declines, making them more volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Markets also have a natural upward bias long-term due to human growth and creation of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This dynamic leads to market skew and dealer positioning that makes it harder for markets to go down quickly at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### Current Short Positioning and Macro Realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>
Despite the Fed pausing rate hikes, many investors are still short. Jim explains this is due to underlying secular realities, not just Fed action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. These include:
*   **Sticky Inflation:** The reality of how sticky inflation has been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Tensions:** Continued escalation of geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Resource Scarcity and Economic Warfare:** Ongoing issues related to resource scarcity, like OPEC, and economic warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Unemployment:** Despite rate hikes from zero to five percent, unemployment is at a new record low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

These realities make the current situation "more dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>, pushing the market along a secular path of stagflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

### Impact of AI on Employment and Society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>
Jim acknowledges AI as a technological advancement that is inherently deflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. He argues that the current "exuberance" around AI is a consequence of 40 years of near-zero interest rates and massive investment in technology and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. As money is now being pulled away, future technological advancement investment will slow, though with a much bigger lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

He emphasizes that while technological advancement will continue as a "never-ending trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, it doesn't change the realities of supply and demand or the ability to supercharge or deplete that advancement over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

Jim agrees on the social impact of technological advancement:
*   **Three-Legged Deflationary Stool** For 40 years, the global economy has been on a "three-legged deflationary stool" tied to monetary policy: cheap money, globalization, and technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. These factors enabled corporations to lower capital costs, dramatically helping margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.
*   **Unwinding the Stool** The unwinding of these factors, especially rising interest rates, leads to protectionism and populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. The distribution of wealth has become too skewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Generational Impact** Younger generations (Millennials downwards) are at the bottom of wealth stratification and have been at the "wrong part of the cycle," driving populism and frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. AI's potential to exacerbate unemployment in the middle class could make things worse for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.
*   **Government Role** Society vacillates between trusting capital markets as allocators and needing government intervention to make things "more fair," especially after crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

### Earnings Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>
Jim draws parallels to the 1968-1982 period, which also experienced inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>. During that time, GDP growth was above trend even in real terms, yet the market saw significant real losses (e.g., 70% loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. This disconnect was largely due to **margin compression** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

If trends like onshore production, slowing technological advancement, and soaring capital costs unwind, margins will collapse, and labor power will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:34">[00:38:34]</a>. While price-to-earnings ratios are often discussed, price-to-sales ratios are "through the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. Jim expects a "dramatic reduction in price to sales" due to margin compression to play a major role in the stock market going nowhere in the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>.

### Passive vs. Active Investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:39">[00:39:39]</a>
The rise of passive investing is seen as a technological advancement, but Jim argues that indexing has existed for over a hundred years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. It didn't work from 1968 to 1982 because buying and holding stocks yielded negative real earnings and high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>. That period saw the rise of hedge funds, derivatives, and value investing â€“ strategies focused on dynamic, active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

Jim's view is that in a period similar to what's likely to come, passive investing "will all of a sudden become not investable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. He expects to see more "active passive products" and a significant decline in passive investing over the next 5-10 years, as it simply "doesn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. Conversely, he anticipates a significant increase in active management, where deep expertise can create non-correlated returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

### May Opex Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>
Jim has pointed to May as a critical period for some time, similar to how February Opex played out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. He notes that while they would have preferred to see a new high and a bigger "thrust" or "squeeze" to truly unpin volatility and create a larger decline, it hasn't happened yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.

Nevertheless, the period leading into and through May Opex (especially the next week and a half to two weeks from the discussion) is structurally a time for caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>. This is due to the banking issues and, more importantly, the debt ceiling and how volatility structure is pricing in June Opex (a quarterly Opex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. There is less volatility supply in June due to this exacerbation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. Jim cites February-March 2020 as an example where a rally depleted volatility before a significant decline began the day after March Opex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:12">[00:48:12]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook: Debt, US Hegemony, and Gold
### What Could Change the Bearish View? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>
Jim states that his bearish thesis is broadly tied to the secular reality of interest rates, diminishing liquidity, and the knock-on effects of deglobalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. His view would change if:
*   China and the U.S. shifted away from a "Cold War" trend back to cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   The Fed could lower interest rates to zero without causing an inflationary result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.
*   Populism and global fiscal activity diminished and showed signs of turning around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>.

He emphasizes that these are big, structural trends, not dependent on one person's or one government's decision, but rather the effects of 40 years of monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.

### The Debt Issue and US "Exorbitant Privilege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>
Jim acknowledges that prominent investors like Stan Druckenmiller and Ray Dalio warn about the massive buildup of debt, particularly in the U.S., and its negative impact on future prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:08">[00:53:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. However, Jim holds a nuanced view, arguing that debt, at its core, is **not the primary issue** for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:45">[00:55:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>.

He believes it's misguided to apply a linear, individual-based financial model to a country like the U.S. in a "Fiat World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:31">[00:56:31]</a>. The U.S., as the holder of the primary global currency, has the "exorbitant privilege" to create and remove debt without massive repercussions, as long as it remains the dominant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:28">[01:02:28]</a>. He points to the 10 trillion dollars of debt printed in recent years, during which the dollar actually strengthened, as evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. Money tends to flow back to the center in times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:29">[01:02:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a>.

Jim highlights the U.S.'s unique position of safety:
*   Geographical protection by two oceans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:17">[00:58:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>.
*   Largest economy and military in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.
*   Resource-heavy with abundant food and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:32">[00:58:32]</a>.
*   Strong, albeit imperfect, decentralized rule of law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>.

He concludes that while a "slow decline" of the U.S. empire might be occurring, it's unlikely to happen in the next 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:31">[01:00:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:40">[01:00:40]</a>. Therefore, debt is unlikely to be the primary cause of a major U.S. implosion; other global economic issues are more significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

### Gold Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>
Gold is currently sitting near all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:59">[01:03:59]</a>. Jim asserts that during the current market regime, there will be significant volatility in commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>. After an initial decline where people "gave up on gold," it is now squeezing and about to break out to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.

While a straight line up is not expected, the trend is very much in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. The recommended way to play it is by leveraging the "leptokurtic distribution" (fat tails), specifically by playing the upside calls where volatility has been too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:18">[01:05:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:23">[01:05:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>.

From: [[toptradersunplugged]] <br/> 

Commodities are a unique and often challenging asset class, characterized by their cyclical, volatile, and capital-intensive nature. Successfully navigating these markets requires a specific mindset, often emphasizing contrarianism and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.

## Speaker's Background and Approach

Rick Rule, a retired investor, speculator, and entrepreneur, has focused on natural resources and commodities since 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. His career has involved building financial services companies, including banks, insurance companies, and wealth/asset managers, primarily within the natural resources sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

Rule describes his past investment approach as "speculating wildly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>, often financing exploration, which is among the riskiest businesses, with only about 1 in 3,000 mineralized anomalies becoming a mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. He learned to reduce risks by concentrating efforts around serially successful earth scientists and geologists, particularly in similar terrains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

### Notable Speculative Experiences

*   **Hemlo Deposit (1970s)**: Rule helped finance the discovery of half of the fabled Hemlo gold deposit in Canada, which became a 30-million-ounce deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. An initial financing level of 30 cents per share saw a takeout later in the decade at around $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Rule attributes his initial success in the 1970s gold and silver bull market (gold from $35 to $850, silver from $1.50 to $50, oil from $3 to $30) to market conditions rather than his own brilliance, a lesson learned during the 1980s commodity collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Democratic Republic of Congo (1994-2000)**: Rule extensively invested in countries with high political risk. His "crowning success" in this area was a move into the Congo during a civil war where millions died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Despite the chaos, he faced little competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>. He invested in Tenke Mining, which controlled the largest and highest-quality undeveloped copper deposit globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. The stock, controlled by the "best entrepreneurs" in the resource sector, was selling at 19 Canadian cents per share with 30 cents per share cash, offering an 11-cent discount to cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. The potential upside was $5 per share, creating a highly asymmetric risk-reward profile (losing 19 cents for potentially making $5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. The stock ultimately went to $17 or $18 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>.
*   **Bre-X (1990s)**: Rule describes his fourth or fifth largest career score as occurring from a "blatant fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Based on a geologist's recommendation, he and clients invested in Bre-X, which was exploring in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. Financed at $1 per share with a $1.50 warrant, the stock peaked at $280 per share before the fraud was exposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. Rule exited his position before the fraud became public, due to concerns about the CEO's intoxication, the purported size of the deposit attracting government attention, and the company's market capitalization exceeding Freeport copper and gold (which paid an 8.5% dividend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

## Characteristics of Commodity Markets

[[Volatility in Commodity Markets | Commodity markets]] are known for their extreme cyclicality and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. They tend to bore or torture investors for long periods, then deliver spectacular returns over short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Timing these markets is difficult due to numerous influencing factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Patience is crucial for [[Investing during economic shifts | investing]] in inevitable trends that may not be imminent, to capture the initial, often significant, portion of a market move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. A contrarian mindset is essential for success; otherwise, investors are highly likely to become victims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Historical [[Commodity super cycles | Commodity Cycles]]

Rick Rule identifies two major periods of outperformance in commodity markets during his lifetime:
*   **1969/1970-1981**: This bull market saw almost every commodity increase by 10 times, with some rising by 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This period also coincided with 30-40 years of underinvestment in productive capacity, stemming from the Great Depression and World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **2000-2011**: This bull market was driven by two factors: 20 years of underinvestment in natural resources leading to capacity constraints, and the economic miracle of China's urbanization, which created significant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

The excesses of the 1970s bull market led to the commodity bear market of the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Similarly, the successes of the 2000-2010 bull market contributed to the subsequent bear market from 2010 to 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## Current Commodity Outlook and Drivers

Rule suspects that a new [[commodity_super_cycle_in_2023 | commodity bull market]] is emerging, primarily due to systemic underinvestment in natural resources by society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This is coupled with the rising material living standards of humankind, particularly the poorest half of humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. When poor people gain more money, their consumption becomes extremely commodity-intensive (e.g., shoes, bicycles, cars, cinder block homes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

Over the last 40 years, two billion people have been lifted out of dire poverty, and access to primary electricity has significantly improved (from 3 billion people having no access to 1 billion today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. The next 20 years will focus on providing electricity to the remaining billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This materially intensive effort, combined with declining production in various natural resource products (oil, gas, copper, cobalt, zinc) due to underinvestment in exploration and productive capacity, points to a looming supply crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

With 8 billion people on Earth seeking higher material living standards, this classic economic scenario of increased demand and reduced supply is expected to drive commodity prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The primary caveat is a potential synchronized global recession or depression, which could dampen price expectations by reducing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

## Inflation, Economy, and Commodities

Inflation, while detrimental to humankind, often boosts the relative performance of commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Cost of establishing productive capacity**: Inflation can skyrocket the cost of new capital-intensive projects, increasing the value of existing productive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Barrier to entry**: Inflation acts as a barrier to entry for new market participants, further enhancing the value of established producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Precious Metals**: Inflation, especially when accompanied by persistently low interest rates, is particularly beneficial for precious metals like [[Gold and commodity cycles | gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Gold performs well when people are concerned about maintaining purchasing power in conventional savings and investment assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

The U.S. 10-year Treasury bond, a primary global savings instrument, currently offers a promised 3.75% return in a currency that the Congressional Budget Office suggests is declining by 7.5% per year in purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This results in a guaranteed reduction of purchasing power by almost 4% annually, compounded for 10 years, a phenomenon Jim Grant calls "return-free risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This scenario makes gold an attractive hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### Inflation as a Political Phenomenon
Inflation is viewed primarily as a political phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. The pursuit of "free beer and a free lunch" through policies like artificially low interest rates and increased spending, often voted for by the more numerous spenders over savers, leads to massive debt and deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. This burdens future generations with the costs of current consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies in commodities | Investment Strategies]] in Commodities

To be successful in the commodity business, one needs to be an instinctive contrarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Commodities are "inevitable but not eminent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Investors must be patient and tenacious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Gold as an Investment and Insurance
Rule views gold not as an investment or speculation, but as insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. While Warren Buffett calls gold a "pet rock" that doesn't produce anything, Rule argues that insurance also doesn't produce anything, but provides peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. For those who cannot consistently generate real economic returns exceeding inflation, gold serves as a necessary insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

Gold has historically performed well during periods of concern about the maintenance of purchasing power in conventional savings instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Current negative real interest rates worldwide are seen as a mechanism to plunder savers for the benefit of spenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

The market share of precious metals and related assets in the United States is currently at 0.5%, compared to a long-term mean of 2% and a high of 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. A reversion to the mean would quadruple demand for precious metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

Central banks are increasingly buying gold, not only due to their own dilemmas but also because of the "weaponization of the U.S. dollar" by the U.S. Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This imposition of U.S. political preferences on other countries has driven nations like China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, and India away from reliance on the U.S. dollar and the Swift banking system, thereby actively destroying the dollar's franchise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. The dollar's strength in recent years is attributed more to the relative weakness of its competitors than its own inherent strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

### Investing in Gold Mining Companies
Rule invests in producing gold mining companies that are competitive in terms of the net present value (NPV) of their free cash flow over 10 years, compared to other industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. He assesses them by comparing their NPV from on-balance-sheet reserves and resources at current commodity prices with their Enterprise Value (market capitalization plus debt minus cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Currently, the "best 12 miners in the world" are at their cheapest level in his entire career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Political and Social Factors Affecting Commodities

### ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance)
Rule is a proponent of responsible investing in a market sense, rather than through collectivist ideologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Environment (E)**: He questions policies that could reverse the Green Revolution's success in feeding 8 billion people, or favor artisanal extraction methods over capital-intensive, environmentally safer ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Social (S)**: He highlights the social responsibility of addressing energy poverty for a billion people and calorie consumption deficits for 300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:1:43">[04:1:43]</a>.
*   **Governance (G)**: Rule challenges whether spawning envy, accumulating debt and deficits, and financing current consumption on the backs of future generations constitute good governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

He notes growing pushback against "the politics of extinction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>, especially from people reacting to what they perceive as hypocrisy from elites (e.g., private jets to Davos while advocating less driving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Rule argues that decisions should be made in markets, not by "big thinkers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Economic prosperity often leads to greater environmental care, as habitat preservation occurs best when people are wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Deglobalization and Supply Chains
Despite narratives of deglobalization and supply chain disruptions (e.g., Airbus running out of aluminum due to Russia, Russia losing production capabilities without Western technology), Rule believes markets will ultimately work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. While there may be short-term challenges (2-4 years), if there's a demand for technology or resources, other suppliers (e.g., China, India) will emerge to fill the void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The narrative eventually gives way to arithmetic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Outlook and Market Dynamics

Rule concludes that in the next five years, absent a synchronized global recession or depression, society will face a supply crunch across various extractive industries due to systemic underinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. This, combined with increasing global demand from a growing population, is a classic scenario for rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

Ultimately, market prices validate narratives. When a commodity price rises, it reinforces the belief in the investment thesis, even if the price appreciation has already taken out a significant portion of the future net present value of the trade. Thus, a contrarian must also know when to sell after their conviction has been proven correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

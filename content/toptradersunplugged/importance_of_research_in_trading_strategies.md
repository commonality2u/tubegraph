Research is a critical and continuous process in developing and refining [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. It involves constantly evaluating whether there's a better way to operate and adapting to evolving market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## The Research Cycle

Research is an ongoing activity, with professionals constantly asking if there's a better way to perform their tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. A key challenge is knowing whether to make changes too soon or not quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. The market's inherent randomness means that the benefits of a change may not be immediately apparent, nor are positive effects guaranteed to last indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

It is generally considered best to implement changes when a trading program is at a new equity high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. The decision to make a change should align with the basic design philosophy and structure of the program, helping to determine if a particular change genuinely adds value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

## Impact of External Factors

Major research findings often stem from unprecedented market events, such as the extraordinary role central banks played in bond and equity markets following the Lehman crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. This highlighted the need to quantify trend strength and understand how external environments impact system performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. For example, a "Road Trend Barometer" was developed to provide context for performance based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. While system rules are preset, understanding if they can be "defeated" by environmental factors is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## Research Philosophy and Adaptation

For the Altus program, the core systems have remained largely unchanged over six years, with only minor tweaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. New systems are introduced to fill gaps and reinforce the existing design philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>. The program's design emphasizes adaptability and flexibility while maintaining consistent rules across all markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.

## Challenges of Research

### Over-researching and Randomness
It is possible to conduct too much research and make too many changes, especially given the inherent randomness of markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. A change made in response to a recent environment does not guarantee future positive effects, as market conditions constantly evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Even large managers with significant research capabilities have experienced severe drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Ultimately, [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] requires discipline and the ability to absorb volatility, ignoring day-to-day market noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Role of Academic Qualifications
While investors often desire firms to conduct research, and some believe more PhDs lead to better research, real-life CTA track records demonstrate that academic qualifications are neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for great performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. However, PhDs can add value, particularly for larger managers who face more complex challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

## Why Trend Following Systems Make Money
[[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | Trend following systems]] primarily generate profits through a few "massively outlier trades" that are significantly more profitable than initially expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. This happens because new information changes the market or has not been properly factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Markets may not quickly recognize fundamental changes or driving forces may persist longer than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. The core philosophy is to wait for these "Mega Trends" to occur, which requires a [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic]] and disciplined approach, putting on positions, and holding them as long as possible, waiting for the market to move further and longer than generally anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.

## Future Outlook for CTA Strategies
The primary way to reignite interest in CTA strategies is a return to profitability for [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. This can occur with the emergence of strong trends, sharp reversals in equity markets allowing CTAs to reposition faster, or a diminishing role of central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Increased interest will also be driven by better performance within the CTA industry as a whole, a lack of performance in other key sectors like equities and bonds, and the emergence of significant trends due to supply-demand disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

The fundamental purpose of CTAs is to provide offsets to portfolios of equities and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. Unlike buying direct protection (like puts), CTAs can be profitable, making them a less onerous form of portfolio insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Firms like Row specifically design systems to respond to changes in equity and bond markets across various time frames, demonstrating positive offsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:06">[00:38:06]</a>. This provides investors with the ability to go short, trade other instruments, and react faster than their traditional long equity/long bond strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a>. The design ensures a high probability of making money when trends emerge, delivering consistent, unemotional, and high-speed responses, which is crucial for investors during rapidly moving or confusing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Becoming a Great Trader
To become a great trader or CTA, one needs to be an optimist to survive in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. It also requires bringing an original point of view on how to trade and being able to clearly explain one's actions to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

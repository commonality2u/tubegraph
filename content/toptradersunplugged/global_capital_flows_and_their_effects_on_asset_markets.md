Michael Howell, Managing Director of CrossBorder Capital, an advisory and research firm focused on capital flows, discusses his framework for understanding markets, which centers on [[the_impact_of_market_liquidity_and_flows|liquidity]] and capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:39">[03:10:39]</a>. He emphasizes that understanding where the money is truly drives asset markets and, ultimately, the real economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>.

## Michael Howell's Liquidity Framework

Howell's philosophy, deeply embedded during his time at Salomon Brothers, posits that global liquidity, or the flow of funds, is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:02">[03:32:02]</a>. His work extends this concept from a US-centric view to an international one, considering the actions of [[central_bank_policies_and_their_influence_on_global_markets|central banks]] like the Bank of Japan, the ECB, and the People's Bank of China (PBOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:03">[04:01:03]</a>.

### Defining and Measuring Liquidity
[[impact_of_liquidity_on_global_financial_markets|Liquidity]] is defined as the flow of funding liquidity or funding through markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:19">[05:00:19]</a>. It represents the total credit issued by banks and shadow banks, combined with savings from households or corporations, essentially measuring the financial sector's balance sheet capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

Asset markets are influenced by two moving parts:
1.  **Flow of Global Liquidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>
2.  **Risk Exposure of that Money/Deployment of Funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>

The liquidity cycle typically lasts about five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Since its bottom around October 2022, liquidity has been expanding, albeit slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Recent events, such as chaos in the Yen carry trade, indicate a shift in investor risk exposure rather than a change in liquidity itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

### Central Bank Influence
Different [[central_bank_policies_and_their_influence_on_global_markets|central bank policies]] have distinct impacts:
*   **Federal Reserve (Fed)**: Primarily influences financial markets due to the dollar-based global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   **People's Bank of China (PBOC)**: Tends to influence the Chinese economy, and due to China's large economic footprint, it affects the tempo of the world economy and commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

While central bank actions, such as quantitative easing (QE), directly inject liquidity by buying bonds and supplying cash, their full effect on markets operates over medium-term periods (e.g., three to six months), not days or weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. The focus should be on the *flow* of new money, as markets are priced at the margin, making momentum critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Global Capital Flows

### Post-Global Financial Crisis (GFC) to Post-COVID
Following the 2008-2009 GFC, [[central_bank_policies_and_their_influence_on_global_markets|central banks]] stimulated sluggish economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. This period, particularly from 2010-2012, saw money flow into financial markets, lifting asset prices and eventually picking up the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

Several factors spurred strong inflows into US assets:
*   **Regulatory Changes**: Basel III, aiming to compel financial institutions to hold more safe assets like US Treasuries, drove money into the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   **Eurozone Banking Crisis (2010-2012)**: Led to an exodus of money from the Eurozone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.
*   **China's Anti-Corruption Crackdown**: Resulted in capital leaving China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

This overall movement of capital into dollar assets exemplifies a classic [[the_impact_of_market_liquidity_and_flows|liquidity]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. When capital flows into an economy, its real exchange rate should rise, which, in a modern economy with sticky consumer prices, primarily manifests as rising asset markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. This explains the rise of Wall Street and the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:04]</a>.

### China's Capital Exodus
Conversely, China has experienced a significant capital exodus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. This is attributed to China hitting a "middle-income trap," compromising its productivity, and [[geopolitical_influences_on_financial_markets|tensions between America and China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. As capital leaves, China's real exchange rate must fall, leading to Yuan devaluation and/or collapsing asset markets and deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. China's reluctance to print money to boost its real exchange rate, due to concerns about increasing its already high debt, has forced the adjustment through asset markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.

### Yield Curves and Term Premium
The behavior of bond yields, including the multi-decade decline ending around 2020 and subsequent rise, is largely a [[the_impact_of_market_liquidity_and_flows|liquidity]] phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>. Michael Howell's learning from Salomon Brothers was that flows of liquidity into markets cause the yield curve to steepen, and flows out cause it to flatten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. This effect operates with a 6 to 9-month lead time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>.

The transmission mechanism is primarily through **term premium**, which is the extra return required to compensate for future interest rate uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. In a highly liquid market with less systemic risk, investors shift out of safe assets like bonds into higher-risk assets, causing the term premium to rise and the yield curve to steepen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>. The ongoing increase in government debt issuance also affects term premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.

## Debt Refinancing and Monetary Inflation

A key insight is that recent financial crises are fundamentally refinancing crises, forcing [[central_bank_policies_and_their_influence_on_global_markets|central banks]] to provide liquidity to roll over debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>. With global debt at $350 trillion and an average maturity of five years, $70 trillion needs to be refinanced annually just to stand still, requiring massive balance sheet capacity (liquidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>.

### The New Economic Cycle
Historically, economic cycles were driven by capital spending (9-10 year cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>. However, capital markets are now primarily debt refinancing systems, with roughly three out of every four dollars transacted related to debt refinancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>. This dominance of financial markets forces the economy to adopt a shorter, five to six-year cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:35:00">[28:35:00]</a>.

### Monetary Inflation and its Hedges
The US public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to double over the next 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>. This implies public debt growth at twice the rate of GDP (10-12% annually), meaning global liquidity must expand similarly, leading to monetary inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:00">[29:53:00]</a>.

Factors contributing to escalating debt include:
*   Aging demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>
*   Rising defense bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>
*   Commitments to welfare state spending (Medicare, Social Security) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>

Monetary inflation differs from "High Street" (consumer price) inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>. While monetary inflation contributes to High Street inflation, the latter also depends on factors like taxes, costs, productivity gains, and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. Monetary inflation will outpace High Street inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>.

In this environment of persistent monetary inflation, investors should consider monetary inflation hedges:
*   **Gold**: A proven hedge over centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:45:00">[30:45:00]</a>. If liquidity expands tenfold by 2050 (based on 10-12% annual growth), gold could reach $25,000 an ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin**: Has proven to be a wonderful hedge against monetary inflation over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>.

### Debt Sustainability and Social Tensions
Governments globally are facing rising interest bills due to increasing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a>. Governments can sustain very high debt-to-GDP ratios, as seen in Britain in the 1950s and Japan recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. The question becomes what type of debt and at what price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:49:00">[35:49:00]</a>. Shorter-dated debt, potentially at higher yields, leads to monetization, which is the system's way of inflating away debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:53:00">[35:53:00]</a>. This process of monetary inflation increases wealth for asset holders but disadvantages wage earners, leading to social tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>.

### US Treasury's Role
The US Treasury, possibly in cooperation with the Fed, is engaging in a deliberate duration management strategy, shifting issuance towards shorter-dated tenors and increasing Bill finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>. This suppresses yields at the longer end of the market and forces term premium lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:20:02]</a>. When credit providers (banks) buy government debt, their balance sheets expand, leading to monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15:00">[39:15:00]</a>.

## Current Market Dynamics and Outlook

The liquidity cycle has been expanding since late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The period of quantitative tightening (QT) in the US effectively ended 18 months ago, with the Fed actively pushing liquidity into markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:27:00">[24:27:00]</a>.

### Yen and Dollar Dynamics
The dramatic fall of the Japanese Yen since early 2022, coinciding with the [[impact_of_globalization_and_global_conflict_on_investments|Russia-Ukraine conflict]], suggests an engineered deal, potentially to pressure the Chinese financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>. This might have forced China into significant monetary tightening, contributing to its economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:48:00">[44:48:00]</a>. The recent Yen rally might indicate a deal was struck, implying the dollar could begin to weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:05:00">[45:05:00]</a>. This situation has parallels to the 1985 Plaza Accord, where the US eased monetary policy to bring down a strong dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:55:00">[45:55:00]</a>.

The Yen carry trade is estimated to be around $500-$600 billion, which, while significant in certain areas like the Nikkei or Mexican peso, is not massive in the context of $175 trillion global equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:39:00">[48:39:00]</a>. A potential dollar weakening could lead to the Fed injecting more cash, acting as a source of new liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:27:00">[49:27:00]</a>.

### Outlook for Asset Markets
The environment appears favorable for risk assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>. While significant gains have already been seen since late 2022, the market is maturing, implying smaller future gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07:00">[56:07:00]</a>.

For [[asset_allocation_and_macroeconomic_risks|asset allocation]] in this environment:
*   **Equities**: Good quality equities, especially companies with pricing power, are favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:43:00">[40:43:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds**: Avoid longer-dated debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:00">[40:15:00]</a>; prefer short-dated debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:20:00">[40:20:00]</a> and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) if yields are attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:23:00">[40:23:00]</a>.
*   **Commodities**: Should be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>.
*   **Gold and Cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin)**: Essential as monetary inflation hedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.

The traditional 60/40 portfolio model no longer works because in a higher inflation environment, bonds tend to suffer, and equity prices become positively correlated with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>.

High Street inflation is expected to converge more closely with monetary inflation if productivity gains slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a>. However, cyclically, High Street inflation may be in a downswing due to the slowdown in the Chinese economy, which has resulted from tight monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20:00">[42:20:00]</a>.

### Key Factors to Watch
The three most important factors for a quick view of market dynamics are:
1.  **Federal Reserve actions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:49:00">[56:49:00]</a>
2.  **People's Bank of China actions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:50:00">[56:50:00]</a>
3.  **MOVE Index of bond market volatility**: Reflects volatility in the US Treasury Market, which is a key collateral base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:53:00">[56:53:00]</a>. High bond volatility increases "haircuts" (reduced collateral value by credit providers), adversely affecting the collateral multiplier and reducing global liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:07:00">[57:07:07]</a>.

A world of low or falling bond volatility and expanding [[central_bank_policies_and_their_influence_on_global_markets|central bank liquidity]] creates a favorable environment for rising global liquidity, leading to higher asset prices as investors take on more risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:24:00">[57:24:00]</a>.

### China's Dollar Dependence
Despite China's efforts to reduce dollar dependence, the global financial system remains dollarized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:37:00">[58:37:00]</a>. Holders of Yuan often convert them back into dollars, and the use of non-US banks to recycle funds reduces the efficiency of dollar supply, ultimately underpinning a medium-term rising dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:39:00">[58:39:00]</a>. China's currency is unlikely to become an international standard due to capital controls, questions over its long-term value, and its legal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:40:00">[59:40:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The liquidity cycle, which bottomed in late 2022, is expected to peak in late 2025, following a normal five to six-year pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>. While markets have already seen significant gains, there is still further upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>. A potential downturn in the cycle could occur if [[central_bank_policies_and_their_influence_on_global_markets|central banks]] attempt to tighten policy again by the end of next year, possibly due to stronger economic impetus or rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. Alternatively, governments might seek to sell debt more easily by driving investors out of equities and risk assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. Investment managers must focus on understanding debt refinancing and the recycling mechanisms of the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

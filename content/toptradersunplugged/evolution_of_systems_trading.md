In the early days of technical trading, the landscape was significantly different from today's environment, offering what one early practitioner described as "shooting fish in a barrel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. At that time, few people engaged in [[systematic_trading_systems | systems trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The majority of commodity traders were small investors or individuals trading "by the seat of their pants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The inherent discipline provided by a [[systematic_trading_systems | system]] offered an "incredible advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> over most other traders, to the extent that "almost any system would work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

However, the industry has since transformed, with [[systematic_trading_systems | systems traders]] now dominating the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, creating a "much different environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Foundations and Early Development

Bill Dryse, a pioneer in [[systematic_trading_systems | systems trading]], embarked on his career in the early 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. His background included degrees in electrical engineering from MIT and a focus on Bayesian decision theory and operations research at Harvard Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

After business school, Dryse worked at a think tank, where he was exposed to "state-of-the-art" computer modeling for tactical warfare, using powerful Air Force computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. It was here that a retired Air Force officer sparked his interest in commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He learned about Richard Donchian's work and began reading literature from figures like Edwards and McGee, leading him to experiment with developing [[systematic_trading_methods | systematic trading methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. These early ideas formed the basis for his first system in the late 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Initially, without computer access, Dryse's work was done by hand, analyzing CRB charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. His focus, influenced by Edwards and McGee, was on traditional technical analysis, such as trend lines and support/resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. He quickly found that many classical chart patterns like heads and shoulders or triangles were "meaningless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, with only trend lines and support/resistance proving useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This led him to develop a system that systematized certain aspects of technical analysis, using trend line breaks as signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### The Dawn of Computerization
The need to manage a growing client base (eventually 180 clients and $10 million under management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> spurred Dryse to acquire his first computer in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. He bought an Altair computer, primarily to automate the "nightmare" of accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. His accounting system became more accurate than the brokerage firms he dealt with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Subsequently, his [[systematic_trading_systems | trading system]] was also computerized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Evolution Towards Fractal Geometry

After a period where his business tapered off, leading him to trade only for his own account and focus on software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, Dryse was drawn back into [[systematic_trading_systems | systems trading]] by the work of Benoit Mandelbrot and fractal geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Mandelbrot's early work on the cotton market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> demonstrated the applicability of fractals to modeling markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Dryse and a colleague also considered the Elliott Wave theory, which is a "fractal kind of approach" with "patterns within patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. However, they found that Elliott Wave was too restrictive, as the market wouldn't "cooperate" with its imposed conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Instead, they opted to "devise a model that fit the data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

This led to the development of the **Fractal Wave Algorithm** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This algorithm deconstructs prices into a series of fractal patterns, which are "self similar across scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The basic underlying pattern is a "zigzag" (price up, price down, price up again) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. These zigzags can combine to form larger-scale zigzags, creating a fractal structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

Unlike Elliott Wave, which imposes a top-down judgment of fives and threes, the Fractal Wave Algorithm uses a bottom-up approach, building patterns directly from market price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. This allows for patterns of varying lengths (seven, nine, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>, as opposed to being restricted to fives and threes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

> [!info] Objective Turning Points
> The primary utility of the fractal wave algorithm is not prediction, but to "mechanically specify turning points on the crane the price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. These objectively identified turning points can then be used to draw trend lines, eliminating the subjectivity common in traditional technical analysis where "three technicians will draw the trend line in three different places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

## Theoretical Underpinnings and Market Behavior

The return to [[systematic_trading_systems | systems trading]] in 1991, with the new fractal wave system, was driven by a theoretical basis that challenged the prevailing efficient market hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. While academics argued that markets were random walks, Mandelbrot demonstrated that markets are "not random" but exhibit "persistence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. This means trends tend to persist longer than expected in a purely random walk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

> [!quote] Persistence in Markets
> "If you could demonstrate that persistence, which you can possible using Mandelbrot's mathematics or using the fractal mathematics or power law analysis, then you had in a sense a theoretical basis, a scientific basis for saying that the market that it was at least possible... to make money in the markets by some sort of a [[Systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following method]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

Dryse believes that underlying the statistics and mathematics of markets are fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. Commodity markets are driven by supply and demand, and financial markets by "long-term" economic forces related to business cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This perspective influenced his decision to trade very [[longterm_trading_systems | long term]], primarily off weekly charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. Trading longer term means less frequent trades, which reduces transaction costs and slippage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. It allows capturing the "whole thing" of a trend, rather than multiple short-term trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, and often results in better exits after pullbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

### Mechanical Execution
A core principle of Dryse's [[systematic_trading_systems | system]] is its purely mechanical nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. He runs the program daily and executes its instructions without "second-guessing" or omitting trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. The system provides discipline and eliminates the "bane of the technical analyst" â€“ subjective judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. The system has remained "virtually unchanged for the last 25 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, with adjustments primarily made to portfolio options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

## Parameterization and Risk Management

Dryse's [[systematic_trading_strategies | system]] design minimizes "data fitting" or parameter optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. Instead of optimizing numerical parameters, the fractal approach deals with "very fundamental patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a> derived from "qualitative judgments about how the markets work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. While choices like trading weekly charts vs. daily charts are made, they are based on qualitative criteria rather than extensive optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>.

> [!warning] Avoiding Delusion
> "The worst thing that comes from parameterization is you tend to think you've got something that's a lot more... magical than is actually the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.

Even though parameters exist in his system, they "fall out of the patterns that form," rather than being independently derived or optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. For example, a longer-scale zigzag's duration is typically about three times that of a shorter zigzag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>, leading to specific, consistent parameters like a "27-week pattern" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

Risk management, in Dryse's view, is "common sense" and driven by the "realities of the business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. While his leverage is towards the higher end among CTAs, he notes that most established CTAs operate within a similar "ballpark" of risk, showing consistent margin-to-equity ratios and standard deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:56">[00:44:56]</a>. He believes that the market itself provides the trading opportunities and returns more than any particular methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

## Operational Structure and Future Growth

Dryse has structured his business to allow for geographical independence, enabling him to live and work from anywhere, notably allowing him to pursue his passion for surfing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. He aims to be "as far from the markets as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a> to insulate himself from market psychology and opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>.

His current operations involve a "virtual office" with a remote trader and programmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. His [[systematic_trading_systems | trading system]] runs on a secure remote server with multiple backups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:15">[00:55:15]</a>. The daily operation of the system and back office takes minimal time (about half an hour a day and a couple of hours on weekends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.

Despite a long and successful track record, Dryse acknowledges that his marketing efforts have been less successful than his trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. He attributes this to reliance on "fickle" third-party marketers and the need to take more responsibility for his own marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>, similar to successful firms like [[evolution_of_dunn_capitals_trading_strategies | Dunn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>.

He notes that while sophisticated investors are comfortable with his lean operations, institutions increasingly require a "pink box oriented" approach with formal offices and numerous employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. However, his current setup has "huge unused capacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, capable of managing significantly larger assets under management (AUM) without major changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. He also outsources performance calculations to third parties like NAV, ensuring credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

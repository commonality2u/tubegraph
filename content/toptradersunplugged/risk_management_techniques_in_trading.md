> [!CAUTION] Investment Performance
> All discussions about investment performance refer to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or even infer anything about future performance. There is a significant [[understanding_and_managing_trading_risks | risk of financial loss]] with all investment strategies, and potential investors should request and understand the specific [[understanding_and_managing_trading_risks | risks]] from the investment manager about their product before making investment decisions [00:00:36].

Don Capital Management, a systematic trading firm, has evolved its [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] techniques over decades, emphasizing a data-driven approach to minimize downside while preserving upside potential [00:01:19].

## Early Approaches and Evolution
Initially, Bill Dunn, the founder of Don Capital, focused on using mathematical or statistical data to determine trading actions, with a philosophy based purely on price data [00:05:07]. The firm's [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] and portfolio development are considered key drivers of performance [00:38:14].

## Value at Risk (VAR) Targeting
The original WMA (World Monetary Asset) program was designed with a specific [[risk_management_in_trading | risk profile]] [00:12:11]. Don Capital targets Value at Risk (VAR), rather than just volatility [00:12:31].

> [!INFO] Original VAR Target
> Bill Dunn initially set the VAR target as a 1% chance of losing 20% or more in a given month [00:12:53]. This target was maintained for many years [00:13:00].

## Adaptive Risk Profile (ARP)
A significant [[risk_management_in_trading_strategies | risk management strategy]] upgrade occurred in January 2013, following a research project aimed at making the VAR target dynamic based on market conditions [00:13:08].

> [!NOTE] Proprietary Measure
> Don Capital developed a proprietary measure of the "trendiness" of the markets [00:13:24].
This allows them to change their VAR target daily based on market conditions [00:13:34]. This adaptive approach has led to a reduction in overall volatility, from the mid-30s to 23-24% [00:13:57]. The goal is to reduce drawdowns without sacrificing upside profitability [00:14:20].

The Adaptive [[risk_management_in_trading | Risk Profile]] (ARP) assesses whether it's a favorable environment for trend following [00:29:43]. The better the environment for trend following, the higher the VAR targeting mechanism is set [00:29:52]. Conversely, if the market's trendiness is low, the VAR target is adjusted lower [00:29:58]. This daily adjustment considers market volatilities and correlations for position sizing [00:29:30].

## Dynamic Risk Adjustment
In 2008, Don Capital implemented a dynamic [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]] adjustment system, which means they adjust their [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]] every day, rather than basing it on static historical data [00:24:29].

## Algorithm-Specific Risk Provisions
The firm uses two main algorithm classes, one of which includes a stop-loss provision [00:26:44]. This stop-loss function is not based on typical price movement losses but acts as a safeguard within the algo's logic [00:26:59].

## Daily Position Adjustment
Don Capital constantly monitors and adjusts its positions. At the end of each trading day, they determine the desired position given the latest market data [00:37:19]. They apply a small threshold to avoid excessive trading, but they adjust their positions daily [00:37:27].

## Portfolio Development and Diversification
A major shift in 2006 involved moving from an individual market-by-market trading system to designing models for the portfolio as a whole [00:21:37]. This made the systems much more robust [00:22:13]. The firm also expanded the number of markets traded, looking for regulated exchanges, high and consistent volume, and markets that are uncorrelated to their existing portfolio [00:31:35]. The 53 markets they trade cover all sectors, providing full diversification [00:31:15]. This diversification allows them to take on a little more [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]] sometimes due to the broader portfolio type [00:34:20]. Marty Bergen believes that their [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] and portfolio development are the primary reasons for their superior performance [00:38:14].

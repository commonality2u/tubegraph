The world of systematic investing, as explored in the Systematic Investor Series, frequently takes the pulse of global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor, often discussing the [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets|impact of interest rates on markets]] and their broad implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. A key theme has been what is termed "The Great Bond Repricing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Current Landscape: Central Bank Actions and Market Reactions

Recent weeks have been eventful, marked by several bank failures and continued interest rate hikes by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For instance, the Swiss National Bank hiked to 1.5%, the Bank of England to 4.25%, the ECB to 3.5%, and the Fed to between 4.75% and 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The process of increasing interest rates and engaging in Quantitative Tightening (QT) inherently involves removing liquidity from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. When the Fed raises rates at a historic pace, it inevitably leads to "something going to break somewhere," likened to playing Jenga and trying to remove a bottom piece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This environment suggests increased fragility in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Despite the rapid changes, the Fed has acted quickly and has been prepared for a banking run for a decade or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The Fed's objective has been to let "air out of this market" and manage volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## The Fed's Dilemma: Inflation vs. Crisis Management

Jerome Powell faces the challenge of potentially having to play both roles of "Slayer of inflation" (like Paul Volcker) and "crisis firefighter" (like Ben Bernanke), or being forced to choose between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The Fed's mandate to control inflation is complicated because their primary tool is cyclical, working against secular inflationary trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Volcker's success in tackling inflation was partly due to being at the end of a secular trend, a different scenario than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Bernanke, conversely, operated at a time of strong Federal Reserve dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. In the current environment, marked by populism and fiscal policy's influence, neither a Volcker-like forceful approach (which could cause a massive recession followed by more fiscal stimulus and inflation) nor a solely monetary policy approach (which is politically unpopular) is a winning solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The inflationary problem is structural and requires time to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The Fed's vocal attempts to "talk the market down" in early 2023 were initially met with market rallies, demonstrating the power of flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. However, once flows were removed, the market reacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. The banking issues led to a historic move in the yield curve, particularly in one-year and two-year Treasury rates, with a 1.75% move in a week or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This unexpected drop in mortgage rates due to the yield curve's movement is contrary to the Fed's desire to keep the longer end of the yield curve up to prevent stimulating the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Historical Context and Volatility

### [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates|Interest Rate Volatility]]
[[market_volatility_and_interest_rates|Volatility]], especially in the yield curve and fixed income markets, has been prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. This is partly due to the historic [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets|rise in interest rates]] not seen by most investors in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. Short-term moves in rates are reminiscent of the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

Interest rate volatility is expected to remain elevated, unlike in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The last time such moves were seen was in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the end of the last inflationary cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. This period (1968-1982) was highly volatile, marked by inflation, Fed actions, and three recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

### Cross-Asset Volatility (Gold, Oil, Equity Vol)
Analysis of different asset classes during various environments highlighted that interest rate volatility and FX volatility, which are highly connected, exploded last year and remain elevated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

Gold's volatility, especially long-dated gold calls, was considered significantly undervalued, leading to a massive run in gold prices and increased gold volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Conversely, oil volatility was considered overvalued and has since been "dead," reflecting resource scarcity and consistent demand, especially with China's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. Equity volatility has remained weak, which is typical for periods where markets nominally go nowhere, like 1968-1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

## Market Mechanics: Positioning and Liquidity

Market movements are largely a function of positioning and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. While macro narratives affect longer-term trends, day-to-day, week-to-week, or even annual moves are driven by positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

Many investors, especially those seeking "crisis strategies," entered volatility (Vol) funds expecting a safe haven, particularly in anticipation of crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. However, despite significant market events like historically high interest rates, war, and de-globalization, many Vol funds have lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>.

This phenomenon is explained by positioning:
*   **Over-hedging:** Before market liquidations, there was record hedging, particularly in S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. When the market liquidated, these hedges had to be monetized. If investors were leveraged long equities and long Vol as tail protection, they lost on both, leading to forced selling and "liquidation" of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
*   **Crowded Trades:** When a strategy appears easy and successful, people crowd into it, making dealer positioning bigger and increasing the effects of supply and demand imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Knowledge is Vol Dampening:** If people are aware of potential market events and broadly hedged, it's less likely for extreme volatility to occur immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:08">[00:37:08]</a>. The current narrative of a changing, uncertain world with de-globalization and risks means everyone is on alert, preparing and hedging, which makes it harder for long Vol strategies to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   **Shift in Hedging:** Investors have shifted from high beta equities hedged with Vol to lower beta equities, expecting less downside. This changes the distribution of outcomes from being "taken out of equity exposure" to simply losing less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

A major shift in positioning is the exposure to implied Vol. Currently, 45% of options volume is zero-day expiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>. This "gamma" strategy may cease to work as effectively, while "Vega" (implied Vol) might start creeping higher, leading to a more applied Vol-focused decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>.

## Loss of Confidence in Central Banks

A potential "Black Swan" event could be a loss of confidence in central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>. For 40 years, there has been a broad belief that the Fed can control the system and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. However, the Fed may eventually lose control of the long end of the curve, leading to higher volatility in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>.

When positioning becomes shorter in Vol products due to high costs, it opens the window for more extreme outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. A loss of confidence could accompany a second significant market downturn, as the Fed may struggle to resolve a stagflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>. This loss of confidence would be tied to the belief that the inflation problem is cyclical rather than secular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

## US Debt Ceiling Implications

The US debt ceiling debate is a significant upcoming event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. While it tends to be resolved at the last minute due to political incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, its resolution could have market consequences. The emergency funding policy, where the Treasury doesn't have to fill its coffers, has acted as a "secret QE" by reducing the supply of treasuries in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. Once an agreement is reached, a "bucket load of bonds" will need to be issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. This influx of supply could lead to supply-demand imbalances on the yield side, pushing yields higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.

## Broader Market Outlook

In the broader picture, the market trend is likely heading south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>. The previous mantra of "don't fight the Fed" when the Fed was selling puts and supporting markets is now reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. The tide is going out, and while cyclical "blips" may occur, they do not change the underlying secular trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>. The influence of government and fiscal policy is a new dominant entity in the market, changing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

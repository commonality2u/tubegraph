## Current Outlook on Inflation and Interest Rates

Recent Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data shows a declining trend in headline PCE, with core PCE month-over-month being below expectations, though year-on-year remains around 2.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. The prevailing message from [[the_federal_reserve_and_monetary_policy | the Federal Reserve]] (Fed) suggests that [[inflationary_pressures_and_macroeconomic_policy | inflation]] is no longer a major concern, and they are increasingly attentive to downside risks in the labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

Despite this, a "steepener" trend in the yield curve is observed, where long-term yields are rising even as short-term rates remain influenced by the Fed's stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. This indicates that the market might be anticipating a reflationary scenario as cyclical deflationary pressures are removed, allowing structural [[inflationary_pressures_and_macroeconomic_policy | inflationary pressures]] to re-ignite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. The "steepener" trade is considered profitable, acting as a "win-win" in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

## Cyclical vs. Structural Inflation

It is crucial to distinguish between cyclical and structural [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>:

*   **Cyclical Inflation** is driven by the business cycle, where economic expansion and high demand lead to [[inflationary_pressures_and_macroeconomic_policy | inflation]], and slowdowns lead to disinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. For about 40 years until 2020, the economy was in a structurally deflationary environment, making cyclical effects the primary driver of [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.
*   **Structural Inflation** reflects deeper, secular trends not tied to the immediate business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. The current period, starting around 2020, is seen as structurally inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>. This means that even if the Fed raises [[federal_reserves_interest_rate_policies | interest rates]] to slow the economy and reduce cyclical [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] in the short term, the underlying structural pressures remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>.

### Drivers of Structural Inflation

Historically, structural deflation was driven by:
*   **Federal Reserve Policy**: Monetary policy, such as keeping [[federal_reserves_interest_rate_policies | interest rates]] low (0% or declining), channeled money into asset markets and favored corporations and high-net-worth individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.
*   **Globalization**: Corporations sought profits globally, leading to increased free market economics and globalization, which was a major deflationary force for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Technological Development**: Companies invested in efficiency and automation, often replacing human labor, further contributing to deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.

However, the current shift towards structural [[inflationary_pressures_and_macroeconomic_policy | inflationary pressures]] is attributed to:
*   **Populism and Fiscal Spending**: A growing demand for fairness and maximized median outcomes, especially among younger generations and labor, has led to increased fiscal spending and wealth redistribution from the top to the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
*   **Deglobalization and Global Conflict**: A shift from cooperative to competitive global interactions, leading to deglobalization, scarcity of resources, and hoarding. This mirrors past periods like the OPEC crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Sequestered Demand**: High [[federal_reserves_interest_rate_policies | interest rates]] can sequester demand (e.g., for housing) that is released as soon as rates decline, causing rapid re-acceleration of the economy and [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. This has been seen repeatedly, often referred to as "transitory" [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] (currently "transitory 4.0") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.

## Election's Impact on Inflationary Pressures

The upcoming US election is a significant factor in [[factors_influencing_inflation_and_economic_forecasts | inflationary pressures]] and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Key [[factors_influencing_inflation_and_economic_forecasts | factors influencing inflation]] include fiscal policy, global conflict, labor costs, protectionism, and commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>.

### Trump vs. Harris Administrations

*   **Fiscal Policy**: A Trump administration is expected to be highly stimulative, focusing on supply-side policies like tax cuts (though less politically feasible now) and pressuring [[the_federal_reserve_and_monetary_policy | the Fed]] for short-term stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. This approach could lead to a "super hot" cyclical economy in the short term, but worsen long-term structural [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]], reminiscent of the Nixon era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. A Harris administration would also be structurally inflationary, potentially through taxing capital gains and wealth redistribution, leading to a more measured, yet still stagflationary, approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:54]</a>.
*   **Global Conflict (China)**: China's potential actions against Taiwan are a looming threat, with a 50% probability of a move in the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.
    *   Under **Trump**: A more isolationist stance and reduced deterrence against China could lead to quicker, more abrupt geopolitical action by China, potentially resolved sooner (within 1-3 years). This could eventually be bullish for Chinese assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
    *   Under **Harris**: A more traditional stance could delay Chinese action but potentially lead to a longer and larger global conflict if it occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>.
*   **Commodity Prices**: A Trump administration might be more inclined to negotiate with Saudi Arabia for oil stability, potentially leading to a *d√©tente* that could be less inflationary on commodity prices compared to a Harris administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
*   **Immigration**: This is considered a potentially significant [[factors_influencing_inflation_and_economic_forecasts | factor influencing inflation]]. Mass immigration has historically helped temper labor [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. A Hardline immigration policy under Trump, including border closures, could lead to significantly hotter labor [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] in the US and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.

### Post-Election Market Dynamics

Regardless of the election outcome, a period of structural positive flows is expected in the immediate aftermath due to the unwinding of high skew and event volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. However, this short-term boost may not negate longer-term structural issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

A Trump win is likely to result in Republican control of both the House and Senate, giving him significant power to implement policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. This complete "carte blanche" suggests more dramatic moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>. A Harris win might lead to a more mixed bag in Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>.

## Long-Term Market Implications

Historically, periods of populism and structural [[inflationary_pressures_and_macroeconomic_policy | inflation]] have been detrimental for equities and bonds, with the "60/40" portfolio strategy becoming problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>. For example, during a 14-year period (1968-1982) with rising [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates]], markets saw no real gains and lost 70% of their value in real terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>.

Paradoxically, populist election years during such periods have shown exceptionally strong market performance (average 21% gain, 100% winning percentage), far exceeding average election year returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. This is attributed to massive stimulus injected by the party in power to influence voters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

However, after these election-year "sugar highs," a significant retracement and decline are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>. The geopolitical "holding pattern" during an election year tends to dissipate, leading to renewed structural challenges and potential market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. A "blow-off top" followed by a decline is a common market pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>. The earliest this retracement might occur is around January, potentially signaling a dangerous period for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.

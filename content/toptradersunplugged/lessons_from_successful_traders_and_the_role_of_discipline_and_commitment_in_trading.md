"Top Traders Unplugged" offers insights from some of the world's leading hedge fund managers, providing valuable lessons for investment careers and manager due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It's important to remember that all discussions about investment performance relate to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Furthermore, significant risk of financial loss is inherent in all investment strategies, and specific risks should be understood from the investment manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

In a conversation with Jerry Parker, founder and president of Chesapeake Capital, several key themes emerge regarding the principles and challenges of successful trading, particularly within the systematic trend following approach.

## The Systematic Approach and Investor Perceptions
Many investors, especially around 2014, struggled to appreciate or understand systematic trend following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A common complaint was the lack of stock exposure, suggesting CTAs made a mistake by not offering stock-only funds or having a larger equity component in their diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Investors also tend to [[behavioral_finance_in_trading | desire complexity]] from their managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, for a trend-following approach like Chesapeake Capital's, over-optimizing or adding too much research can actually weaken the systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This contrasts with the general expectation that constant improvement means more complexity, similar to evolving technological gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Adding too many ways to prevent drawdowns can negatively impact money-making potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

CTAs are often underperforming the stock market index, leading to a lack of understanding regarding their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The core value of a hedge fund or CTA is its trailing stop, a plan to preserve capital when markets look weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Risk Parity
Jerry Parker emphasizes that [[the_importance_of_position_sizing_and_money_management_in_trading | position sizing]] and money management are fundamental, wonderful aspects of CTA strategies that are often underestimated by investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This approach is superior to what typical stock managers do and fits every portfolio type, whether stocks, stocks and bonds, or fully diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

While terms like "risk parity" have gained popularity due to successful hedge fund managers like Ray Dalio, Parker views it as essentially another name for what trend following has always done regarding position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. He cautions against advocating risk parity after a long bull market, as it's most needed when trades are first initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Key Questions for Systematic Traders
When evaluating systematic traders, Jerry Parker believes investors should ask:
*   **How do the systems work and what is the theory behind them?** This helps clients understand what to expect from the trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **What is your sample size of trades?** This was a foundational lesson in system development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. A 20-30 year backtest across many markets and environments should yield thousands of trades, providing a robust basis for the systematic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Parker highlights a dilemma for trend followers:
*   Adding variables to prevent losses or reduce drawdowns tends to lessen the sample size and weaken systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   [[understanding_and_managing_trading_risks | Eliminating drawdowns]] or aiming for a winning percentage higher than the low 40s makes systems less robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. He seldom gets questions about sample size, suggesting a gap in investor understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## The Role of Discipline and Commitment in Trading
[[the_role_of_discipline_and_systematic_methods_in_trading | Discipline and commitment]] are repeatedly emphasized as crucial for success in trading.

### Handling Drawdowns
Jerry Parker admits that handling emotions during drawdowns is not easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. His approach includes:
*   **Stopping daily market price watching**: He stopped doing this about 10 years prior to the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Commitment to the process**: Sticking to the systematic approach and doing the right thing on every trade is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. While slight improvements are fine, the core focus is adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Accepting discomfort**: Traders must be willing to "suffer pain" and "do what most people find hard to do," which is to stick to a game plan even when it's not going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Division of duties**: Having one group devise systems and create trades, and another carry them out, acts as a great internal control for a more disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Richard Dennis, Parker's mentor, taught that traders are graded on following systems and doing the right thing. Losing money while adhering to the rules is acceptable; making money by breaking them is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Consistency and Adherence
Parker is deeply committed to his systematic approach, believing it is the best and safest way to manage money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. He has learned through negative experiences that maintaining 100% consistency and discipline in systems is more important than creating "better" systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Even a "substandard" system will yield better results if followed consistently than if guessed at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.

> "If you have a substandard system... you'll be better off just following it and not trying to guess." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>

He is surprised that people don't believe in following price and are convinced they can predict markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. His firm remains very close to the philosophical approach taught by Richard Dennis and Bill Eckhart, focusing on the concepts of what works in markets rather than specific parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

### Evolution of Trend Following and its Challenges
Markets have changed, leading to a shift towards longer-term trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Markets are choppier, hitting 50-day or 75-day lows more often before returning to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This means staying in trends for longer periods, even if it leads to giving back more profits at the peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Multiple exits are mandatory to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

The increased number of trend followers and computers contribute to market choppiness, making it progressively harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This requires traders to have the "stomach to sit through drawdowns" bigger than those in the 80s and 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

[[the_importance_of_position_sizing_and_money_management_in_trading | Diversification]] is always important, as it minimizes downside and volatility, even if markets are correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Parker differentiates between losing capital (which he is very conservative about, risking perhaps 50 basis points per trade) and giving back open profits from a large winning trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Attempting to tighten stops to preserve profits too much often cuts profits short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

> "The risk is what I'm willing to risk on a certain trade... but if I have a big open trade profit... I'll be much more liberal with that profit and let and my systems are going to not get me out of there and make a big distinction between losing capital and losing back open profits." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>

### The Core of Success: Unwavering Commitment
To become a great trader, one needs to:
*   **Commit to a systematic approach**: Use objective information, like that offered by trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>.
*   **Commit to executing trades**: Do not be swayed by others, clients, or internal doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. Avoid "seat of the pants" trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.
*   **Avoid over-optimization**: Trying to make systems "too good" leads to issues with sample size and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. "Good enough should be good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
*   **Accept losses and drawdowns**: These are integral parts of a winning system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. "A winning system has to be hard, it has to be difficult. Do not seek out ease, comfort, and pleasure; if it feels good, it's probably wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.
*   **Avoid jealousy**: Poor ideas can have good performance for extended periods, so sticking to what is known to be right is indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>.
*   **Play for the long term**: Give clients a good product with reasonable leverage and expenses, and grow slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Love your systems and your losses**: These are part of the process that yields profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.
*   **The biggest failing is not entering trades**: Traders often hesitate after a string of losses or use filters that prevent them from participating in big trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. Filters, while seemingly optimizing, can cause one to miss the "greatest trade of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:53">[00:51:53]</a>.

> "The biggest failing of all Traders and certainly mine is not entering a trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>

## Personal Philosophy and Legacy
Jerry Parker's personality "craves rules" and seeks to understand the underlying principles of what works in life, including trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. He aims to have "Ten Commandments" for various aspects of his life, which guide his evaluation of specific ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. This fundamental desire for an overriding philosophy makes it "easy to be Trend following plus nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. He stresses the importance of not desiring the approval of others and staying true to oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

The legacy of the Turtle experiment, which Jerry Parker participated in, taught him irreplaceable, life-altering lessons from mentors like Richard Dennis and Bill Eckhart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. Parker's personal contribution will be his unwavering commitment to sticking with what he was taught, with only minor adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. He believes there are "no good alternatives" to trend following, and adding other components like counter-trend or small-profit ideas are not replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.

> "I will be the last one going down with the trend following ship... because I don't think that there's any alternative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>

## Improving the Industry
Parker believes the CTA industry has made mistakes, such as using too much leverage, having high fees and expenses, and not offering a meaningful equity component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:28">[01:11:28]</a>. The marketing strategy of showing how managed futures improve traditional investments by reducing risk without harming returns has failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:44">[01:11:44]</a>. Strategies need to stand alone as worthy investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

He suggests that every CTA should offer a stock trend-following fund to appeal to a wider audience, as "trend following does not equal managed futures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. It's a method applicable to any market, not just commodities or currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. The industry has missed a huge opportunity by not integrating better with the stock world and momentum trading discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.

The fundamental question separating different trading camps is whether it's possible to predict the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Since most people agree that prediction is not possible, simply following price, taking small losses, being diversified, and letting profits run on any market is the safest and best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. This also involves [[the_importance_of_research_and_adaptation_in_shortterm_trading | adapting systems]] to market changes like choppiness or violent sell-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

Ultimately, successful trading hinges on:
*   Following [[the_importance_of_simple_and_objective_trading_rules | objective trading rules]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>.
*   Unwavering commitment to that system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
*   Embracing losses and drawdowns as natural parts of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   Prioritizing market diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:20">[02:11:20]</a>.
*   Understanding the crucial role of position sizing and money management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Having the [[importance_of_psychological_resilience_in_trading | psychological resilience]] to stick to the plan even when it's difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

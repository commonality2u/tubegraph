A new global order is emerging, driven by significant macroeconomic trends and [[geopolitical_challenges_and_global_macroeconomic_trends | geopolitical challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>. Experts are engaged in deeper analysis to understand the future landscape of this global macro-driven world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:36">[01:58:36]</a>. Simon Hunt, an expert with extensive experience in regions currently challenging Western perspectives, offers insights into these unfolding events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:51">[02:11:51]</a>.

## Simon Hunt's Analytical Approach

Simon Hunt's analysis often leads to contrarian calls that have largely proven correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:35">[04:19:35]</a>. His methodology for formulating forecasts is multi-faceted, incorporating several key factors:
*   **Debt Levels** Debt has been central to his thinking since the 1970s, tracking how levels have continuously risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:51">[07:39:51]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Actions** He closely observes the policies and actions of central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Global Network** Information from a worldwide network of friends and contacts with various disciplines feeds into his analytical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>.
*   **Technical Analysis** For timing and the extent of turning points, he collaborates closely with a technical associate from Wave Track International <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:20">[08:22:20]</a>.
*   **Cycles** Hunt extensively incorporates various cycles into his forecasts, including:
    *   Long-term Kondratieff cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a>
    *   Shorter business cycles, which fit into the long-term cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:08">[10:08:08]</a>
    *   Weather cycles, driven by sunspot activity, volcanic activity, and changes in ocean temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:41">[10:29:41]</a>.

## Current Global Macro View

The world is currently facing a "troubled world" scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:05">[04:29:05]</a>. This is attributed to a combination of an escalating war in Europe and a highly leveraged global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. These factors are expected to lead to significant challenges over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### Geopolitical Landscape

The war in Ukraine is seen as a proxy conflict between Russia and NATO, with a high risk of intensifying and spreading beyond Ukrainian borders by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:35">[14:16:35]</a>. Hunt believes this is effectively World War III, not confined to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:37">[21:07:37]</a>.

*   **Taiwan and China**: China is believed to have no desire to invade or blockade Taiwan but could be forced into action if the U.S. crosses a "red line," such as supporting a Taiwanese independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. Business ties between Taiwan and mainland China remain strong, with approximately a million Taiwanese working on the mainland and Taiwan being the largest investor in China since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:00">[26:41:00]</a>.
*   **Semiconductors**: A Chinese move on Taiwan could knock out TSMC, a major semiconductor company, impacting its 500 suppliers and potentially affecting America more than China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>. Recent U.S. policies to curtail China's growth in semiconductors are viewed by Beijing as an economic war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.
*   **Middle East**: Events in Syria and their potential expansion into Iran should be closely monitored, as this could create volatile periods for oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.

### Climate and Economic Impact

Climate operates in long-term cycles of 40 to 70 years, driven by sunspot activity, volcanic activity, and ocean temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:26">[10:30:26]</a>.

*   **Cooling Cycle**: The world is in the process of moving out of a 40-year warming period into a 40 to 70-year cooling period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. NOAA and NASA had indicated in a September 2020 blog (since withdrawn) that a full-blown cold cycle could begin as soon as 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:26">[11:24:26]</a>. This cooling weather allows oceans to absorb excess CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Implications for Energy**: This shift raises questions about the long-term viability of significant investments in Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Renewables, especially if natural cooling occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
*   **Food Inflation and Drought**: A cooling cycle has massive implications for potential food inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. The extra grain production over the last 20 years has been aided by warmer weather and longer growing seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Droughts in 2022 across the world were linked to an underwater volcanic eruption at Tonga, which spewed vapor into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.
*   **Gleissberg Cycle**: Around 2025, the 90-year Gleissberg cycle, a drought cycle, is expected to hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. This cycle caused the Dust Bowl in the U.S. Midwest in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. Combined with ongoing war-related disruptions to fertilizer and grain exports from Russia and Ukraine, this could lead to [[future_economic_challenges_and_crises | extreme increases in food prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. The FAO food price index, averaging 95 in 2019 and 147 year-to-date in 2022, is projected to rise to 185 by 2024 and 220 by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>. This will lead to soaring poverty in many parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.

### Financial System Fragility and Forecasts

The [[global_financial_stability_risks | Global Financial System]] is highly leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. Central bank tightening of credit and rising interest rates are expected to cause severe pain in the "undergrowth" of the global credit system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.

*   **Central Bank Pivot**: Pockets of financial implosions are anticipated to force central banks to reverse course within the next three months (from late 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. Instead of tightening, they will be compelled to inject liquidity into the system to prevent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>.
*   **Resurgence of Inflation**: This pivot will lead to a resurgence of inflation, accompanied by significant increases in energy and food prices over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.
*   **U.S. Treasury Yields**: The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is projected to exceed 11% by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. This rise in yields will likely cause large parts of the highly leveraged global financial system to implode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:20:00">[19:20:00]</a>. U.S. CPI is expected to surpass the 1980 figure of 13.5%, making an 11% yield potentially conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a>. Central banks can only control the short end of the curve; the market controls the long end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>.
*   **Depression Era**: The combination of these factors, with the war ongoing, is expected to lead to a depression akin to that experienced between 1929 and 1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

### Key Market Outlooks

*   **Equity Markets**: A bear market rally is currently underway (as of Q4 2022), but it is expected to peter out by year-end, leading to significant falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. The S&P 500 is projected to fall below 3,000 in Q1 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a>. However, from spring 2023 to mid or end 2024, a "last hurrah" in equity markets is predicted, with parabolic rises leading to new all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>. This will then be followed by crashes akin to those of 1929-1932, as the world moves into a depression era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>.
*   **Currencies**:
    *   **U.S. Dollar**: The dollar is expected to come off its perch as central banks shift from tightening to loosening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. The dollar index is predicted to halve in value between 2022 and 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Other Currencies**: The Euro, Pound Sterling, Ruble, and Chinese Yuan are expected to see big rises by mid-2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>. The UAE's Dirham is a currency to watch due to oil trade; it may decouple from the U.S. dollar when oil sales begin in other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>.
    *   **New Currency**: The emergence of a new currency backed by 20 commodities, valued in grams of gold rather than dollars, is being developed by BRICS+, SCO, and EAEU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:15:00">[32:15:00]</a>. This signifies a large part of the world moving away from the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>.
*   **Commodities**: This period is not a commodity supercycle but a normal business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Oil**: The average oil price is projected to be $107 in 2022, rising to $130 in 2023 and $170 in 2024, driven by modest world recovery, inflation, and supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Copper**: A short-term bear market rally could take copper to $8,700 before the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>. It is then expected to fall to $6,000 in Q1 2023, aligning with falling equity markets and weak physical consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:00">[38:05:00]</a>. After this, a combination of inflation, a falling dollar, recovering consumption, inventory replenishment, and financial institutions seeking hedges could drive copper to a peak of around $14,000 by the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>. Prices are then expected to collapse during the depression years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:14:00">[39:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Gold**: Gold will reflect the real value of everything and be bought and held amidst rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>. A large part of the world will revert to a de facto gold standard, with commodities valued in grams of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. Gold prices in Yen, Euro, or Pound Sterling terms have already risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>.

### Demographic Pressures
China faces significant demographic challenges, notably a declining ratio of employed people to retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>. In 1990, there were 14 employed people per retiree; by 2040, this is projected to fall to just four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>. This trend underlies the Chinese leadership's focus on technology, productivity, and robotics to sustain growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

## Strategic Insights

In this volatile environment, Simon Hunt emphasizes his role as a strategist who continuously monitors data points ("dots") to determine if his forecasts remain on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>.

### Key Concerns

Hunt's primary concerns are the financial danger of the world and "warmongering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29:00">[45:29:00]</a>. He is particularly worried about attempts by the "Davos crowd" to reshape the world, believing they may have influenced governments but not the people, who have begun to rebel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:43:00">[45:43:00]</a>. He predicts they will fail in their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>.

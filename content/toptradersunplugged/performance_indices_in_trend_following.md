Understanding and comparing performance indices is crucial in [[Systematic trend following strategies and performance | systematic investing]], particularly within [[Trend Following Basics | trend following]]. Several prominent indices track the performance of managed futures and [[Trend following strategies | trend following]] strategies, each with distinct criteria and construction methodologies.

## SG Trend Index

The SG Trend Index, also known as the Society General Trend Index, is a widely recognized index that focuses on the largest [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors) trading in the managed futures space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.

### Inclusion Criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>
*   Primarily trades futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>.
*   Broadly diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.
*   Recognized as a [[Trendfollowing Strategies | trend follower]] by Society General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.
*   Exhibits significant correlation to [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] peers, classifying them as a distinct group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>.
*   Open to new investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.
*   Reports returns on a daily basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

### Construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>
*   An equally weighted index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   Rebalanced annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   Reconstituted annually based on changes in the top 10 largest CTAs by assets under management who meet the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

### Recent Performance
As of May 2022, the SG Trend Index was down 32 basis points, but up 25.58% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>.

## B Top 50 Index

The B Top 50 Index also focuses on large managers within the managed futures space, though its name can be misleading as it currently includes fewer than 50 constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>. As of 2022, it comprised only 20 programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>.

### Inclusion Criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>
*   Focuses on the largest investable trading advisor programs by assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>.
*   Requires at least three years of operating history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.
*   Requires at least two years of trading activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>.
*   The constituents may not be exclusively [[Trend following strategies | trend following]] managers; some might be highly specialized, such as a natural gas trader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.

### Construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:54">[01:08:54]</a>
*   The portfolio is equally weighted at the beginning of each calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>.

### Recent Performance
In May 2022, the B Top 50 Index was up 48 basis points, with a year-to-date performance of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

## TTU Trend Following Index

The TTU Trend Following Index was created to offer an alternative perspective, focusing on the quality and longevity of [[Risk Management in Trend Following | trend following]] programs rather than just their size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>.

### Inclusion Criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>
*   Possesses at least a 15-year unbroken track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>.
*   Must be geographically diversified across a broad array of asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.
*   Must be fully systematic in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:03">[01:11:03]</a>.
*   Adopts [[Trend Following Strategies | trend following strategies]] as its dominant investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.
*   Must be currently investable programs and active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>.
*   Reports on at least a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:25">[01:11:25]</a>.
*   Information is drawn from the Nielsen Hedge database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a>.

### Construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>
*   Equally weighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:38">[01:11:38]</a>.
*   Rebalanced and reconstituted monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:45">[01:11:45]</a>.
*   Has an inception date of January 1, 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   As of April 30, 2022, it included 60 programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:57">[01:11:57]</a>.

### Performance and Implications
The TTU [[Trend Following in investment portfolios | Trend Following]] Index aims to represent an "allocation method" for a theoretical unlimited fund, demonstrating the power of broad diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:13">[01:14:13]</a>. It significantly outshines both the B Top 50 and SG Trend indices in terms of Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) and drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

*   **CAGR:** Approximately 8.57% since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>.
*   **Maximum Drawdown:** Only 18% since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:03]</a>.

For comparison, the S&P 500 had a CAGR of around 6.5% with a 50% drawdown over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. This highlights that a validated, long-term track record serves as the most effective risk metric, and investing in a diversified ensemble of these programs can yield optimal risk-weighted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The index also represents massive diversification of systematic methodologies, as each program has its own distinct approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.

## Other Benchmarks

Other indices and market benchmarks often referred to include:
*   **SG Short-Term Traders Index:** Up 82 basis points in May 2022, and up 9.5% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>.
*   **MSCI World Index:** Down 16 basis points in May 2022, and down 13.64% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:21">[01:20:21]</a>.
*   **World Government Bonds:** Down 71 basis points in May 2022, and down approximately 8.2% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **S&P 500:** Was flat in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:38">[01:20:38]</a>.

These comparisons emphasize that different index constructions lead to varying performance insights. It's important to understand the underlying composition and rules when evaluating them.The user wants an Obsidian-flavored Markdown article about "Performance Indices in Trend Following."

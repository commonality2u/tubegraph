The current US administration is facing a challenging [[economic_resilience_and_macroeconomic_outlook | macroeconomic outlook]] marked by stagflationary pressures. Their strategy aims to address this by reducing demand and promoting supply-side economics, which carries significant [[potential_us_recession_predictions | potential recession risks]] and has implications for the [[global_economic_outlook_and_recession_risks | global economic outlook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>.

## Current US Economic Strategy

### Addressing Stagflation
The administration recognizes a "stagflationary setup" with inflation breaking out and the 10-year Treasury yield rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:15">[01:10:15]</a>. Their immediate priority is to get demand down and bring the 10-year yield under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

### Fiscal Policy Changes
The administration intends to achieve its goals by taking money away from people at the bottom and implementing supply-side economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. This approach is likened to Reagan-era policies, aiming to reduce inflation by sending money to the top, where it is believed to be less inflationary and more asset-inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>.

Specific cuts in the budget, intended to reduce demand, include:
*   Shutting down SNAP payments (food assistance for the poor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:35">[01:36:35]</a>.
*   Cutting support for poor housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   Removing school lunches from public schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   Cutting Medicaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   Reducing government workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

In addition to budget cuts, the administration has stopped all payments to Ukraine, which previously benefited US contractors, further reducing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

Stimulus measures, focused on the supply side, include:
*   Continuing massive tax cuts for corporations, with 90% of those cuts benefiting corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
*   Reducing regulation, including cuts to the IRS and tax oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   Thinning out Consumer Financial Protections and removing regulations related to beneficial ownership disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Monetary Policy and the Fed
The administration aims to engineer a decline in markets and the economy to force the Federal Reserve (Fed) to implement Quantitative Easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It is expected that Quantitative Tightening (QT) will stop around March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>, with QE potentially returning in 3 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

### Refinancing Bubble and Liquidity
A significant refinancing bubble is expected to begin in about three to six months, stemming from the five-year anniversary of low interest rates. This will lead to a massive bubble of refinancing and capital coming to market through venture capital, private equity, and commercial real estate, which will further affect liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Potential Risks and Outcomes

### Timing Discrepancy
A major challenge for the current policy is the different timelines for demand removal and supply-side benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:27">[01:26:27]</a>. Demand cuts, such as withdrawing government checks, have an immediate effect, leading to a dramatic reduction in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. GDP expectations for the first quarter in the US have already shifted from 3.5% positive to almost 3% negative in two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. In contrast, supply-side economics takes time to show results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This timing gap could lead to a deeper and quicker recession than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

### Dollar's Role
The administration's desire for a strong dollar is seen as a "Achilles' heel" for their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Austerity measures combined with QE typically correlate with a weaker currency. If the US economy goes into a freefall while the rest of the world holds steady, and the US responds with QE and lower interest rates, it would naturally lead to a weaker dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This could make it difficult to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Historical Precedent (Nixon)
The current situation is compared to the Nixon administration in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Nixon, a Republican, also pursued supply-side economics, opening up China and initiating the original QE by ending the Bretton Woods system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. However, Nixon's policies occurred during an existing recession, so he did not have to slow demand as aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. That period ended in price controls, Watergate, and growing public anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Political Ramifications
The shift to supply-side economics is seen as the "opposite of populist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. While social issues might distract for a time, the 52/48 political divide in the US could become a problem when people realize that services are being dismantled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. Populist rhetoric responded to with anti-populist policies may only increase public anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The market is also expected to become a check on the administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Market Outlook and Recession Severity
Two potential short-term paths are envisioned, both leading to challenging market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>:
1.  **Deeper Recession Scenario**: The 10-year yield continues to fall as US GDP declines more than expected. QE might not be aggressive enough, leading to markets fading due to a deeper and quicker recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Yield Surge Scenario**: Markets and the economy decline as planned, leading to aggressive QE. However, this coincides with the large refinancing period, causing the 10-year yield to quickly rise back above 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This would be worse for markets, leading to an initial rally followed by a deeper decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

It is predicted that a significant market decline, beyond a typical 10-20% correction, is likely within the next 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## Speculative Measures: Debt Jubilee
There is speculation about a "Malos Accord" that could replace the Bretton Woods Accord, involving allied nations buying 100-year US bonds with zero interest to reduce the US current account deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. While seen as unlikely due to potential political unpopularity in Europe and global resistance to US bullying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, it points towards the possibility of a "debt Jubilee" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This could take the form of the US monetizing its debt, similar to what Japan has done by having its central bank buy and effectively "cancel" debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. The US, with its significant portion of internal debt, could potentially cancel 73% of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Investment Implications
The [[impact_of_us_fiscal_and_monetary_policy_on_recession | US economic outlook and presidential election implications]] could influence specific investments. For example, Nvidia's stock performance is linked to this uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. The potential for a market decline and liquidity issues could significantly impact its growth expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Furthermore, a major event in Taiwan could create a "big dip" for the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

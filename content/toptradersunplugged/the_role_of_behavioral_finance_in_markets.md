Behavior, or [[behavioral_finance_in_trading | behavioral finance]], is considered a compelling and enduring reason why markets trend, standing the test of time alongside factors like information diffusion and the auto-correlation of market drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This [[cognitive_biases_in_trading and investing | behavioral phenomenon]] has been observed in price data dating back 5,000 years to ancient Sumeria, where wheat prices showed auto-correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Behavioral Explanations for Market Trends
The persistence of trends in financial markets can be attributed to inherent human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>:
*   **Holding for Better Prices**: When prices are rising, individuals are often inclined to wait for even higher prices before selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Selling on Dips**: Conversely, when prices are falling, there's a tendency to accept the first offer to mitigate further losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
These actions contribute to prices continuing in their established direction, creating trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Behavioral Aspects in Strategy Design
While [[behavioral_finance_in_trading | behavioral factors]] are a primary driver for trend-following strategies, other strategies exploit different types of market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>:
*   **Liquidity Inefficiency**: Some strategies target inefficiencies related to trading or liquidity, such as when demand for an asset doesn't justify the price moves, leading to price reversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Information Inefficiency**: Fundamental strategies often aim to exploit situations where a piece of information is not yet fully reflected in an asset's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Impact of Behavioral Dynamics on Market Performance
The impact of [[behavioral_biases_and_investment_strategies | behavioral biases]] in markets can be significant. For instance, an influx of trend followers into a system can:
*   Potentially *over-extend* a trend by pushing prices up further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
*   Worsen reversals as many participants exit positions simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>.

Despite the fundamental nature of [[cognitive_biases_in_trading_and_investing | behavioral biases]], market trends can still struggle in certain periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. For example, during the 2010s, liquid markets experienced weaker trends, not because reversals became worse, but because factors like central bank actions and loose monetary policy compressed [[importance_of_volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] and increased market correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>. This environment was less conducive to a positive convexity strategy like trend following, which benefits from lower correlation and movement in many markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>.

The dynamic between the United States and China is a critical factor in global markets and geopolitics, evolving rapidly with significant implications for trade, investment, and international stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This relationship has seen shifts from competitive trade to a more adversarial stance, prompting strategic responses from both sides.

## The Genesis of Modern Tensions

A pivotal moment in recent [[USChina relations and trade policies | US-China relations]] occurred in 2018 when the US government announced it would no longer sell semiconductors to China and restricted semiconductor equipment makers from selling into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. This decision "freaked China's policymakers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>, leading them to believe that similar restrictions could extend to other critical sectors like chemical products, auto parts, or industrial robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

> [!info] The Seed of Self-Sufficiency
> "We planted that Seed where China basically needed to have its own industrial supply chain for everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

China's response was a strategic pivot towards industrial self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. From 2018 onwards, a clear message was given to banks to stop lending to real estate and instead direct all loans to industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This policy shift led to a surge in industrial loans and a collapse in real estate loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

## Trade Wars and Global Impact

Five to six years later, this industrial shift has resulted in China producing goods that are "at least as good if not better" than those from the Western world, often at 70% of the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This "China's deflationary impact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a> has led to two main responses from policymakers globally:

1.  **Protectionism (Western World):** Countries like the US, Canada, and Europe are imposing tariffs to protect their industries from perceived "overcapacity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This approach signifies a refusal to accept China's deflationary impact, particularly in high-value goods like cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. This refusal is expected to lead to "higher structural inflation" in these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.
2.  **Embracement (Emerging Markets):** Countries in the developing world, such as South Africa, Indonesia, Chile, Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico, are embracing China's deflationary impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. China is facilitating their industrialization by providing very cheap machinery and credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. This helps "millions of workers out of the country sides... and into the industrial economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. For investors, this suggests that bonds in these emerging markets may be more attractive than those in the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

## Currency Dynamics and Global Capital Flow

A fascinating development is the strengthening of the Chinese Renminbi (RMB) even as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) cuts rates and announces stimulus measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This is significant because Chinese policymakers prioritize the value of their currency, needing it to be strong to "dollarize their economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. As long as stimulus leads to RMB appreciation, they will likely continue these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

The rally in the RMB is primarily driven by Chinese capital being repatriated, rather than an immediate influx of foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Foreign investors were previously trying to cut back on their exposure to China, with many firms launching "Emerging Markets X China funds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

> [!tip] Capital Reallocation
> The "anomaly in the world" today is that the US, with 4% of global population and 20% of global GDP, accounts for 70% of the world's MSCI index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. This suggests that "money coming out of the US and going into these other markets that are stabilizing and picking up" is a likely future trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.

Historically, the US dollar's strength has attracted capital to US assets, particularly a handful of large tech stocks like Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon, which served as "receptacles for the excess dollars in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. However, with the US dollar potentially no longer appreciating, investors may start to reallocate capital from US assets to more undervalued markets like Tencent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

## The US Election and Future Geopolitical Landscape

The upcoming US election, with polls showing a 50/50 split, indicates a potential Trump victory based on his historical outperformance in swing states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. A common perception is that a Trump win would lead to a "further deterioration in China US relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.

However, a different perspective suggests that a new Trump administration might see an improvement in the [[USChina relations and trade policies | US-China relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. This is attributed to:
*   **Different Advisors:** Trump's current circle includes figures like Elon Musk, Bobby Kennedy, and Tulsi Gabbard, who are described as "far less abrasive with the rest of the world" and "far more isolationist" compared to the neoconservative advisors of his previous term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.
*   **Shift in Narrative:** Trump has explicitly stated on the campaign trail that China is a "competitor," not an "enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>.
*   **Deal-Making Focus:** Trump's desire to find a solution for the Ukraine war could necessitate bringing China on board to pressure Russia for a deal that Ukraine can accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This would align with his self-image as a dealmaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

### [[Chinas geopolitical moves and Taiwan | Taiwan]]'s Position

Under a potential Trump presidency, the US is unlikely to go to war to defend Taiwan, as there is no treaty obligation to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. However, this does not automatically imply a Chinese invasion of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. Key factors include:
*   **Natural Fortress:** Taiwan is a "natural Fortress" with limited landing points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.
*   **High Costs:** A military move would result in "heavy casualty count both economically and in terms" for China, as most major Chinese cities are within reach of Taiwanese missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Urgency:** There isn't the same "hatred" or "sense of urgency" as seen between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
*   **Taiwanese Parliament:** Two-thirds of Taiwan's parliament is currently anti-independence, making a declaration of independence unlikely in the next four and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>.
*   **Red Lines:** China's red lines are Taiwan declaring independence or developing nuclear weapons, neither of which Taiwan is pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

Therefore, the status quo regarding Taiwan is expected to remain stable for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

### Currency Tensions and a Potential Plaza Accord

A Trump administration is expected to exert "a lot of pressures" on Japan and China to revalue their currencies, viewing them as "frankly too cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. This could lead to a situation similar to the 1980s Plaza Accord, where the US dollar was significantly driven down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>.

> [!quote] A Weaker Dollar and Reflation
> "A weaker dollar is very reflationary very you know very reflation for Commodities very reflationary for emerging markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

The US has incentives to offer China, such as resuming semiconductor sales, reducing visits to Taiwan, or stopping high-end weapon sales, to encourage China's cooperation on currency revaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. If a new Plaza Accord occurs, leading to a weaker US dollar, "all risk assets will absolutely rip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. However, this could also lead to a "much deeper US yield curve," with long-term yields potentially reaching five and a half to six percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>.

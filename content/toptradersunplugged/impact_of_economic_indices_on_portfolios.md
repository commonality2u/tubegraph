The Systematic Investor Series frequently analyzes global markets through the lens of rules-based investing, focusing on how various economic indices and shifts influence diversified portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Recent Market Developments and Their Impact

The week's headlines were dominated by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the FTX crypto exchange event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Consumer Price Index (CPI)

The US saw a welcome downward bias in the Consumer Price Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. While inflation numbers remain high, the rate of increase is falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Core CPI (excluding food and energy)**: Rose 6.3% year-on-year, down from 6.6% the previous month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Month-over-month, it rose 0.3%, down from 0.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This improvement comes as monetary policy tightening has reversed the "rising tide floats all boats" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Equity Market Performance

Equities had been under selling pressure for most of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Fang Stocks**: All were down double digits in 2022, with Meta (Facebook's parent) down 69% from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Apple was the "best performing" with a 27% year-to-date loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Dow Jones Index**: The "boring" Dow Jones index was nearing a new all-time high, needing only another percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. By the time of recording, it was only about 8% away from its all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Bond Market and Interest Rate Expectations

The impact of better-than-expected CPI on markets was swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Treasury Curve**: Substantial selling pressure occurred on the front end of the treasury curve since the hawkish FOMC meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The two-year note touched 4.72 on Monday as traders expected another 75 basis points hike in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Minutes after the CPI print, bearishness evaporated, and the two-year note finished the week around 4.33 as traders recalibrated [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | rate hike expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Inflation Outlook**: This CPI print felt like "the beginning of the end for inflation," but market reactions like this often occur in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The focus might shift from inflation to corporate earnings and deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Crypto Market

Bitcoin, a darling of sophisticated retail investors, was down about 76% since last December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The collapse of a well-known crypto exchange served as a reminder that high returns come with high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Rich Brennan capitalized on this by being short Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Portfolio Adjustments and Performance

The week was busy with significant portfolio movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Turbulence**: Richard Brennan experienced a turbulent period, with his "battleship" portfolio getting hammered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He had been riding powerful long-term trends in Yen pairs (Swiss Yen, USD Yen) but saw significant give back of unrealized equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Risk Management**: Rich manages his portfolio by accepting that drawdowns are part of the game, especially after a spectacular year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. His systems utilize trailing stops as "risk release valves" to prevent severe losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. His portfolio "degassed," losing about 25% of its positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Trend Following Losses**: When the outlook for inflation changes, as it did this week, and it has been the dominant driver, the direction of many trends will change, leading to losses for trend followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. These are typically "give backs" of open profits that are well in proportion to profits generated earlier in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Specific Market Impacts**:
    *   **Currencies**: The Yen and Swiss Franc rallied 6% against the dollar, leading to significant losses for those short these currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
    *   **Equities**: Most trend followers were short equities, which was another source of give back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
    *   **Fixed Income**: Longer-term trend followers would likely be short the entire gamut of fixed income, leading to losses in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   **Energy Markets**: Sold off, with managers' positions (long/short) depending on their look-back periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   **Metals**: Moved higher, and many trend followers were likely short these markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Trend Barometer**: The trend barometer was weakening during the week, finishing at 30 (weak), indicating expected losses for trend followers for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Index Performance (as of Thursday)**:
    *   Beta 50: Down 2.13% for the month, still up 13.7% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
    *   Stockton CTA Index: Down 2.6% for the month, up 23.36% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
    *   Trend Index: Down roughly 3% for the month, up 31.5% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   Short-term Traders Index: Down 0.4%, up 12% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   MSCI World: Up almost 5% for the month, down 17% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
    *   World Government Bond Index: Up 80 basis points for the month, but "still way in the red for the year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
    *   S&P Total Return Index: Down about 1% for the month, down 19.68% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Portfolio Management Discussions

### Position Sizing and Look-Back Periods

The podcast emphasized the critical importance of position sizing in systematic investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. Richard Brennan explained his approach to "pant sizing" (loose parameters) across multiple systems with different look-back periods (50-day to 300-day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Loose Pants Metaphor**: Refers to using few parameters (4-5 at maximum) for each system (entry, stop, trailing stop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. This allows greater responsiveness to price movements by not overly constraining the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **ATR-Based Stops**: Initial and trailing stops are based on Average True Range (ATR), which normalizes the trading system to any liquid market (e.g., Bitcoin, currency, ETF), allowing consistent trading across diverse instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Shorter-term models have tighter ATR-based stops than medium-to-long-term models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.
*   **Targeting Trends**: Different models target different facets of trends, from short-term momentum to more "wandering Trend cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

### Kelly Criterion for Position Sizing

The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula that optimizes position sizing to maximize geometric returns based on historical win percentage, loss percentage, and return-to-risk relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Assumptions**: It demands stable returns and exact knowledge of expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.
*   **Aggressiveness**: Kelly is a very aggressive formula. If there's "wandering" in win rates or return-to-risk relationships, it can lead to "deep water" due to high leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Trend Following vs. Kelly**: Richard avoids Kelly for trend following methods because they target the "chaotic region" of the tail distribution, where stability is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Trend following deals with non-stationary markets and regime changes, which defy the stable statistics needed for Kelly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.
*   **Convergent vs. Divergent Styles**: Kelly can be useful for convergent trading styles, which look for predictable, stable regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. However, trend following is a divergent strategy. If Henrik's trend-following system on equities shows good results with Kelly, it might be due to equities often having a mean-reverting character or the specific period being tested (e.g., the last 10 years of generally rising equities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

## Trend Following, Crisis Alpha, and Market Regimes

The discussion revisited the concept of "crisis alpha" from Alex Greifeld and Kathryn Kaminski's book, *Trend Following with Managed Futures: The Search for Crisis Alpha* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   **Uncorrelated Nature**: Trend following is generally [[global_macroeconomic_influences_on_trading_strategies | uncorrelated]] to any single asset class due to its extensive diversification across equities, commodities, bonds, currencies, and even cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. Over the last 22 years, the TTU Trend Following index showed a minus 0.1 correlation to the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>.

### Conditional Correlation: Adversity vs. Boom Periods

While overall uncorrelated, trend following exhibits "conditional correlation" depending on market regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   **Periods of Adversity (Negative Correlation)**: During sustained periods of adversity for equities (e.g., tech collapse 2002-2003, 2008 GFC, Trump trade wars 2018, COVID decline, Ukraine war/inflation 2022), the TTU Trend Following index was often negatively correlated to equities, rising sharply as equities declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. Four out of five major instances of equity adversity in the last 22 years showed clear negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This year (2022) saw significant negative correlation, leading to some of the biggest returns for trend following programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   **Periods of Boom (Positive Correlation)**: During boom periods in the equity market (e.g., 2003-2008 post-tech bubble, 2011 post-GFC resurgence, 2014-2015, 2020-2021 before adversity), both equities and the TTU Trend Following index increased, showing a positively correlated relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. There were four clear instances of positive correlation during boom periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

### Trend Following's Superiority over Bonds

Unlike bonds, which have traditionally provided a cushioning effect but limited "lifting power" (predictable returns without significant growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>, trend following offers both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>.
*   **Cushioning and Lifting**: Trend following comes to the rescue when equity markets are in adversity (cushioning) and offers "bonanzas" during boom periods (lifting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>. This combination of positive and negative correlation ultimately provides significant lifting power to the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. This is because trend following has more "strings to play on" due to its exposure to diverse asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

## Why Markets Trend: Behavioral Tendencies and Trader Impact

The reason for these correlated relationships during extremes lies in the nature of [[market_volatility_and_economic_shifts | market volatility and economic shifts]] and behavioral tendencies of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.
*   **Fear and Greed**: During periods of boom (fear of missing out) and bust (fear), behavioral tendencies change the distribution of market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>. This creates significant trending regimes, or anomalies/outliers, that trend-following systems are configured to capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.
*   **System Design for Outliers**: Trend following systems are specifically designed to target directional trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>:
    *   **Cutting Losses Short**: Losses are always cut short, avoiding "left tail" events, leading to many small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>.
    *   **Letting Profits Run**: Trailing exits allow for potentially unlimited upside, skewing the trade distribution with positive skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. A small percentage (5-10%) of trades drive the needle and provide "lifting power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>.
    *   **Long and Short Trading**: Trading both long and short capitalizes on opportunities regardless of direction and offers correlation benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

### Diversification's Role

Diversification is essential for trend followers, spreading across many markets (e.g., 60 markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.
*   **Frequency of Outliers**: While individual market outliers are infrequent, diversifying across many markets increases the overall frequency of outliers captured in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Smoother Equity Curve**: These outliers are not necessarily coincident across all markets (e.g., Euro outliers in 2014, sugar outliers later). Their distribution over time allows for continuous lifting power and a smoother portfolio equity curve, improving optimal compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.
*   **Compounding Growth**: Trend following's ability to capture these non-linear anomalies (outliers) improves the compound annual growth rate of diversified portfolios, unlike traditional diversification which primarily improves volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

### Leptokurtic Markets and Edge

Liquid markets exhibit a "leptokurtic" distribution (fat tails, high peak) rather than a normal distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. This "non-normal" nature reflects causal correlation in market data driven by participant behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>.
*   **Two Forms of Edge**:
    1.  **Convergent Practices**: Target the "peak" around the equilibrium of the distribution, where markets are predictable and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. Most market participants (around 90%) employ convergent strategies (e.g., fundamental value investing, technical analysis based on repeating patterns, high-frequency trading, central bank interventions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:44">[01:09:44]</a>. These forces stabilize markets towards an equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>.
    2.  **Divergent Techniques**: Focus on the left and right "tails" of the distribution, targeting extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. This is a less popular, non-predictive, reactive approach (e.g., options buying, diversified systematic trend followers), with only about 10% of participants specializing in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:47">[01:10:47]</a>.

### Wealth Flow during Uncertainty

When markets become unpredictable and stable-market models fail, convergent participants are forced to exit their positions, which can amplify trends (a "divergent impact") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Others may refuse to exit, averaging down with increased leverage, which can lead to margin calls and further forced exits, intensifying the divergent impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Shift**: The participant behavior ratio (90% convergent to 10% divergent) shifts as more participants are forced into divergent behavior, leading to a wealth flow from convergent to divergent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.
*   **Trend Following Beneficiaries**: Trend following programs, by consistently cutting losses, remain divergent and benefit from this non-linear amplification of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. This explains why they perform well during both booms and busts: trading behavior alters, models fail, and human behavioral tendencies (fear and greed) take over, creating exploitable trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

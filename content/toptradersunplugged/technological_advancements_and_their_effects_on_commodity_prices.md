Technological advancements have played a significant role in shaping commodity markets, influencing supply dynamics and, at times, contributing to deflationary trends. However, their current impact on commodity prices is a nuanced subject, with past disruptions and future potential distinct from present market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

## Historical Impact: The Shale Revolution
The development of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technology in the mid-2000s revolutionized the oil and gas industry in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. This disruptive technology unlocked vast shale oil and gas deposits that were previously inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.

Key impacts of the shale revolution:
*   **Massive Supply Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>: The US brought on over 10 million barrels per day of crude oil production and 95 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas production from shale fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. These numbers are larger than Saudi Arabia's individual output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.
*   **Deflationary Trend** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>: For about a decade or 15 years, the massive increase in supply from shale contributed to lower commodity prices, acting as a deflationary force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>.
*   **Underinvestment in Conventional Sources** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>: The focus on shale led to 15 years of significant underinvestment in other forms of exploration and development, which inevitably leads to depletion and eventually a supply response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

However, the era of easy shale growth is now considered "over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. Shale growth has turned negative year-on-year, and while the Permian basin still shows some resilience, it is expected to decline soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. There are no "next Shale fields" waiting to be discovered, as the largest ones have already been exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>. Therefore, the deflationary impact from the shale revolution is now in the rearview mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

## Future Potential: Robert Friedland's Technologies
Robert Friedland, a prominent mining executive, has been developing a suite of technologies using pulsed power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. These technologies aim to:
*   Explore for minerals more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   More efficiently drill, crush, and grind rock to liberate minerals like copper and gold from host rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

While these technologies show incredible results in the lab, they have not yet been put to work commercially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. Consequently, they are not currently driving commodity prices lower or causing a broad deflationary trend in the hard rock mining space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. Their potential impact on copper supply is a medium to long-term concern (2030 and beyond) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

## Overall Assessment of Technological Impact on Current Prices
Currently, technological advancements are not seen as the primary driver of low commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>. While the shale revolution did have a past deflationary effect, its peak growth is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. New, revolutionary technologies like those from Robert Friedland are still in early stages and not yet impacting market supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

The present "cheapness" of commodities, particularly in relation to financial assets, is attributed more to a larger [[monetary_regime_change | monetary regime cycle]] and [[commodity_super_cycles | commodity super cycles]] than to ongoing [[technological_advancements_effect_on_the_economy | technological advancements]] creating deflationary forces across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. Instead, there's a renewed appreciation for the fragility of raw material supply lines and a focus on security of supply, rather than a "weaponization" of commodities through technological superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[49:57:00]</a>.

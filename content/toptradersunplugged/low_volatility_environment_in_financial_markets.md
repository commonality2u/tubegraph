In April 2023, despite numerous events in the first quarter, the financial markets experienced remarkably low [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]], prompting discussions about its underlying causes and implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The Federal Reserve's Role in Volatility Suppression

A significant factor contributing to the current low [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] environment is the actions of the Federal Reserve (Fed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### "Selling Puts" and "Selling Calls"

The Fed's actions can be metaphorically described as "selling puts" and "selling calls" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

*   **Selling Puts**: The Fed provides liquidity to the market in various ways, such as through Quantitative Easing (QE) or by securing depositors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While securing depositors is not direct QE into equity or bond markets, it acts as a backstop for liquidity events, akin to providing a "put" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This means a tail risk has been protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. When the Fed "sells puts," it effectively lowers [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] and can create a short-term market bounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Selling Calls**: Simultaneously, the Fed is removing liquidity by increasing interest rates whenever the market rallies above a certain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This is done to counter the wealth effect and prevent excessive economic stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Essentially, the Fed is playing both sides of the market, dampening [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] on both ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Its core function is to reduce [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] and smooth the business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The Fed is specifically trying to bring the market down without triggering a liquidation event, which is a challenging task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This strategy reduces [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] on both sides while still attempting to guide the market lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Lagging Effects and Market Dynamics

The effects of the Fed's tools, particularly interest rate increases, operate with significant lags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Interest rate increases move slowly through the economy and affect various assets with a delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. For instance, BuyBacks remained at record levels in Q1 despite rate hikes throughout the previous year, only starting to fall significantly a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Similarly, recent housing starts reflect projects initiated a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This demonstrates a "wave in the distance" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

Meanwhile, short-term stimulus, such as securing depositors or the Treasury General Account's activity, provides immediate boosts to demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This creates a push-pull dynamic: short-term positive Quantitative Easing (QE)-dominant moves, exacerbated by the wealth effect, occur while a slower, larger "tidal wave" of effects from interest rate increases is still incoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

Historically, this scenario can lead to a "blow-off top" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. Market participants often position "short" in anticipation of future downturns, but structural demand and short-term stimulus can delay the expected market reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This results in a "squeeze" or blow-off top as short positions are forced to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This dynamic causes [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] to remain low initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Unpinning Volatility and Future Outlook

[[volatility_in_financial_markets | Equity volatility]] can act as a "plug" that reflexively pins the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:42">[00:53:42]</a>. Currently, [[market_volatility_and_volatility_strategies | Volatility Supply]] in equity markets is strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. The "unpinning" of this [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] often occurs in unexpected ways, potentially with intense upside moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:09">[00:54:09]</a>.

When fixed strike [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] is pinned (e.g., calls are priced on lower implied [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]]), it means dealers are long [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] and scalp gamma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. If the market continues to rise, implied [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] slides down to a point where traders consider replacing stock with calls, getting downside protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This signals that if the market goes up, [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] is good, and if it goes down, [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] is not bad, leading to a cycle where [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] supply becomes unpinned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>. Dealers may then become short [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]], forcing them to sell when the market falls and buy when it rises, further amplifying moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>.

This "unpinning" can lead to a rapid move, potentially a squeeze, where [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] itself goes higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. This dynamic involves:
1.  **Potential Energy**: How far off the floor the market is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>.
2.  **Narrative Change**: As prices change, shorts get squeezed and forced to cover, becoming more bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>.
3.  **Volatility Unpinning**: The release of the "implied [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] plug" on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:54">[00:56:54]</a>.

While this may seem ironic given the past struggles of long [[investment_strategies_for_volatility | Volatility strategies]], it could signal a period where they start to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. This environment might also see a shift from negative to positive correlation between the VIX and the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

The takeaway is that market positioning is not yet aligned with the long-term secular realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. The current low [[volatility_in_financial_markets | Volatility]] presents an opportunity, particularly in options, as a structural short in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. This suggests that "selling in May and going away" might not be applicable in 2023, with more significant shifts potentially occurring in June or July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

Investor interest in the natural resource space remains extremely pessimistic and low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:21">[03:19:21]</a>. Many believe the bull market in resources is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>. However, the world has starved the natural resource industry of capital for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:45">[03:56:45]</a>, necessitating higher prices to incentivize capital return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:42">[04:01:42]</a>. Current market problems have shifted from acute pinch points, like immediate gas supply concerns, to larger [[commodity_markets_and_economic_impacts | structural problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

The current situation is predominantly a supply-driven story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:45">[04:56:45]</a>. While demand may be volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:07">[05:01:07]</a>, strong longer-term tailwinds to demand exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:13">[05:04:13]</a>. Capital and spending have been significantly removed from the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:06">[05:11:06]</a>, with weightings in indices down 80-90% from long-term averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:10">[05:17:10]</a>. Relative valuation levels of commodities to financial assets are at their lowest in 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:24">[05:26:24]</a>. These markets are expected to resolve only through higher prices and increased spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:08">[05:29:08]</a>.

## Oil Market Dynamics
Despite efforts to stabilize oil prices, such as the US declaring intentions to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at $67-$72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:09">[06:05:09]</a>, the SPR has not seen major purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:30">[06:51:30]</a>. This is unlikely to happen before the debt ceiling is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:44">[07:23:44]</a>.

OPEC's recent production cuts, particularly the two unannounced rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:43">[08:29:43]</a>, are significant. Some interpret these cuts as proof of weaker demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:43">[08:12:43]</a>, while others suggest deteriorating Saudi-US relations or Russia's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:13">[08:20:13]</a>. Another explanation is potential depletion problems in Saudi fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:06">[09:13:06]</a>, where any production increase above 10.5 million barrels could be followed by an unexpected cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

A crucial takeaway is that OPEC is no longer terrified of US Shale producers taking market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:19">[09:54:19]</a>. US shale, particularly in the Permian, has accounted for 100% of non-OPEC oil supply growth over the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. OPEC's actions imply they no longer fear shale's ability to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:19">[10:17:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE] OPEC's Power and Spare Capacity
> OPEC's power as a cartel stems from its spare capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:07">[14:00:07]</a>. If Saudi Arabia is perceived to lack spare capacity, it risks losing influence within OPEC and on the geopolitical stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:07">[14:31:07]</a>. This sensitivity makes unexpected cuts a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:07">[15:06:07]</a>.

## Natural Gas Market Dynamics
A significant asymmetry in the natural gas market has been the 90% discount of US natural gas energy molecules compared to international oil or gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:07">[17:50:07]</a>. This is primarily due to insufficient LNG export terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:06">[18:37:06]</a>. When demand increases, prices can converge rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:07">[19:50:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] Recent Natural Gas Market Events
> *   **US Market:** The Freeport LNG facility fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:11">[21:04:11]</a> caused the US to lose 2 BCF a day for 200 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>, leading to inventory builds despite strong domestic demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:07">[21:33:07]</a>.
> *   **European Market:** A very mild winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:55:07">[21:55:07]</a>, combined with policy decisions like shutting down industrial production, increasing coal use, cutting trees for wood pellets, and stockpiling oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:07">[22:25:07]</a>, has left Europe "awash" in gas with high inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:07">[22:58:07]</a>.

While immediate acute problems have been removed, larger [[commodity_markets_and_economic_impacts | structural problems]] remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:59">[24:17:59]</a>. Europe still needs to replace 15 BCF a day of Russian gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:22:29">[25:22:29]</a>, which is not easily achievable given current infrastructure limitations for LNG imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:26">[25:52:26]</a>. The US Marcellus shale, its largest source of gas growth, has not grown for 18-20 months, indicating potential field depletion rather than pipeline issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:17">[23:30:17]</a>. The US will see significant new LNG export capacity (2 BCF/day this year, 2-3 BCF/day next year) with no huge supply response to meet it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:02:18">[24:02:18]</a>. This points to a very tight gas market over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:13">[26:39:13]</a>.

### Permian Basin Gas Phenomenon
The Permian Basin, primarily an oil field, is also a growing source of gas supply in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:06">[26:56:06]</a>. Gas in the Permian is dissolved in oil, similar to carbon dioxide in a soda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:07">[27:26:07]</a>. A long-standing worry is that depleting the basin will lower reservoir pressures, causing gas to liberate from the oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:44:00">[28:44:00]</a>. This leads to preferential gas flow (gas flowing more easily than oil) and potentially catastrophic well failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:07">[29:53:07]</a>.

Currently, the Permian is showing preferential gas growth, with gas growth rates twice that of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:28:41">[29:28:41]</a>. This could be an ironic "swan song" – a surge in perceived high supply growth that actually signals the beginning of the Permian's degradation and depletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:07">[30:07:07]</a>. Signs suggest this could be a late 2023 to early 2024 phenomenon, with well quality already degrading by 10-15% year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:07">[31:53:07]</a>.

## Nuclear Energy: A Long Game
Nuclear power is seen as a highly efficient and CO2-free solution for future energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:07">[35:19:07]</a>. It is three times as efficient as oil and gas, compared to renewables (wind and solar) which are 1/6 as efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:44:31">[35:44:31]</a>.

Current third-generation nuclear reactors are expensive, large, generate waste (though less problematic than perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:07">[36:12:07]</a>), and face perceived safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:07">[36:02:07]</a>. Actual safety records are strong, with only one material event (Chernobyl, operated as a weapons facility) in 60 years of global operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39:07">[36:39:07]</a>. Their high cost is due to stringent safety requirements, necessitating active pumping of high-pressure water to cool cores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:07">[39:12:07]</a>, requiring massive steel and cement structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:07">[39:35:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] [[technological_advancements_and_their_effects_on_commodity_prices | New Nuclear Reactor Technologies]]
> Fourth-generation or small modular reactors (SMRs) offer potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:39:07">[40:39:07]</a>.
> *   **Shrunken AP1000s (e.g., NuScale):** These are smaller (300 MW) versions of existing designs, aiming for cost reduction through factory-based mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:07">[40:52:07]</a>. However, the amount of material per unit of electricity remains similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:49:07">[41:49:07]</a>, suggesting limited cost differentiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:11:07">[41:11:07]</a>.
> *   **Molten Salt Reactors (e.g., TerraPower):** Backed by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, these reactors use molten salt instead of water to cool the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:47:07">[42:47:07]</a>. Molten salt, which melts at 300°C and boils at 700-800°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:10:07">[43:10:07]</a>, can passively cool the reactor (walk-away safe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:07">[43:27:07]</a>. This eliminates the need for high pressure, drastically reducing the required steel, cement, and overall plant size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:42:07">[43:42:07]</a>. The bill of materials can fall by 75-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:07">[44:26:07]</a>. This technology has been studied in labs since the 1950s/60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:51:07">[44:51:07]</a> but was not adopted for submarines due to the flammability of hot salt if it reacts with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:06:58">[46:06:58]</a>.

## Precious Metals: Gold's Bull Market
Gold is seen as poised for a huge rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:45:00">[47:45:00]</a>. Historically, the value of gold relative to financial assets has been a predictive measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:15">[48:22:15]</a>. Current ratios suggest gold could go well over $10,000, potentially as high as $15,000 an ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:19:07">[49:19:07]</a>. No massive [[commodity_super_cycles | commodity full cycle]] led by capital starvation has occurred without a gold component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31:07">[49:31:07]</a>.

A major driver is the significant arrival of central bank buyers, who made record quarterly purchases in Q4 2022 and continued strong buying into Q1 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:46:07">[50:46:07]</a>. This buying is widespread, driven by concerns over the weaponization of the dollar (e.g., China insulating itself after US actions against Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:07">[51:17:07]</a>. Central banks are seen as inelastic buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:52:07">[51:52:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[monetary_regime_change_and_its_impact_on_commodities | Monetary Regime Change]]
> Past [[overview_of_past_and_present_commodity_markets | commodity cycles]] have coincided with shifts in the global monetary order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:49:07">[56:49:07]</a>:
> *   1929: End of the classic gold standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:07">[56:56:07]</a>.
> *   1968: Abolition of US dollar gold backing (pre-1971 gold window closure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:04:07">[57:04:07]</a>.
> *   1999: Asian currency crisis leading to managed, low Asian currencies relative to the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:22:07">[57:22:07]</a>.
>
> The current cycle might involve a de-dollarization trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:47:07">[57:47:07]</a>, with transactions like LNG, soybeans, iron, and crude oil being settled in Renminbi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:10:07">[58:10:07]</a>. This could lead to conversion of Renminbi into gold via the Shanghai Gold Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:31:07">[58:31:07]</a>, further boosting gold prices to radically overvalued levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:07">[58:40:07]</a>.

## Industrial Metals
Inventories for industrial metals like copper are very tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>. Despite recession fears, copper demand has been strong, particularly in China (up 30% year-on-year) and India (strong double digits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. This is driven by economic growth and the shift towards renewables, which are copper-laden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. Supply is not keeping up due to significant mining issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Copper prices, at $3.60-$4.00, remain historically high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>. Substitution is difficult in key uses like electricity distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>, and new mines take 5-10 years to come online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Concentrated Supply Chains
> Certain commodities have highly centralized control or production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:50">[01:06:50]</a>:
> *   **Rare Earths:** Production and separation are heavily concentrated in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>, partly due to environmental concerns and tricky separation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>.
> *   **Uranium:** Russia controls a significant portion of uranium beneficiation (upgrading raw uranium to fuel rods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. Uranium rock extraction is dominated by Canada and Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:26">[01:09:26]</a>.
> *   **Copper:** Production is quite concentrated in countries like Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.
> *   **PGMs (Platinum Group Metals):** Platinum is concentrated in South Africa, and Palladium in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>.
> *   **Nickel:** While overall nickel is in surplus due to Indonesian investment, high-quality, battery-grade nickel, which doesn't require environmentally damaging processing, is predominantly found in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Overarching Themes and Investment Considerations
The current environment is characterized by [[geopolitical_factors_influencing_commodity_markets | geopolitical conflict]], populism, and de-globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. This drives the commodity cycle, leading to more expensive money and increased conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:09">[01:00:09]</a>. Historically, capital cycles involve a shift from abstract assets (ideas, future cash flows) to concrete and real assets (businesses, current cash flows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. During periods like the 1930s Depression and 1970s, commodity stocks performed well even during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>.

Regarding [[volatility_in_commodity_markets | volatility in commodity markets]], during the 1970s, commodity price [[volatility_in_commodity_markets | decreased]] despite being a bullish period, due to an "OPEC put" on markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. However, commodities tied to interest rates and the dollar (like gold) tended to have more [[volatility_in_commodity_markets | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. Recently, oil volatility has decreased while precious metal volatility has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

### [[investment_strategies_in_commodities | Investment Strategies in Commodities]]
For gold, investors often combine owning paper gold (ETFs like GLD) for ease with physical bullion for security against extreme tail risks like financial system collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. For energy and materials, direct physical ownership is often impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. Investing in equities of commodity producers is a common approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Equity Investment Considerations
> Commodity equities are still equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:35]</a>; they are less correlated to the broader market but not zero-correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>. In past financial panics (e.g., 1929-1940, 2008), even with strong fundamentals, stocks can decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:50]</a>. To mitigate this risk, focus on asset quality and balance sheet quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>, choosing businesses with good underlying fundamentals that will not be wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.

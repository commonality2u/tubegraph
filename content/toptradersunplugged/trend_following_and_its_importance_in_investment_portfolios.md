## Introduction
[[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]] is a systematic investment strategy that reacts to existing market movements rather than anticipating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. It aims to deploy exposure in a market once a direction is confirmed, allowing it to benefit from sustained price moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The strategy provides convexity, as it tends to sell into negative trends to profit from downward movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Historical Context and Evolution
The [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] space experienced significant growth around 2008, following strong performance by managers who had taken short positions in equities and long positions in bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. However, the period between 2010 and 2020 was generally challenging for [[Trend following in investment strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>. This underperformance was not due to crowding, reduced diversification, or ineffective signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>, but primarily because markets were less "trendy" during this decade, often exhibiting frequent breaks and smaller sustained movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:42">[00:58:42]</a>.

A key factor during this challenging period was the presence of the "Fed put" â€“ a perceived fundamental certainty that central banks would intervene to support markets if they declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This led to expectations that price deviations would likely revert, hindering prolonged trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## Debunking Misconceptions: Blame and Capacity
[[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]] strategies, particularly those employed by Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs), are often blamed for magnifying negative market price action, especially in stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. However, this blame is largely unfounded for several reasons:
*   **Price Takers**: [[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]] is inherently reactive; it does not anticipate or create downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Wider Mechanisms**: Other market mechanisms, such as risk parity funds adjusting allocations based on volatility or discretionary investors using stop-loss rules, also contribute to selling pressure during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Limited Market Impact**: Analysis suggests that the equity exposure and potential selling delta of systematic strategies like [[Trend following in investment strategies | trend following]] represent "a very small portion of what the overall Market really is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Market Support**: In a down market with significant price reduction and volatility spikes, [[Trend following as a trading strategy | trend followers]] often reduce their gross exposure, effectively "buying back" and acting as a "support to the market" rather than intensifying the move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:23">[01:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Crowding Concerns**: The idea of "crowding" causing underperformance in [[Trend following Investment Strategy | trend following]] was not supported by statistical analysis based on performance-flow regressions or by simulating the entire industry's AUM against open interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. The impact of crowding is not necessarily negative and can even be a prerequisite for a systematic premium to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

While very illiquid markets might theoretically face capacity issues if allocated equally, active managers typically adapt their allocations based on market depth and available liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. As of October 2022, the [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] industry's assets under management (AUM) were estimated around $350-400 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, which is about 10% of the total hedge fund industry, and not considered to be approaching problematic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

## Diversification and Alternative Markets
When considering the market universe for [[Trend following investment strategies | trend following]], there's a debate between using a wide range of markets (300-400) versus a classical set (around 60 markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. Key principles influencing this decision include:
*   **Diversification**: Adding more markets can enhance portfolio diversification, improving the Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Less liquid, "exotic" or "alternative" markets, such as certain commodities or cryptocurrencies, present challenges from a liquidity standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.
*   **Trendiness**: The probability of observing prolonged trends is important. While alternative markets *might* exhibit slower news transmission and thus stronger trends, practical evidence does not consistently show better performance or statistically significant trendiness compared to classical markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. The primary benefit of including them often remains diversification due to their low correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>.

## Modern Relevance and Future Outlook
The year 2022 marked a significant shift in market dynamics, making [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The substantial performance of [[Trend following Investment Strategies | trend following]] in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>, contrasted with the challenging performance of traditional multi-asset portfolios (e.g., 60/40 portfolios) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>, highlights its value.

This shift is attributed to a move from "fundamental certainty" (prevalent during the "Fed put" era) to "fundamental uncertainty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. When there's broad disagreement on economic outlooks (e.g., inflation risks, soft/hard landing), price moves are more likely to contain genuine information and become sustained, creating prolonged trends that [[Trend following trading strategies | trend following]] is designed to harvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>. The shift from the "transitory" inflation debate in 2021 to a clear consensus on inflation in early 2022 provided a "cataclysmic confirmation of those Trends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

Many experts now argue that having [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] in a portfolio is "essential" rather than optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:42">[01:09:42]</a>. Given the current regime shift, characterized by macro uncertainty and micro volatility, portfolios require more active and dynamic allocation schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. The question is not whether it's "too late" to allocate to [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]], but rather how to strategically incorporate this essential defensive component for both short-term risk management and long-term capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>. The long-standing benchmark for balanced portfolios, like the 60/40, may need to shift to include such dynamic strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:13">[01:10:13]</a>.

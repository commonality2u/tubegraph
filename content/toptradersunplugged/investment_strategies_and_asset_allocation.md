## Introduction to Investment Strategy and Market Outlook
Top Traders Unplugged focuses on markets and [[Global macroeconomic strategies and asset allocation | global macroeconomic strategies and asset allocation]], aiming to understand what a new global macro-driven world might look like by exploring perspectives on game-changing issues [01:43:53]. The show emphasizes that discussions about investment performance pertain to the past, and past performance does not guarantee future results [01:15:37]. A significant risk of financial loss is associated with all [[Investment Strategies and Risks | investment strategies]], and investors should understand specific risks from an investment manager before making decisions [01:23:45].

## Karl Sakasoff's Background and Approach
Karl Sakasoff, Chairman and Founder of 13D Research & Strategy (founded 1983), has advised major capital pools globally for over 40 years, including money managers, pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family offices, hedge funds, and business leaders [02:29:43]. His publications, "What I Learned This Week" and "What Are the Markets Telling Us," are influential [02:51:71]. Sakasoff is known for major market calls, such as the bull market in bonds in the 1980s, the technology boom and bust in the 1990s, and more recently, the reversal in inflation and bonds since 2020 [03:02:44].

Sakasoff's investment philosophy is centered on using his brain and finding markets infinitely interesting and dynamic [03:42:07]. He is happiest when he is "alone and when everybody disagrees" [04:15:37]. Examples of his contrarian calls include:
*   Calling the end of inflation in 1982, when long-term treasuries yielded 14-15% and were considered "certificates of confiscation" by many [04:21:49].
*   Identifying Hong Kong in 1991-92 as the cheapest market globally with strong earnings, a 4-5% yield, and 4-5 times earnings, despite a "China discount" where he believed there should be a "China premium" [04:40:91].

## Structural Regime Shift in Markets
Sakasoff views the market as undergoing a structural regime shift, moving away from a 40-year bull market in bonds that began after a bottom in 1942 and a top in yields in 1981 [06:05:85]. He asserts that the bull market in bonds is over, and bonds are now "to be sold" [07:06:00]. This implies a massive shift of capital from fixed income globally [07:18:78].

He points to several factors driving this shift:
*   **Wealth Distribution:** Seen as inflationary, beginning in China in 2009, shifting to Brazil in 2012, and later with Brexit [08:36:11].
*   **Reshoring/Friend-shoring:** Also inflationary as national security influences economic policy decisions [09:02:83].
*   **Inflationary Expectations:** A general rise in expectations [09:15:46].
*   **Extreme Weather Events:** Impacting resources like water and soil [09:18:03].
*   **Underinvestment in Commodities:** Particularly in sectors like copper, essential for energy transition [09:34:39].
*   **Demographics:** While a global baby bust was deflationary (as seen in Japan from 1997), the current largest retirement of the adult working population in the developed world is very inflationary [10:06:00]. This human capital shortage in trades like carpentry and electrical work cannot be replaced by technology, despite advances in robotics and AI [10:27:06]. The doubling of the world's job force between 2000 and 2020 (due to China's WTO entry, Soviet Union's fall, and women joining the workforce) is now reversing, creating a "big secular headwind that the Fed can't control" [10:40:53].

## Key Investment Themes and Asset Allocation

### Bonds
Sakasoff believes the 40-year bull market in bonds, which saw yields peak in 1981, is over [06:26:00]. He advises that bonds are to be sold, and while rallies might occur, the long-term secular bear market in bonds has "massive" implications for the huge amount of capital tied up in fixed income globally [07:06:00]. He anticipates that if a recession occurs, the Fed will "stimulate and throw money at the system," weakening the dollar and stimulating the economy, a pattern seen "many, many times" [07:30:00]. This leads to the conclusion that the opposite of what worked for the last 40 years (through 2019) will now be true [07:51:00].

### Gold and Gold Miners
Gold is a favored asset for Sakasoff, who sees it as a supply-demand story where two trillion dollars are added to the dollar universe while only 1% is added to the gold universe annually [00:00:22]. He believes gold is poised for a "major breakout" [00:00:22].
*   **Historical Performance:** Over the last 25 years, gold is up 677%, while the S&P is up 288% [00:36:06].
*   **Manipulation & Central Bank Behavior:** Sakasoff believes gold has been manipulated, citing bank traders sentenced for manipulation and former Fed Chair Paul Volcker's regret over letting gold prices rise in 1979 [00:36:27]. Central banks historically view rising gold prices as a sign of disrespect for their currency [00:36:47].
*   **De-dollarization Catalyst:** The confiscation (freezing) of Russian foreign exchange reserves served as a "wake-up call" for many countries holding treasuries, driving a "liquidation of treasuries" and a shift towards gold [00:37:00]. Singapore's monetary authority's large gold purchase and India's response to it are examples of this de-dollarization trend [00:37:41].
*   **Gold Miners:** Sakasoff considers gold mining stocks the "cheapest asset on the planet," followed by gold itself [00:45:14]. He notes a huge discrepancy: gold is up 11% annually since 2011, while miners are down 40% [00:46:11]. Despite increased costs in recent years (now declining 14-25%), the industry is "incredibly cheap" with a global AUM percentage probably "under 1%" compared to 8% at its 1980 peak [00:46:19]. He anticipates a "severe shortage of physical gold" when gold breaks out, making miners the primary way to gain exposure, as they typically outperform bullion in major moves [00:45:50].

### Commodities (Oil, Copper, Uranium)
Sakasoff maintains a bullish long-term view on commodities, especially oil, copper, and uranium, due to underinvestment and rising demand [00:09:34].
*   **Oil:** He turned "very bullish on oil and oil stocks" in early 2021 [00:06:59]. He believes there is insufficient investment in oil exploration, and calls of "peak demand" are premature, as demand continues to "roar ahead" [00:21:36]. He notes that OECD demand for oil peaked in 2004, with emerging market demand driving growth since [00:25:03]. The Permian Basin, a significant source of shale oil, is not expected to produce at its current rates for much longer, leading to potential "significant downside surprises" in supply [00:24:30]. OPEC+ has increased power and is serious about maintaining prices [00:23:56]. This overall picture is "very bullish" and inflationary for oil over the next three to five years [00:21:50].
*   **Copper:** For the energy transition, "massive money" needs to be spent on copper [00:09:39]. However, exploration budgets are one-third below their 2012 highs in nominal terms [00:27:28]. With increased demand of 13 million metric tons per year by 2030, the "logical assumption is that the copper price is going to go up dramatically" [00:37:37].
*   **Uranium:** After decades of study, Sakasoff concluded uranium was the best source of electricity, despite past accidents [00:28:17]. He highlights a "massive shift" towards nuclear energy, with 22 countries at COP28 declaring intent to triple nuclear capacity [00:28:40]. Due to underinvestment, there's a shortage of about 40 million pounds a year, requiring "significantly higher" prices to stimulate exploration [00:29:24].

### Geographic Markets
*   **China:** While currently experiencing deflation and a confidence crisis, Sakasoff believes China has "more policy room than virtually any country in the world" [00:12:15]. He points to recent government actions like tying SOE management compensation to stock market performance as "historic" moves to boost confidence [00:12:25]. He views China's current deflation as cyclical and believes the country will become an inflationary force again [00:11:35]. He dismisses concerns about China's debt by considering the asset side of the balance sheet, where government-owned SOEs have a net asset value of 70% of China's GDP, making the country "net debt free to the total of 30%" when combined with federal debt [00:13:09]. Despite a peak in China's working population in 2012, GDP has doubled since then [00:14:15]. Sakasoff's "China Deep Value Index" (focused on deep value and high dividends) is up 42% since November 2021, outperforming the S&P by a wide margin even in a bear market for China [00:14:51].
*   **India:** Sakasoff is "very bullish on India," comparing its current vitality to China in 1992 [00:52:08]. He commends Prime Minister Modi's achievements in connecting people to bank accounts, building infrastructure, and bringing the underground economy into the formal economy [00:52:51].
*   **Japan:** Japan is "doing well," and the government actively seeks higher stock market prices and participation [00:34:35].
*   **Europe (Germany):** Germany has "shot itself in the foot" by losing competitiveness due to expensive imported LNG (compared to cheap Russian natural gas) [00:30:28]. Europe faces a "bind" regarding Chinese electric vehicles, which are significantly cheaper, balancing industry ties in China with potential trade barriers [00:31:20].

### Other Investment Considerations
*   **Traditional 60/40 Portfolio:** For 40 years, the 60/40 equity/bond portfolio worked well due to negative correlation [00:33:37]. However, Sakasoff would "not want to own bonds" in a new long-term portfolio [00:34:08].
*   **De-dollarization:** The U.S. dollar's role as a reserve currency is diminishing in importance [00:39:41]. Countries are increasingly trading in their own currencies (e.g., China paying Saudi Arabia for oil in RMB) [00:40:47]. The need for large foreign exchange reserves has been "drastically reduced" for many countries, which were previously dependent on the US for swap lines [00:40:02]. Foreign central banks stopped financing the U.S. government in 2014 [00:40:42].
*   **Fiscal Dominance:** Sakasoff believes the U.S. now has "fiscal dominance," with Janet Yellen controlling financial matters, and the U.S. Congress not understanding the finite limits of increasing debt [00:44:40]. This implies higher yields in the U.S. over time and a more challenging financing situation [00:44:07].
*   **Bitcoin/Crypto:** Sakasoff sees Bitcoin as complementary to gold, not an "either or" choice [00:49:01]. He notes that some crypto VCs are now buying gold [00:37:31].
*   **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI's adoption rate is unprecedented (e.g., 85% of Indians using AI) [00:50:06]. While its impact will be "huge," the timing (now vs. 10 years) is uncertain [00:50:17]. He draws parallels to the dot-com bubble of 2000, where the internet ultimately changed the world, but valuations were too high at the time [00:50:51].

## Idea Generation and Learning
Sakasoff's idea generation comes from anything that "grabs his attention," often from anomalies or "outlier" events that signal significant change [00:58:16]. He highlights the 500-year flood in Eastern Europe in 2002 as a trigger for focusing on climate change [00:54:27]. He observes that when something that "should be happening isn't" or vice versa, it often reveals the truth [00:56:20].

For those starting in global macro investing, Sakasoff strongly recommends:
*   **Studying History:** Particularly financial history, as it offers immense insight [00:59:52].
*   **Recommended Reads:**
    *   "The Price of Time" by Edward Chancellor: About the dangers of free money and low interest rates [01:00:03].
    *   "Lords of Finance" [01:00:19].
    *   "The Bubble That Broke the World" by Garet Garrett: Discusses the 1920s and 1930s, noting how debt problems were met with more debt, and how the 1929 crash was exacerbated by Wall Street selling European bonds to American savers, leading to defaults and losses [01:00:25]. He draws parallels to the current environment where risk was not priced into much of the debt, and rolling it over at higher interest rates in a different credit environment will reveal problems [01:01:41].

EMC Capital Advisors, a firm founded in 1988 by Elizabeth Cheval, an initial participant in the "Turtle Program," emphasizes a systematic, quantitative approach to trading with a strong focus on [[Diversification and risk management in trading systems | risk management]] and capturing directional price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The firm's managing director, Brian Proctor, highlights that the "real key" in trading is to hold onto winning positions and cut losses quickly, aiming for winners that are two to two-and-a-half times larger than losing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Core Investment Philosophy

EMC Capital's investment philosophy is grounded in the belief that all relevant market information is reflected in price, and quantitative analysis is the most effective method to identify predictable price trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Historical data demonstrates that markets consistently trend, offering identifiable and repeatable profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Their objective is to develop and implement quantitative, systematic strategies that deliver long-term positive returns with low correlation to other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Returns are their primary focus, as the natural divergence of CTA strategies from other asset classes inherently provides [[Diversification and portfolio management | portfolio diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategy and Risk Management

The firm's strategy has evolved considerably since its early days, moving from traditional breakout systems to incorporating different types of [[Diversification in investment strategies | trend following]] and momentum-based systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This evolution included overhauling trading systems, leverage usage, and [[Diversification and risk management in trading systems | risk management]] protocols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The change was partly driven by a shift in investor appetite from higher returns and volatility, typical when risk-free rates were high, to a demand for smoother return streams and lower drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Key Aspects of Risk Management:

Risk management is considered the most crucial aspect of a CTA's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. EMC Capital manages risk at every level of its investment program:

1.  **System-Level Risk:**
    *   Each trading system has a maximum loss limit per trade in every market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>. Different systems have varying max loss thresholds, with some designed to accept more volatility and larger drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>.
    *   Systems rarely hit their hard stop, with liquidation criteria often kicking in beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
2.  **Volatility-Based Sizing and Filters:**
    *   The firm uses a short look-back window (approximately two weeks) to determine market volatility, making their approach very reactive to recent changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
    *   As volatility increases, smaller position sizes are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. In more consolidated periods, a larger number of contracts may be initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.
    *   Each system incorporates a volatility filter that may prevent trading if volatility in a particular market is too high (e.g., in the top 15% of historical volatility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. This is based on research showing that trading in highly volatile environments leads to more losing trades and hard stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. However, filters vary across systems to ensure that at least one or two systems can still initiate trades even during volatile times, preventing missed trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
3.  **Market/Sector-Level Risk:**
    *   Every market has a limited amount of risk it can take at initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>.
    *   The firm limits the amount of risk that can be allocated to any one market or sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>. For example, the energy sector has a maximum risk allocation of 10% to 11% in their Trend following program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
4.  **Portfolio-Level Risk (Scaling Back Positions):**
    *   A significant departure from traditional approaches is an algorithm that considers open trade equity and unliquidated profits at the portfolio level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   This algorithm, introduced in the late 2000s, has profit and time elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. When certain profit thresholds are reached or trends mature, it begins to scale back positions, locking in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
    *   This mechanism aims to align risk with current volatility and cushion against drawdowns when trends reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
    *   While sacrificing some upside potential in explosive periods, it leads to outperformance during reversal periods by preserving gains, a concept related to marginal utility for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. Positions can be cut by 60-75% in the most aggressive scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

## [[Building a diversified investment portfolio | Building a Diversified Investment Portfolio]]

EMC Capital offers different programs to cater to various investor risk appetites, from higher-risk trend following to programs with smoother return streams that incorporate long-only elements in equities, bonds, and commodities (e.g., a long gold holding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

### Blending of Systems

The firm's programs utilize a blend of systems based on two core concepts:
1.  **Trend Following Systems:** These confirm current price trends across long, medium, and short time frames (e.g., 180, 40, and 15 days) to identify established trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Different liquidation criteria differentiate holding periods, with some quicker to liquidate and re-initiate (15-25 days average) and others holding positions longer (35-45 days average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.
2.  **Momentum Systems:** These are very different in initiation, focusing on a time-weighted analysis of recent daily data (last two-three weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>. They look at two things:
    *   Closing prices to identify emerging trends based on the number of positive closes over various time slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.
    *   The speed and magnitude of daily price action, kicking in when volatility increases and prices accelerate rapidly in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>.

This blending of systems diversifies entry and exit points for trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. Each system has an equal [[Diversification and risk management in trading systems | risk weighting]], ensuring no bias towards longer-term systems, as the best-performing system can be random from period to period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

### Market Selection and Weighting

The firm trades around 70-something markets and plans to add more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:17">[00:46:17]</a>. When adding markets, they consider:
*   **Liquidity:** Markets must be liquid enough for the Assets Under Management (AUM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. Less liquid markets (e.g., lumber, orange juice, oats) receive lower risk weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. These smaller markets can still generate significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>.
*   **[[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | Correlation]] to Existing Sectors:** New markets (like iron ore) are evaluated for their correlation within their sector (e.g., base metals) to adjust existing market weightings and maintain [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | portfolio diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:48:01">[00:48:01]</a>.
*   **Historical Return Stream:** They analyze how their trading systems would perform in a given market, favoring markets with more linear trends and fewer "hiccups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>. Markets with better return expectations can receive higher weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>.
*   **Long Bias:** Historically, long trades have been more profitable, leading the firm to apply a slight bias, making long positions a little larger than short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

## Importance of Research and Adaptability

EMC Capital regularly re-optimizes its systems' parameter sets based on new data, combining long-term historical performance with shorter look-back windows (e.g., 5- or 7-year Sortino numbers) to improve [[portfolio_diversification_and_risk_management | risk-adjusted returns]] and adapt to evolving markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. This re-optimization process is staggered throughout the year to avoid wholesale changes at one time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>.

The firm also focuses on adapting its "technical logic," which refers to the performance metrics used to optimize systems (e.g., blending return elements with risk-adjusted elements like Sortino, or concepts of efficiency in trend capture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>. This discretionary research into core logic determines the target return profile for each system and how they blend together in the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>.

Forward walk, or out-of-sample testing, is crucial for ensuring the reliability and reproducibility of their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:31">[00:43:31]</a>. Comparing real-time trading results to hypothetical out-of-sample performance helps maintain confidence in their approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions about Trend Following

Brian Proctor disagrees with common sentiments that "all CTAs are doing the same thing" or that "trend following is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. He emphasizes the significant work, testing, and diverse ideas involved in developing and maintaining effective trend following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>, highlighting that the complexity makes it "certainly not simple or easy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. The firm's long-term goal is to generate positive returns that add [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | diversification]] and benefits to an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Outlook

Markets today are more liquid than in the past, but the flow of information is much quicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Markets tend to react more rapidly to news, which can lead to quick reversals and cascade liquidations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. This dynamic reinforces the firm's preference for a blend of systems, including shorter-term ones, to be nimble in liquidating positions during steep trend reversals and avoid prolonged pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

Looking ahead to 2023, there is significant uncertainty (e.g., resurgence of inflation, global debt issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. This environment underscores the value of systematic strategies that can trade unique markets, commodities, interest rates, and take short positions in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The quantitative approach helps in navigating this uncertainty and managing outlier risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Increased volatility across various markets and sectors suggests active trends, affirming the firm's optimistic yet cautious outlook for systematic commodity trading strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="1:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

The current period is described as a "trajectory moment" in history, marked by a significant "regime change" in the global market environment compared to the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:07">[03:14:07]</a>. This shift is characterized by [[Populism and Globalization Trends | populism]] and its wide-ranging economic implications.

## The Populist Period: Origins and Dynamics

The current populist wave in the US is argued to have begun around 2009 with the emergence of movements like the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:07">[43:13:07]</a>. While initially not politically dominant, these movements reflected a growing discontent among certain segments of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:07">[43:30:07]</a>.

### Underlying Causes
*   **Demographic Shifts**: The shift is significantly tied to demographics, particularly the dynamic between old and young generations, which also reflects a struggle between capital and labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55:07">[43:55:07]</a>. Younger generations, who have experienced being disadvantaged due to inequality, are now growing into political dominance, leading to a shift in political winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:48:07">[44:48:07]</a>.
*   **Economic Inequality**: A core driver is the feeling among people that "the system does not work for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:20:07">[45:20:07]</a>. This discontent has created frustration across various groups, including those in rusted-out cities in Middle America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:01:07">[46:01:07]</a>, and poor white and black men who have seen a "massive decline" in their prospects over two generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:39:07">[46:39:07]</a>.
*   **Political Manifestations**: The desire for change manifested early on with figures like Obama, whose appeal was rooted in populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:09:07">[45:09:07]</a>. The anger and populism eventually led to the rise of Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:46:07">[46:46:07]</a>.

### Key Catalysts
*   **Donald Trump's Influence**: Trump is seen as a "vehicle for the sentiment" of populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:07">[42:23:07]</a>. He successfully brought conservative politics to a more populist stance, effectively making populism a dominant force across the political spectrum, from figures like AOC and Bernie Sanders to himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:53:07">[46:53:07]</a>.
*   **COVID-19**: The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a major catalyst, likened to the assassination of Kennedy in a previous populist era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:39:07">[47:39:07]</a>. It "unleashed a massive amount of fiscal spending" that went beyond addressing the pandemic, instituting populist policies that will have effects stretching for 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:45:07">[47:45:07]</a>.

## Economic Implications

### Election Year Dynamics
Historical data reveals a distinctive pattern for equity markets during populist election years in the US.
*   **Overall Election Year Returns**: Since the 1920s, election years have averaged an 11% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:19:07">[34:19:07]</a>.
*   **Populist Election Year Outliers**: Excluding five specific election years (1964, 1968, 1972, 1976, 1980) from the 1920s to the present, the average return drops to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:07">[34:51:07]</a>. The excluded five years, all within a period of market stagnation (1968-1982) where the market went nowhere for 14 years and lost 70% in real terms, were "up double digits" and averaged 21.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:07">[35:08:07]</a>.
*   **Current Alignment**: Recent elections, defined as populist elections, have followed this pattern, with the 2020 election seeing a 21% gain and the current year (2024) already up 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:58:07">[36:58:07]</a>.
*   **Reasoning**: This strong performance in populist election years is attributed to politicians "feeding money to people" through Federal Reserve policy and "pumping the market to get elected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:23:07">[36:23:07]</a>. However, this eventually incurs a "bill" that gets paid in the years following the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:07">[36:38:07]</a>.

### Inflation and Interest Rates
[[Inflation and Economic Policies | Inflation]] and interest rates are "intrinsically tied" and "critical" drivers of market outcomes, directly affected by [[political_influence_on_economic_policies | populism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:51:07">[49:51:07]</a>. While populist periods before the 1960s and 1970s (e.g., the Great Depression) were deflationary, the current period is more likely to be inflationary due to the influence and mandate of the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:16:07">[51:16:07]</a>. The Fed's mandate to avoid a Great Depression and manage volatility often involves "nominal illusion" and "shaving of coins" to manage the loss of real wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:47:07">[51:47:07]</a>.

### Volatility in Fixed Income and Currencies
The Federal Reserve faces an "incredibly tricky situation" due to its dual mandate and limited tools, operating in an environment of structural inflation created by past borrowing from the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:07">[53:01:07]</a>. The "fed put," a perceived safety net for markets, is no longer as "truly valid or clear," which increases volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:07">[54:21:07]</a>.

Historically, during populist periods, the greatest volatility is not seen in equity markets or most commodity markets, but rather in:
*   FX (foreign exchange) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07:07">[55:07:07]</a>
*   Yield bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07:07">[55:07:07]</a>
*   Precious metals (like gold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07:07">[55:07:07]</a>

This is exacerbated by a time of deglobalization, global conflict, and the Fed's reduced control over economic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:15:07">[55:15:07]</a>. The election of Donald Trump is seen as an "acceleration point" for this increased volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:48:07">[55:48:07]</a>.

### Impact on Governance and Future Cycles
The desire to "gut government" during this populist period is considered "popular," but it might not "end well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. While populist leaders like Donald Trump may implement populist policies (e.g., tariffs, [[Role of populism and protectionism in international politics | protectionism]], immigration policy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:43">[01:06:43]</a>, other actions like tax cuts, which largely benefit corporations and wealthy individuals, can "exacerbate populism and make things worse" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>.

There is a concern that if parts of the government are "gutted" without being rebuilt properly, it could extend the populist cycle and lead to more volatile periods of poor market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. The fundamental "political winds and demographic realities" are not going away, and if people's desires are not met, the discontent will persist and worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08:07">[01:10:08:07]</a>.

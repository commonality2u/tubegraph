[[Shortterm trading strategies | High-frequency trading]] (HFT) is a sector within financial markets that is almost entirely [[Automated Trading Systems | systematized]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. It operates at speeds beyond human capability, making human intervention largely irrelevant in its core function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

## Characteristics

HFT systems are designed for rapid response and order updates, prioritizing latency and speed over highly sophisticated calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. The primary job of these systems is to turn around as fast as possible and update orders as new information arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. With only a few exceptions, like instances of manual spoofing, there is no human intervention in the clicking of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

## Profitability and Market Dynamics

Currently, [[Shortterm trading strategies | high-frequency trading]] firms are generally perceived to be highly profitable, with other market participants effectively paying a "tax" by executing trades in these markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

The market conditions for HFT are subject to change. Examples include:
*   Concerns raised about the "high life" problem by Hillary Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.
*   The establishment of exchanges like IEX, which were specifically set up to frustrate [[Shortterm trading strategies | high-frequency trading]] activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Despite potential changes and challenges, it is expected that the [[Automated Trading Systems | high-frequency trading]] business will continue to exist and remain profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Firms in this space will likely adapt to new market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. However, this does not guarantee that every individual firm or specific strategy will remain profitable indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

Contrastingly, strategies like [[Trendfollowing Strategies | trend-following]] in [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | systematic trading and trend following strategies]] can become self-reinforcing as more people adopt them, potentially improving returns when markets move in a sustained direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. However, this can lead to execution challenges and liquidity problems if too many participants are using similar models and rush for exits simultaneously during corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

Historically, commodities move in large, long cycles, which some refer to as "super cycles," but which are simply pronounced and prolonged cycles [05:36]. These cycles are driven by capital spending patterns within the energy and extractive metals industries [06:10].

## The Commodity Cycle Explained
During periods of commodity deficit, prices can rise significantly, leading to "super normal profits" for companies, sometimes exceeding 30% yearly cash flow returns [06:18]. This attracts capital and creates a virtuous cycle of higher stock performance [06:40]. However, due to delays in bringing new production online (discovery, proving reserves, production), too much capital can flow in, leading to oversupply and price collapse [06:51]. This results in plummeting investor returns and stock prices, often falling by 80% [07:25]. Money then pours out, and the industry is viewed negatively [07:47].

Key metrics used to track these cycles include:
*   Capital spending cycles [08:16]
*   Energy and metals weighting in various indices [08:18]
*   The broad ratio of commodity prices to stock prices (data going back 130 years) [08:25]

These metrics indicate that a significant bear market, characterized by collapsed capital spending and commodity prices between 2010 and 2020, is now reversing [08:36]. The current environment is seen as the early stages of a prolonged and large bull cycle, driven by major supply disruptions in areas that have been starved of capital [08:44]. This includes crude oil, natural gas, and uranium, where depletion is taking hold [08:56].

The current bull market is taking longer to gain momentum, similar to the early 1960s, where commodity markets bottomed and began to rally, but truly took off around 1970-1971 [09:50]. Uranium has been a standout performer in this cycle, unexpectedly leading the way [10:26]. Strong performance is anticipated in oil, natural gas, uranium, gold, and copper [10:50].

Historically, major commodity up-cycles occurred from around 2000 (linked to China's growth), with a correction before the GFC, followed by another move up after stimulus, ending around 2012 [11:31]. A large rally occurred leading into the Ukrainian situation, with a subsequent correction that is likely not a reversal of the broader trend [12:12].

## Investment Strategies

### Gold Market
The gold market is considered fundamentally different from base metals due to its role as a store of wealth and currency [13:35]. Investors are currently "gold bulls" but not "gold bugs," viewing gold as an asset that goes through periods of favor and disfavor [14:10].

*   **Valuation**: Gold is considered historically cheap relative to financial assets and based on the amount of money printed [14:50]. A fair valuation could be closer to $10,000 to $20,000 per ounce, given monetary expansion over the last 15 years [19:10].
*   **Relationship with Oil**: The gold-to-oil ratio is a key indicator. During periods of low energy prices (e.g., $20 oil during COVID-19), the ratio signaled a need to be heavily weighted towards energy and out of gold [15:31]. The reverse occurred when energy prices spiked (e.g., Russia-Ukraine war), signaling a return to precious metals [15:58].
*   **Impact of Real Rates**: Typically, rising real rates lead to poor gold performance as Western investors sell [16:22]. This was observed in 2022 and 2023, with widespread liquidation of gold ETFs and Futures contracts [16:35].
*   **Central Bank Buying**: Despite Western selling, central banks have been accumulating gold, absorbing more than what was sold, which has driven gold prices to all-time highs of $2,500 an ounce [17:09].
*   **Gold Stocks**: Gold stocks have not kept pace with the gold price [18:25]. The Western investor sells both gold bars and shares, while central banks only buy physical gold, leaving gold equities "on no bid" [18:45]. This divergence has created a significant opportunity, as gold stocks are as cheap as they've ever been relative to the spot price, comparable to 1999 and 2015 lows [20:49].
*   **Convexity and [[Volatility in Commodity Markets | Volatility]]**: Gold is seen as having higher convexity and [[Volatility in Commodity Markets | volatility]] compared to industrial commodities or energy, especially in periods of geopolitical strife or loss of confidence in fiat currencies [22:41]. This suggests a "long calls" strategy on gold might be more appropriate than for other commodities [23:37].

### Investing in Producers vs. Underlying Commodities
For large cycle moves, investing in producers (equities) is often preferred over direct commodity futures.
*   **Contango**: Holding long futures positions in a contango market (where future prices are higher than spot) results in a "roll yield" cost [26:28].
*   **Earnings Leverage**: Producers offer leverage to commodity price movements through their earnings, and can also benefit from a re-rating on valuation if bought cheaply [27:12].
*   **Volatility**: While commodity price moves are anticipated to be volatile and chaotic, with pullbacks of 35% not unheard of, being "long and strong hands" is recommended [27:44].

### Timing and Market Dynamics
As "True Value investors," the focus is on fundamental research and long-term trends rather than short-term timing [29:50]. This often means being early to trades [30:21]. The market for commodity stocks has shifted from being a forward-looking "discount mechanism" to needing "real data" in front of it before reacting [32:27]. This short-term focus, potentially due to capital flowing into areas like tech and AI, creates a time arbitrage opportunity for long-term investors [33:04].

For example:
*   The 2022 energy price surge was a result of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, a real-time event, even though the underlying market tightening was visible in 2021 [33:40].
*   In uranium, future price increases are expected to be driven by utility buyers facing actual sourcing difficulties, rather than just projected deficits [35:09].

### Monetary System Shifts as Catalysts
Historically, major commodity bull markets and outperformance in resource stocks have coincided with fundamental shifts in global monetary systems or regimes [36:08].
*   **1929**: The end of the classical gold standard, triggered by Benjamin Strong's quantitative easing policies and subsequent liquidity tightening, led to a decade of strong outperformance for natural resource equities [37:25].
*   **1968**: President Johnson effectively took the dollar off gold (legislatively removing gold backing), which coincided with the bottoming of the commodities-to-equity ratio and the beginning of an incredible bull run for commodity stocks in the 1970s [39:00].
*   **1999**: A reordering of Southeast Asian and Chinese Central Bank policies, where currencies were pegged below market rates to spur exports, led to massive flows of treasuries to the East and coincided with a commodity boom [40:10].

Currently, similar signals suggest another reordering of monetary systems is underway [40:51]. This includes China settling commodity trades outside the dollar, central banks accumulating gold, and concerns about the "weaponization" of the dollar [41:46]. These "massive [[Volatility in Commodity Markets | volatility]] events" and "imbalances in valuations" point to a necessary reordering [42:22].

This dynamic relates to Benjamin Graham's "weighing machine" (long-term fundamentals) versus "voting machine" (short-term market sentiment) [42:55]. Dislocations and [[Volatility in Commodity Markets | volatility]] act as catalysts that force the market to recognize underlying value, often when it's "incontrovertible" [43:17].

The "carry trade," as discussed in "The Rise of Carry," where the S&P 500 has become a giant carry trade, sees commodity markets often act as the "funding mechanism" (the short side) that helps propel the long side of this carry trade [53:01]. An unwind of this carry trade could precipitate a rethinking of global monetary systems and serve as a catalyst for a bottom in real assets relative to financial assets [53:40].

## Market Positioning and Contrarian Opportunities
Investor exposure to commodities remains extremely low [48:40].
*   **Energy**: The energy weighting in the S&P 500 is 3.4% as of September 2024, far below the long-term average of 10-12% and typical bull market peaks of 25-30% [49:12]. This is near historical lows (1.8% in 2020) and indicates that investors have significantly reduced their exposure [49:05]. Consistent monetary outflows from energy stock ETFs further confirm this [49:54].
*   **Uranium**: While uranium saw a bull market in 2022-2023, attracting "hot money," this money is now flowing out, indicating a contrarian opportunity as short-term traders liquidate positions [50:51].

## Specific Commodity Outlooks

### Copper
The conventional wisdom on copper is long-term bullish but short-term cautious [55:53].
*   **Long-Term Bullish (Conventional View)**: Mine supply is expected to be insufficient due to long lead times (10-20 years for discoveries, reserves, and new mines) and existing mine declines [56:08]. Demand is projected to grow significantly from developing economies like India and Indonesia [56:58].
*   **Short-Term Cautious (Conventional View)**: Concerns about the Chinese property market slowdown [57:25].
*   **Adam Rosenke's View**: Short-term bullish (next 3-4 years) due to tight mine supply and demand from India and Indonesia [58:23]. The "Green Revolution" is an additional demand driver [58:42].
*   **Long-Term Cautious (Adam Rosenke's View)**: New technologies being developed, particularly by Robert Friedland of Ivanhoe Mines, could dramatically increase supply and reduce capital intensity [59:06]. Examples include new exploration methods and more efficient rock processing, which could reduce energy consumption in mining by up to 90% [01:00:15]. This could lead to a significant "supply response" later this decade, similar to the SX/EW technology in the 1990s which added 20% to copper supply [01:00:08].
*   **Recent Price Decline**: The recent decline in copper prices (from $5.20 to $4/lb) and rising inventories are attributed to unexpected mine supply growth in the first six months of the year, driven by restarts and new projects (e.g., Kamoa Kakula in DRC) [01:01:05].
*   **China Copper Consumption**: Historically, China's high copper consumption (50% of global demand) was often considered "overconsumption" relative to its GDP. However, analysis of total installed copper base (rather than annual consumption) showed China was largely on trend line [01:02:40]. More recently, however, China's installed copper base has risen above trend line, potentially due to green energy pushes or military buildups [01:03:38]. This is a key question for future demand [01:04:29].

### Demographics
Demographics, while seemingly predictable ("slow motion train wrecks"), have a history of confounding expectations (e.g., 1970s overpopulation fears vs. current underpopulation concerns) [01:06:20]. While not a direct driver for specific trades, demographic trends (like China's one-child policy impact on population size) are integrated into models for projecting per capita demand and overall population-driven demand for commodities [01:07:06].

### Oil and Natural Gas
*   **Oil**: The recent decline in oil prices (from $80 to $68 WTI) is seen as position unwinding rather than a fundamental shift [01:13:07]. Inventory levels in the US and globally are drawing, indicating strengthening fundamentals [01:13:15].
*   **US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)**: The US SPR has been significantly drawn down, from approximately 650 million barrels in 2020 to 340 million barrels by 2023 [01:16:47]. As of September 2024, it stands at around 375 million barrels, having stopped selling and begun refilling modestly [01:17:02].
*   **US Natural Gas**: US gas production is "plummeting," down 5% (5 BCF per day) in the first seven months of the year, which is unprecedented [01:14:08]. This is rapidly repairing the inventory overhang from a mild winter, moving the market balancing prediction from mid-2025 to December of the current year [01:14:21].
*   **US Shale Oil**: US shale oil production, including the Permian, has rolled over since December 2023, declining about 1% [01:14:56]. This means the only source of non-OPEC oil supply growth over the last 15 years is now in decline, a historical precursor to a significant move higher in oil prices [01:15:19].
*   **China LNG Demand**: China's natural gas consumption is "behind trend line" relative to its wealth, suggesting a "constant bid" for LNG in the market, implying that new US LNG exports will be absorbed quickly [01:12:12]. This contradicts earlier predictions of an overwhelmed market [01:11:21].

Contrary to common belief, commodity bull markets and [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] are primarily generated by low-income groups rather than high-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. This phenomenon challenges the perception that low-income populations are the most vulnerable to [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

## How Low-Income Groups Drive Commodity Inflation

[[Commodity Markets and Economic Impacts | Commodities]] operate in "volumetric markets," meaning their prices are dictated by the quantity consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. A bullish trend in [[Commodity Markets and Economic Impacts | oil]] or copper, for example, is a straightforward result of demand exceeding supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

Low-income groups collectively control the *volume* of commodities consumed globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. While high-income individuals control substantial financial capital, they are too few in number to numerically influence the physical consumption of goods like corn or [[Commodity Markets and Economic Impacts | oil]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. The consumption of staple commodities like corn is relatively uniform across income brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

Furthermore, hoarding vast quantities of physical goods like corn or [[Commodity Markets and Economic Impacts | oil]] by high-income individuals is logistically and numerically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. The only commodity wealthy individuals could realistically hoard is gold, due to its high density and ease of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Therefore, the ability to create physical good [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] rests solely with low-income groups through their collective consumption patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

## Contrasting Financial Inflation

Financial markets, including equity markets and GDP, are "dollar markets" where value is quoted in monetary terms (billions or trillions of dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. In these markets, concepts like interest rates and discount factors are crucial for valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. High-income groups control significant financial capital and can, therefore, create [[monetary_vs_high_street_inflation | financial inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Historical Examples

History provides clear examples of this dynamic:
*   The 2000s commodity bull market was primarily driven by the rising consumption of 400 million low-income rural Chinese citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.
*   The 1970s commodity story was fueled by the "War on Poverty" policies, which increased demand from lower-income segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.

## Policy Implications

Current [[inflation_and_economic_policies | policy makers]] often exacerbate the problem by simultaneously hindering supply and accentuating demand from low-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>. For instance, in Europe, windfall profit taxes on energy companies, which reduce their incentive to invest in supply, are redistributed to lower-income households. This policy both worsens the supply problem and boosts demand, thereby contributing to higher [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

The interplay between decarbonization efforts and [[demographics_and_labor_force_impacts_on_inflation | income inequality]] is becoming increasingly critical in the commodity space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. [[challenges_of_managing_inflation_through_monetary_policy | Monetary policies]] focused on supply-side economics have historically sent money to higher-income groups, where it becomes sequestered and has zero velocity, leading to secular deflation by creating efficient goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. However, the current fiscal response to [[demographics_and_labor_force_impacts_on_inflation | inequality]] has a velocity of one, directly fueling [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

Technological advancements have had a profound and often debated impact on the global economy, influencing everything from labor markets and commodity prices to inflation and wealth distribution. The long-term effects of these advancements are complex, with arguments for both deflationary and potentially inflationary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

## Deflationary Impacts of Technology

For several decades, a [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | free market economic system]] driven by central bank monetary policy has fueled a technological revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. This has led to an essentially free flow of money to corporations and wealthy individuals, encouraging long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This environment has broadly contributed to a deflationary trend, particularly over the last 20 years, as [[Impact of Technology on Economy and Media | technology]] has accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Corporations, seeking to reduce costs and compete, have also driven globalization, further contributing to deflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Money printed through monetary policy often goes to corporations and the wealthy, rather than directly to consumers, which limits its inflationary impact on the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

One argument for technology being deflationary stems from its impact on the labor force. While a shrinking labor force might seem to suggest upward wage pressure, the economy is shifting towards a highly technological regime, moving away from an industrial one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. In the 1970s, a U.S. company needed ten times more employees to generate $1 million in sales than it does today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>. This trend is expected to continue due to [[Impact of AI on employment and investment | technological advancements]] and robotization, meaning that even with a smaller labor force, the demand for labor may decrease over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

Similarly, discussions around [[Technological advancements and their effects on commodity prices | commodity prices]], particularly concerning ESG goals and the demand for materials like copper, often overlook the potential for technological innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. It is argued that over the next 20 to 30 years, innovation will lead to more efficient use of commodities, requiring less raw material than current technology suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>.

### Monetary Policy and Deflation
Quantitative Easing (QE) is considered deflationary because the money created has no velocity in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Bank reserves created by QE remain stuck in the interbank system or are given to institutions like pension funds, which primarily buy other financial instruments rather than circulating the money into the real economy to purchase goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## Inflationary Pressures and Technology

Despite technology's deflationary tendencies, other factors interact with it to create inflationary pressures. Direct fiscal transfers to households, especially during lockdowns, can be highly inflationary by forcing consumers to buy physical goods instead of services, exacerbating issues in already stressed supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

While technology is secular and will always advance, there is a cautious view against assuming an accelerated pace of [[Impact of AI and technology on financial markets | technological advancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>. The speed of innovation can slow when the "lifeblood of advancement"—money and access to resources—is constrained, which can happen during periods of populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

### Demographic Changes and Technology
The relationship between [[Demographic changes and their economic implications | demographics]] and inflation is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. While a shrinking labor force might lead to increased wages and stronger unions, the overall shift towards a more technological economy could counteract this by reducing the overall demand for labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>.

The concept of a growing "dependency ratio" (more elderly dependents relative to the working population) can be seen as inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. Care for the elderly represents a mandatory cost for governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. However, it's also argued that as the dependency ratio increases, the average worker may save more to secure their future, leading to lower interest rates rather than higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>.

### Structural vs. Cyclical Inflation
Inflation can be viewed from both structural and cyclical perspectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:35]</a>. While structural factors might suggest ongoing inflationary pressures (e.g., potential for direct transfers, deglobalization, ESG), cyclical factors, such as lack of credit growth, a slowing economic cycle, and easing supply chains, currently point towards slowing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

### Wealth Inequality
The long period of monetary policy-driven growth, while fostering [[Impact of Technology on Economy and Media | technological revolution]], has also created massive wealth inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The "everything rally" of recent decades has primarily benefited older generations who held significant assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. This has led to a push for wealth redistribution, potentially through taxation of wealth gains, to address inequality and stimulate broader economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.

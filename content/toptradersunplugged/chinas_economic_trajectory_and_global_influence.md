China, despite facing significant structural problems, is showing some early, counterintuitive signs of improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>. This comes at a time when there is a 50-year type dislocation relative to assets like the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. The prevailing sentiment has seen many abandon [[Chinas economic policies and market impact | Chinese assets]] for the long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>.

## Potential Shift in US Policy Towards China

A significant factor to watch is the potential stance of a new Trump administration towards China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. While the perception is that a Trump administration would be tough on China, based on his previous presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>, there are clues that this might not be the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

### Russia-China Alliance

When Trump left office in 2020, Russia and China were not allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>. However, in February 2022, before Russia invaded Ukraine, they issued a joint communiqu√©, publicly announcing their alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. This document is seen as a critical statement of a changing global dynamic, with Russia and China now "connected at the hip" as allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>. Given Trump's strong pro-Russia stance, it's possible he might not be as aggressive against China as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>.

### Trump's Geopolitical Clues

Trump has provided several clues regarding his potential approach:
*   **Taiwan:** He has stated that if Taiwan wants the US to defend them, it will come at a cost, implying they would need to pay for military support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. This is seen as a sign of his transactional approach to foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.
*   **Tariffs:** There are indications that his tariffs might not primarily focus on China, but rather on countries like Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>. This could be rhetoric to maintain his "tariff man" image while potentially seeking a deal with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.
*   **Isolationism:** The "America First" policy extends beyond simply prioritizing America; it suggests a reduced willingness to engage in global conflicts or stand up to aggression from nations like Russia or China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>.

### The "Nixon Moment" Analogy

The situation is likened to the "Nixon moment" when President Nixon opened up relations with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. Only a figure like Trump, who is perceived as tough, might be able to "make a deal" with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. In the short term, such a deal could be economically supportive for the US and help manage inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

### Asymmetric Trade Opportunity

There is a potential asymmetric trade opportunity in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. While some may see a low probability (e.g., 2%) of a significant shift, others believe it could be as high as 30-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:45">[00:54:45]</a>. The magnitude of such a mean reversion trade could be one of the biggest in a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. This suggests considering convexity or a barbell strategy for potential upside in [[Chinas economic policies and market impact | Chinese assets]] as a hedge against inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:10">[00:55:10]</a>. The odds of this happening are considered higher than many realize, with "clues" in the changing macroeconomic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>.

### Elon Musk's Influence

Elon Musk is expected to play a significant role in influencing the narrative, especially regarding a new administration's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>. His platform, now X (formerly Twitter), gives him a powerful "microphone" to push narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>. Musk's incentives may align with pushing a narrative that supports a short-term "fix" or deal with China, potentially leading to a shift in public and administrative sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. This influence could create more volatility and dispersion in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

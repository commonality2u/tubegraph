Andreas F. Clenow, a veteran hedge fund manager and author, emphasizes the critical role of simplicity in [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading systems]] and the indispensable nature of programming skills for anyone serious about the trading business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Simplicity in Systematic Trading Strategies

Clenow argues that adding complexity to a trading model is only worthwhile if it significantly increases profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Otherwise, complexity can make execution more difficult, reduce the likelihood of success, and lead to over-optimization where the model is perfectly fitted to past data but fails in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. He cautions against using numerous indicators that "have to be working together" as this often results in a system that "is just happy to work because you optimize that you fitted perfectly to to the recent past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

His first book, "Following the Trend," aimed to present a very simple [[systematic_trading_strategies | trading model]] to describe the general approach of the [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Clenow's biggest regret is not making it even simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He later learned from a peer, Nicolas Darvas, that a 12-month return rule—comparing today's price to the price a year ago—could yield even better results than the model presented in his book, demonstrating that "the simpler [[systematic_trading_systems | systems]] are usually the better ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. This simple rule involves checking if today's price is higher than a year ago; if so, one goes long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>.

### Distinguishing Simplicity from Over-optimization

Clenow stresses that focusing on "the most tiny details" and striving for "perfection" in indicators or parameters is a misconception, especially prevalent in the technical analysis (TA) school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. He notes that institutional traders and hedge fund managers do not typically spend time optimizing "ten indicators that is combining two to get to the perfect buying signals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Instead, they focus on exploiting a specific market phenomenon with a robust, simple approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

He acknowledges that [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following rules]] are usually not complex in theory, making them "easy to implement" in a simulation platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. However, he distinguishes this from real-world execution, which involves combining multiple models and managing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

## The Importance of Programming Skills

Clenow views programming skills as "absolutely vital in this business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. He emphasizes that even if one aspires to be a hedge fund manager with a large staff of programmers, "you have to learn at least basic programming" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. His own journey into systematic trading began by building trading systems in the mid-nineties using platforms like MetaStock and TradeStation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. He even built a point and figure plotter in Excel that read real-time data from Reuters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

His experience in developing prototypes for others enabled him to transition into the hedge fund space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. He states that "programming skills are absolutely vital in this business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This skill allows for the development, testing, and implementation of [[systematic_trading_strategies | trading ideas]], which was crucial when he first started managing money for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## [[systematic_trading_vs_expert_intuition | Systematic Trading vs. Expert Intuition]]

Clenow advocates for a [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | rule-based approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. He notes that while "you can't just blindly follow the rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a> and critical thinking is necessary for extreme market events like the Swiss franc floor removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>, [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic systems]] still provide the backbone.

Clenow explains that the "main focus" in the CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) industry today is "to combine strategies to reduce volatility to find ways to to cover the the draw downs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, incorporating methods like carry strategies, calendar spreads, and counter-trend models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. This points to a blended approach where [[philosophies_of_systematic_trading | systematic methods]] are combined to create robust portfolios.

The core principle behind [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following models]] on futures, according to Clenow, is diversification: "most markets fails fail most the time that's the time but there will always be something they will produce enough profits to make up for it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. This reinforces the need for a [[systematic_macro_trading_approach | systematic macro trading approach]] that can handle a broad universe of instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

Clenow’s insights underscore that while the underlying concepts of [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] can be simple, their effective implementation and management in the real world require not only a disciplined, [[the_role_of_discipline_and_systematic_methods_in_trading | rule-based approach]] but also strong programming skills. These skills enable traders to build, test, and adapt their systems, navigating market complexities and ensuring the robustness of their investment strategies. The emphasis on simplicity helps avoid over-optimization, making strategies more likely to perform well over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

The discussion delves into the unique position of U.S. Treasuries within global finance, the impact of strategic treasury issuance decisions, and the broader macroeconomic factors influencing bond [[performance_and_challenges_in_bond_and_fixed_income_markets | market performance]] and [[understanding_and_valuing_treasuries | treasury yields]].

## The Indispensable Role of US Treasuries

The U.S. Dollar and Treasury market possess unique characteristics that make them indispensable for storing and facilitating large-scale transactions and savings globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. There is no viable alternative that is sufficiently large, deep, and liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The gold market is not large enough, and even observed flows have caused gold prices to soar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Many crypto assets have deflationary designs, with supply declining over time, which is unsuitable for funding increasing transactions and savings that require an expanding supply, unlike the growing [[understanding_and_valuing_treasuries | Treasury market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This lack of alternatives leaves many entities "stuck" with the dollar and treasury, despite potential preferences to cease their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Expert Insight: Steve Moran

Steve Moran, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and Senior Strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, provides insights into [[global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | global macro-driven markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. His background includes economic policy advisory at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, portfolio management at Sarum Capital, and work at Fidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Moran entered the markets after pursuing a Ph.D. in economics, drawn by the opportunity to engage with top-level, high-order issues that drive [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | markets]] and important economic and policy changes on a daily basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Activist Treasury Issuance (ATI)

### Background and Thesis

In a widely discussed paper with Nouriel Roubini titled "Activist Treasury Issuance and the Tug of War Over Monetary Policy," Steve Moran explored why financial markets and the economy have remained resilient despite historic monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Many would have predicted a "financial apocalypse" had they known the Fed would move from significant quantitative easing (QE) to quantitative tightening (QT) and hike policy rates by nearly 5.5% rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. However, growth has been strong, and [[2023_financial_market_analysis_and_trends | markets phenomenal]], with inflation remaining stubbornly high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

While acknowledging multiple causes, Moran highlights that "activist treasury issuance" (ATI) has been a significant, yet less discussed, policy change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The paper's thesis is that the Treasury has been "tactical" in its issuance, preferring to issue more short-term bills and fewer longer-duration bonds to avoid putting upward pressure on long-term yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This strategy is estimated to have an economic impact equivalent to a 1% cut in the Fed funds rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Economic Channel and Impact

The economic channel of ATI is very similar to the Fed's QE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Both QE and ATI work by altering the distribution of debt held by the public, shifting from assets with [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | interest rate risk]] to those without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

*   **Treasury Bills vs. Bank Reserves**: Treasury bills are now very close substitutes for Bank Reserves at the Fed, especially in the post-Basel world, bearing similar duration, credit, regulatory, and return profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **QE Mechanism**: The Fed buys interest-rate-risk-bearing debt, exchanging it for Bank Reserves, effectively providing "money" and reducing risk in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **ATI Mechanism**: ATI limits the creation of risk-bearing notes and bonds at the Treasury source, issuing more bills instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

In both cases, the public receives more money or money-like bills, increasing the money supply and reducing the supply of interest-rate-risk-bearing securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This aligns with the "portfolio balance channel," where a fixed appetite for risk leads investors to seek other forms of risk when interest rate risk is removed (e.g., shifting from treasuries to corporate credit, then to stocks, etc.), stimulating [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | markets]] and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Moran emphasizes that ATI has profoundly impacted markets and the economy, contributing to their buoyancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. While the impact of QE is debated, Moran argues that QE and ATI must either both work or neither work, given their similar mechanisms. He views the Fed's stance that QT has no effects while QE does as "quite silly cognitive dissonance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Treasury Issuance Policy

### Treasury's Approach vs. Market Timing

The Treasury's long-standing policy framework dictates that it is *not* a market timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Its objective is to achieve the lowest cost to taxpayers over the long term (decades), not to time short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This is partly due to the risk of misjudging market cycles; for much of the past year and a half, predictions of Fed cuts and rapidly declining [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rates]] have been incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

### Future Issuance and "Term Out" Risk

A significant downside of ATI is the "term out" risk, meaning the Treasury will eventually need to shift from issuing short-term bills to longer-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This unwinding could raise yields at an inopportune time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>. The IMF recently flagged this risk in its financial stability report, noting the overextended reliance on short-term issuance raises the risk of higher [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | interest rates]] down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

However, Moran doesn't believe term-out risk is currently driving the recent increase in yields, largely because the future direction of policy is uncertain given potential changes in Treasury leadership post-election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Recent yield increases are attributed to the Fed misjudging the cycle and increasing expectations of future deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

Regarding upcoming refunding announcements, Moran expects no dramatic surprises, as the Treasury has consistently guided against increasing nominal coupon auctions for several quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. He compares this to the later stages of QE, where it ceases to be a market event until there's an indication of tapering or a shift to QT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

## Financial Market Dynamics

### Treasury General Account and Liquidity

The Treasury General Account (TGA), the Treasury's balance at the Fed, plays a crucial role in market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. Spending down the TGA is a "huge liquidity injection to financial markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>. This is because the Treasury stops issuing new debt and converts public savings (analogous to money stuffed in a mattress) into private sector expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

The Fiscal Responsibility Act suspended the debt limit, but this suspension expires at the end of the year, binding again around January 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. However, the Treasury's general account, projected to hold around $700 billion at year-end, along with "Extraordinary Measures" (borrowing from other government funds), is expected to push the "do-or-die" debt limit date out until possibly the third quarter of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>.

### Medium-Term Outlook for Fixed Income

On a medium-term basis, Moran expresses concern for the bond market unless deficits are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. Deficits are the fundamental driver of high bond supply and are expected to weigh on [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. While the "term out" of bills could be significant, its timing is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:35">[00:54:35]</a>. The more critical issue is the deficit itself, which impacts the supply of bonds and perceptions of the soundness of [[understanding and valuing treasuries | treasury markets]] and government finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

The U.S. faces accelerating concerns over fiscal solvency, with Social Security and Medicare trust funds projected to expire in 2033 and 2034, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. Decisions will be necessary as the government will be unable to meet all obligations with current revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.

## Global Role of US Treasuries

Despite [[geopolitical concerns and their influence on financial markets | geopolitical concerns]], Moran does not currently see a significant risk to the dollar's standing or demand for Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. The U.S. Treasury and dollar markets remain uniquely liquid, reliable, and deep, capable of absorbing large transactions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>. There's no comparable alternative for parking assets securely, offering a reliable return, as evidenced by gold market surges from even minor flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.

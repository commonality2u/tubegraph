Aspect Capital's investment approach emphasizes a highly diversified and systematically managed portfolio. The firm is committed to delivering quality medium-term trend following returns to its institutional and broader client base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Diversified Program Structure

Aspect Capital's "Diversified program" has evolved to predominantly focus on medium-term trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. They avoid changing model weights or introducing other models during challenging periods, as their commitment is to consistent trend following returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The portfolio is structured as follows:
*   **Trend Following Models** Eighty percent (80%) of the portfolio is focused on these models, trading over 150 markets and multiple contracts within many of them, amounting to approximately 180 to 200 instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Complementary Models** The remaining twenty percent (20%) of the risk is allocated to "modulating factors" or "complementary models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These models are designed to:
    *   "Take some of the rough edges off of trend following" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   Take advantage of orthogonal or [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | diversifying effects]] that possess a similar level of persistence or traction as the momentum component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Capture other factors, such as relative momentum between instruments, carry effects in FX, fixed income, or equities, and dynamics of the term structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These strategies often involve faster market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The firm continuously evolves and improves its core trend following approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Portfolio Weighting and Agnostic Outlook

Aspect Capital's starting point for [[portfolio_construction_and_protection | portfolio construction]] is a very agnostic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. They reject the worldview that historical performance can predict near-future performance for specific asset classes (e.g., bonds performing well in the past means they will continue to perform) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Their objective is to achieve the most agnostic [[portfolio_construction_and_protection | portfolio construction]] possible, ideally an even spread of sectors if not for liquidity or [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlation constraints]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Key aspects of their weighting strategy include:
*   **Broad Diversification** A starting place is broad [[diversification_and_portfolio_management | diversification]] across seven internal sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Modulation** This agnostic [[diversification_and_portfolio_management | diversification]] is adjusted based on:
    *   Long-term structural [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlation]] between markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
    *   Liquidity characteristics of the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This review is regular, and portfolio allocation gently flexes around different liquidity profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Constraints** They impose conservative constraints on position size relative to average daily volume or open interest, as well as limits for "tail events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This process systematically determines the allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Despite these careful considerations, there is still "considerable capacity" for the program to grow without needing to change its fundamental structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. They monitor how different features change the [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlation structure]] and potential market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Risk Management in Portfolio Construction

Risk management is a holistic challenge that involves how all component pieces are put together and how the overall portfolio is risk-managed to determine end performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Volatility
Positions are a function of signal strength and conviction, modulated by the perceived risk (volatility) of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. If market volatility doubles, the position size will effectively halve to maintain the same risk for a given signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. There isn't an "inexorable line" where a stronger trend always leads to a bigger position; knowing "when to back off" and potentially provide liquidity is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This approach means they do not use a hard stop-loss; instead, the signal gradually modulates the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

### Defining and Managing Risk
Aspect Capital considers several measures of risk, beyond just Value at Risk (VaR), to avoid inflating positions during periods of low volatility, which could lead to "unpleasant surprises" when volatility returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. They are also very focused on operational risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### Model Risk and Review Process
Model risk is addressed through a robust peer review process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. A dedicated risk team, as experienced and smart as the researchers, is tasked with "shredding" the best research that emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

The formal risk review process involves:
*   **Component-level Review** Every new component idea (e.g., evolution of trend following, new modulating strategy, execution algorithm amendment, portfolio construction methodology change) is examined in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. This includes using out-of-sample data, synthetic data, and examining hypotheses or failure cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.
*   **Holistic Release Review** Typically, there are three program releases per year, aggregating various tweaks and new components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. The risk team reviews the dynamics of the overall release, ensuring all pieces work together and that the program wouldn't have led to unmanageable positions or client intervention in past market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

### Addressing Drawdowns and Investor Psychology
Drawdowns are an inherent part of any strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>. For investors, understanding that a drawdown in a trend following strategy is not necessarily an open-ended risk is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Investors often make the mistake of buying at highs and selling at lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

The key to managing investor comfort during drawdowns is ensuring they have understood the role of managed futures in their broader [[portfolio_diversification_and_risk_management | portfolio diversification and risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. If a strategy is included for its [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | diversification]] properties (e.g., from equities and bonds), then its uncorrelated behavior — making money when equities plummet, or losing money when equities boom — is part of its expected function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Investors must be comfortable with this idiosyncratic risk and view it within the context of their overall portfolio, rather than fixating on a single line item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. Sticking with a well-constructed strategy that exposes one to various risk premiums (equity, carry, value) is vital, as no single factor will work all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

Managers should focus on explaining *why* they do what they do, rather than just *how* or *what*, to build investor belief and make difficult conversations easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>.

## Long-Term Evolution and Challenges

Aspect Capital's research team continuously evolves and develops the program across four areas: core trend following components, diversifying modulating strategies, [[portfolio_construction_and_protection | portfolio construction]] and [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | risk management]], and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

Key challenges and opportunities include:
*   **Market Impact** Early on, their trading was too visible, leading to market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. They developed execution strategies to "dribble" trades into markets in random pieces with random delays, exploiting volatility rather than forcing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Technological Evolution** The transition to a predominantly electronic "box-to-box" trading world has been a significant research and investment commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Their execution algorithms aim to be "invisible" and capture a "patient premium," not engaging in high-frequency trading (HFT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>. They monitor and re-parameterize algorithms based on changing market characteristics like bid-offer spreads and clip sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.
*   **Liquidity in Crisis** Concerns about liquidity drying up, as seen in 2008-2009, are addressed by having multiple clearing houses and prime broker relationships to ensure operational robustness and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. They also monitor and include new markets, such as non-deliverable forward currencies, to expand opportunity and diversify liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Market Correlations** [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | Correlations]] are crucial for both opportunity set and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. While there have been periods of secular increase in correlation, they believe the world is becoming a more diverse set of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>, maintaining the prospect of having [[global_investing_and_the_importance_of_diversification | diversification]].
*   **Industry Evolution** The fund management industry is evolving, with fee pressures and a demand for "pure factor" exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. This is seen as a natural evolution and an opportunity for managed futures to become more available and integrated into "model portfolios" for a broader range of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>.
*   **Impact of Size** As the firm grew to manage billions of dollars and employ many people, the mindset naturally became more risk-averse, reflecting a fiduciary responsibility to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This shift is balanced by trusting a talented team and maintaining a "childlike enthusiasm and energy" for new information and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.
*   **Talent and Competition** While a small percentage of firms manage most assets, there is a risk that smaller firms struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. However, as performance returns and appetite for managed futures improves, smaller managers will have opportunities, supported by seeding funds and funds-of-funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:40">[00:50:40]</a>. This is viewed as a Darwinian process where new substantial businesses will develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Investors and Managers

For investors, a key question to ask managers is how they articulate putting all the pieces together, how they approach [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | risk management]], and how they plan to evolve their program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>. The ability to evolve the program is crucial for long-standing firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>.

For aspiring or smaller managers, crucial advice includes:
*   **Be True to Yourself** Hone your unique skills, whether discretionary or systematic. If a manager claims to be 95% systematic but has a discretionary overlay, they are "100% discretionary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.
*   **Integrity of Models** Ensure models are robust enough not to require discretionary intervention during extreme events, as this undermines model integrity and backtest usefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:13">[00:57:13]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach** Success comes from the combination of all pieces (models, markets) and effective risk management, not just individual models or time scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Teamwork and Collaboration** Recognizing the value of teamwork, collaboration, and trust in skilled colleagues is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>.
*   **Continuous Improvement** A rigorous risk review process that challenges every component and the aggregated program ensures robust performance under various scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>.

The future of systematic trading, and specifically managed futures, is less about the "genius of the trader" or a "cult of personality" and more about the repeatability, robustness, thoroughness, and extensibility of the approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>. Systematic trading is seen as core to a well-balanced [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio | portfolio]], with a shift towards [[diversification_and_portfolio_management | diversified portfolios]] from numerous shops rather than single providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

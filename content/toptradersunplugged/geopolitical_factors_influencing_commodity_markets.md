The current global landscape suggests that a significant [[Geopolitical and macroeconomic factors influencing markets | monetary regime change]] is imminent, signaling a potential major reset in commodity prices and a substantial bull market that could last 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This shift is not merely coincidental but part of a larger causal system influencing real asset valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Historical Context of Monetary Regime Changes and Commodity Cycles

Historically, major bottoms in commodity and real asset markets, which preceded new bull markets, have coincided with significant changes in the global monetary regime system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

*   **End of the Gold Standard (1929-1933):** The stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent depression marked the end of the gold standard, a monetary regime change in place since the Napoleonic Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. The US Federal Reserve's controversial policies of quantitative easing in the 1920s to devalue the dollar contributed to the stock market boom, but their reversal after Benjamin Strong's death led to the crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **End of Bretton Woods (1968-1971):** The period when commodities bottomed and then took off corresponds with the end of the Bretton Woods system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. While Richard Nixon closed the gold window in 1971, the effective end of dollar convertibility to gold was initiated by President Johnson in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This was a significant [[impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_global_markets | volatility shock]] to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **LTCM Fallout (1999):** The aftermath of the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) crisis led to Asian currencies devaluing against the dollar, resulting in trillions of dollars in US treasuries flowing East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This created the "dollar recycling standard" which is now likely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. This too constituted a massive [[Geopolitical influences on financial markets | monetary regime change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Landscape and its Influence

The "Doomsday Clock" for a [[geopolitical_and_macroeconomic_factors_influencing_markets | monetary regime change]] is currently at 11:59, indicating extreme proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. This shift is expected to trigger a bull market in resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

### Shifting Power Dynamics

*   **BRICS Nations:** For several years, it was anticipated that BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) would be the agents of change, seeking a rival to the US dollar for international trade settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. While progress has been made with a significant portion of global commodity trade moving away from the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>, the full impact of a new major currency from BRICS nations, possibly backed by gold, is still unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
*   **United States Internal Policy:** The most likely catalyst for change in the global monetary system could now come from the United States itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. Proposals such as monetizing the Fed's balance sheet or revaluing Treasury's gold holdings (currently valued at $42 an ounce, far below market price) could be revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. New tariff systems also indicate a departure from previous norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. The existing US dollar recycling standard, which emerged post-LTCM, is considered largely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

The potential for a "burn it down" regime, characterized by populist and protectionist policies, can bring disruptive figures who force change, even if the outcome is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

### Security of Supply vs. Weaponization

While some policies might seem like "weaponizing commodities," a more accurate assessment is a renewed appreciation for the fragility of raw material supply lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>.

*   **Historical Precedent:** The concept of securing commodity supplies due to [[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | geopolitical factors]] is not new. During World War II, major moves were made to secure energy supplies, particularly by Japan and Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **Rare Earths:** A prime example of commodity "weaponization" was China's restriction of rare earth metal output to Japan around 2010 for geopolitical leverage, aimed at acquiring manufacturing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>.
*   **Strategic Stockpiles:** The US historically maintained strategic stockpiles of various materials through the Cold War, but these were largely liquidated, leading to current vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. Efforts are now being made to re-establish domestic supply for critical materials like antimony and uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.

## Impact on Specific Commodities

### Oil and Gas

*   **US Shale Production:** The US has been the primary driver of global oil supply growth for the last 15 years, with shale contributing nine-tenths of new demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, US shale growth has now turned negative, with most basins in sustained decline except the Permian, which is nearing zero growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. US gas production has also turned negative, declining by 2-3% year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **OPEC's Role:** Historically, the US experienced a decline in oil production around 1970-1971, which gave OPEC significant pricing power and allowed them to use oil as a weapon in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>. The current decline in US production could lead to a similar dynamic, making the US vulnerable despite past "energy independence" claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>.
*   **European Energy Vulnerability:** Europe is in a difficult energy position, with Germany de-industrializing due to energy program mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. While US LNG exports have provided some stability, the US gas market is in deficit, and increasing domestic AI demand will likely prioritize US needs over cheap European gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>. This could lead to a scenario where Russian gas flows back to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

### Uranium

*   **Supply Deficit:** The uranium market is in a sharp deficit, with insufficient new capacity brought online in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. This is partly due to underestimated nuclear power plant extensions and new build programs in countries like China and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Concentration:** Major uranium production comes from Kazakhstan (which has Russian military presence and is considered "gray" geopolitically) and Canada (an allied nation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:42">[01:11:42]</a>. The US is not a major producer or enrichment facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. A strategic move by Russia in Kazakhstan could be a "Black Swan" event for the uranium market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:53">[01:12:53]</a>.

### Gold

*   **Price Dynamics:** Gold prices are making new all-time highs despite almost no Western participation, primarily driven by central bank buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. Western investors tend to be procyclical, chasing price, which could lead to further demand if prices continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. Central banks are price agnostic and buy based on policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin Comparison:** Unlike gold, Bitcoin's supply is not projected to grow in line with GDP, raising questions about its long-term viability as a real store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. Bitcoin's high energy consumption also poses sustainability concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. In a carry trade unwind, Bitcoin, which has traded like a tech stock, might not offer the same protective exposure as gold, an anti-carry trade asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Outlook and Risk Assessment

The global market is characterized by a "carry trade" where real assets lose their luster relative to abstract, high-multiple growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>. This trade is self-reinforcing due to sustained liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. However, the timing for a shift is approaching rapidly, potentially within six to eighteen months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

The catalyst for an unwind of this carry trade and a return to real asset prominence will likely be a "volatility shock" that changes the underlying system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. This could manifest as a narrative change, where people lose faith in existing trends, or a significant shock like an [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_global_markets | Emerging Market crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. Given the high levels of leverage in the system and the potential for significant policy changes, a crisis leading to a forced unwind of the carry trade is a high probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

> [!info] Investment Perspective
> While commodities have been cheap relative to financial assets since 2015, indicating an opportune time for long-term investors, the current environment suggests that timing is now becoming critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Being early on these trades has historically not incurred significant costs, but missing the move when it comes off the bottom can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Diversified portfolios that primarily consist of financial assets (stocks, bonds, private equity) are largely caught in the same "carry trade" and are not as diversified as investors might believe, making them vulnerable to a market-wide unwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Natural resources, by contrast, are not in this basket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.

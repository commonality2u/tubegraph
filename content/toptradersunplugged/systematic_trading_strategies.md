[[systematic_trading_systems | Systematic trading systems]] are [[rulebased_trading_strategies | rulebased trading strategies]] to financial markets that aim to remove human emotion and ego from investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. These strategies rely on a set of predefined rules or algorithms that dictate when and how to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

## Core Principles

A fundamental principle of [[systematic trading strategies | systematic trading strategies]] is their non-predictive nature; practitioners do not claim to have insight into future prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. Instead, they are based on probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:02">[00:56:02]</a>. This approach stands in contrast to the idea of "hot-handed traders" or "pinstripe-suited soothsayers" who intimate special insight into tomorrow's prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

Key aspects include:
*   **Discipline and Patience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>: Strict adherence to the established rules is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   **Low Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>: Maintaining low leverage ensures the ability to "show up again tomorrow," preventing financial ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.
*   **Removal of Emotion and Ego** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>: These are considered "bad inputs" for trading strategies, leading to poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>.

Chris Cruden, founder and CEO of Inch Capital Management, emphasizes that [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | building and evaluating systematic trading strategies]] involves a strong belief in the solid and sensible nature of [[systematic_investment_strategies | systematic investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>. His mentors, Bob Tamiso and Larry Hite, both embraced entirely systematic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.

## Types of Systematic Currency Strategies

For currency systems, four main drivers exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>:
1.  **Interest Rate Differential (Carry Trade)**: This involves profiting from the difference in interest rates between two currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Historically, this has been the most successful driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. However, periods of low global interest rates significantly reduce its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.
2.  **Momentum Breakout** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
3.  **Volatility Trading** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
4.  **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Type Programs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

Inch Capital Management's currency program, Kintel, is primarily built on interest rate differential and momentum breakout, favoring the former by approximately 70/30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>.

## Evolution and Design of Kintel

Kintel, launched in 2000, maintains the core idea of [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic trading and trend following strategies]] in currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. It trades 16 major currency crosses, avoiding emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:22">[00:52:22]</a>. The program has not changed its fundamental structure over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

Key features of Kintel's design:
*   **Independent Algorithms for Each Cross**: Unlike older "one-size-fits-all" algorithms, Kintel uses a specific algorithm for each of the 16 currency crosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.
*   **Parameters Based on Market Characteristics**: The parameters for each model are set differently based on the unique characteristics of each currency pair, such as its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:55">[01:08:55]</a>.
*   **Risk Equivalency**: At the time of initiation, all trades are made to be risk equivalent, reflecting the non-predictive nature of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.
*   **Volatility-Based Exits**: An increase in volatility typically leads to an exit from a trade, while low volatility tends to initiate a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. This means a position can be exited due to volatility change, not just a reversal of the price trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

### Simplicity

Chris Cruden champions [[simplicity_in_trading_strategies | simplicity in trading strategies]], arguing against the industry's "love affair with perceived cleverness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. He notes that the rules are "remarkably simple" and could even be worked out by hand for older programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:21">[01:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

## Performance and Market Environment

### Track Record Presentation
Inch Capital presents its performance in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>:
1.  **Pure Alpha (1:1 leverage, no fees, no interest credit)**: Shows the raw performance of the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>.
2.  **Net of Fees (2/20) at 3x Leverage**: This reflects a higher-leverage, post-fee performance, with 3x leverage chosen as it provides a similar standard deviation to the S&P 500 but with substantially higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

### Impact of Market Environment
While the program remains consistent, its performance can be affected by the market environment. Periods of low volatility, such as the period leading up to late 2014, have been challenging for currency trend followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>. In such environments, "whipsawing" (frequent, small losses) can occur as trades are entered and exited quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>.

However, the belief is that markets will return to their historical behavior, and periods of suppressed volatility will be followed by jumps, which are favorable for genuine trend followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>. Central bank interventions, while significant, are viewed as unsustainable and ultimately ineffective in altering long-term market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

### Benefits to Portfolios
Though not designed for this purpose, Kintel has shown a strong positive benefit when included in an equity portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. Its positive months often coincide with negative months in equity markets, suggesting a diversification benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>. This might be due to currency markets being primarily driven by capital flow rather than individual stock movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

### Market Characteristics
Currency markets are characterized by high liquidity and transparency, which are considered crucial attributes for any investable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>. Inch Capital trades spot FX rather than futures, and has experienced no issues with liquidity or bank trust lines even during periods of market stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.

## Challenges for Systematic Trading Firms

[!WARNING|Faster Gunslinger Syndrome]
The industry can suffer from "groupthink," where investors chase the "new hot-handed guy" leading to quick rises and falls, often referred to as the "faster gunslinger syndrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:57">[00:37:57]</a>. This often results in managers changing their [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading systems]] to fit current market perceptions or marketing appeal, which can lead to being caught out when the environment shifts again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:44">[00:44:44]</a>.

[!INFO|CTAs vs. Hedge Funds]
Historically, firms like Inch Capital, which do not trade futures, have been considered "redheaded stepchildren" of both the managed futures (CTA) and hedge fund industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. The term "hedge fund" itself is often a misnomer, as there's often nothing to hedge in many of these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>.

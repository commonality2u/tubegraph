Systematic Alpha Management, co-founded by Peter Campbell and Alexei Chekhov, began operating in 2001 by managing individual accounts, and officially launched its fund in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Their strategy was pioneering at the time, as not many [[Shortterm trading strategies | short-term trading]] CTAs existed in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The firm's origins trace back to a broker-dealer Peter established in 1998 that traded tech stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The burst of the internet bubble in 2000, which caused a major Nasdaq collapse, spurred the need for a strategy that could perform well in any market environment, independent of the equity markets' direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategy and Founding Principles

Peter met Alexei Chekhov in 2000. Alexei had prior experience building models, including work at Trend Logic Associates, one of the original [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_trend_following_strategies | trend following]] CTAs, where he developed mean-reverting strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. He also performed fixed income spread trading at a French bank, which had similarities to their current approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. It took Peter and Alexei approximately a year (2000-2001) to develop their initial strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. The foundation of their current market-neutral program was established during this period of market decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. They adapted concepts from long/short equity, statistical arbitrage, and fixed income spread trading to major global equity indices and currency futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

Their CTA strategy is distinct from traditional [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_trend_following_strategies | trend-based managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Their correlation to other CTAs is near zero, indicating their unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>, although explaining this uncorrelated strategy to investors can be a [[challenges_in_trend_following_and_shortterm_trading | challenge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

## Importance of Research and Adaptability

Systematic Alpha Management dedicates significant resources to research and development, utilizing proprietary software for backtesting models with one-minute data resolution, going back many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This tool, continuously upgraded over seven to nine years, allows for various in-sample and out-of-sample analyses to ensure model robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Key Factors for Success

The core of their strategy is simple yet persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:39:00">[49:39:00]</a>. It exploits temporary divergences in highly correlated global equity markets, such as the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 futures, due to different time zones and intraday liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:52:00">[49:52:00]</a>. These are primarily liquidity-driven mispricings, not fundamental divergences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:14:00">[51:14:00]</a>. High volatility environments are beneficial because divergences tend to be larger and more frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:19:00">[51:19:00]</a>.

Even though their core concept has remained consistent for nearly 14 years, they continuously adjust to the ever-changing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:32:00">[53:32:00]</a>. This includes refining trade entry and exit timing, which is crucial for [[Shortterm trading strategies | short-term trading]] where even an hour's difference can significantly impact P&L <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>. For example, after 2011, they stopped trading certain European markets and added new ones that were under-looked but liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.

### The 2011 Drawdown and Adaptation

In 2011, Systematic Alpha Management experienced a significant drawdown, losing 90% of their assets due to investor redemptions, marking their only negative year on record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This period was particularly challenging due to the European debt crisis, which caused European equity indices to decline faster and with greater volatility than US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.

The firm made important modifications to their system following this experience, which contributed to their strong returns in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:00">[41:52:00]</a>. These adjustments included refining details like which markets to trade and precise buy/sell timings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:14:00">[42:14:00]</a>. Despite a similar challenging environment in the first half of 2012, their implemented adjustments allowed them to generate good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a>.

### Mitigation of Model Decay

While other [[Shortterm trading strategies | short-term managers]] often report that their models decay and require new ones every couple of years, Systematic Alpha Management's market-neutral approach helps maintain the longevity and robustness of their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:51:00">[48:51:00]</a>. The phenomenon they exploit—time zone differences and shifting intraday liquidity between global markets—is persistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>. They continually re-optimize parameters based on this core concept, which remains valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>. They also conduct statistical tests for mean reversion in spreads to monitor the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>.

## Spreads and Their Components

Their spread strategies are not simple pairs; they often involve a third leg, such as hedging currency exposure with a British Pound component when trading FTSE 100 and S&P 500 futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. Reversals in these spreads can occur through currency movements, equity market repricing, or a combination of both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

They also employ different types of spreads:
*   **Intra-market spreads:** For instance, trading Russell 2000 against Nasdaq 100, exploiting temporary divergences due to small-cap stocks reacting with a delay to large-cap moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>.
*   **Commodity-hedged spreads:** For indices highly correlated to commodities, such as the Canadian stock market, they use a commodity hedge (e.g., gold, copper, crude oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>.

Their average holding period for a position is approximately one day, or eight to ten trading hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:59:00">[57:59:00]</a>. Positions can be held for two or three days if a reversal doesn't occur quickly, and they employ hard stops or small reversals to exit losing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>. Their hit ratio of profitable trades averages about 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:21:00">[59:21:00]</a>. The strategy relies on strong predictability within a one-day horizon; beyond that, markets are efficient, and fundamental reasons, not liquidity reasons, drive divergences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:38:00">[59:38:00]</a>.

## Organizational Structure and Technology

The firm maintains all main functions in-house, including research, programming (for trading and back-office), compliance, and marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:14:00">[37:14:00]</a>. Their trading is fully automated, with traders monitoring executions rather than making discretionary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a>. They operate around the clock, trading European, Asian, and US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:00">[39:07:00]</a>. Currently, twelve people perform these tasks, with most having been with the firm for over five years, some for ten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>. Even with reduced headcount after 2011, increased automation has made the firm more efficient and improved service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>.

### Multi-Strategy Program

In 2011, following the challenges faced, Systematic Alpha Management introduced a second program: the Systematic Alpha Multi-Strategy fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>. This program was designed for greater [[Importance of diversification in trend following | diversification]], allocating 50% to their original spread trading program and 50% to directional momentum models (similar to [[challenges_and_adaptations_in_trend_following_strategies | short-term trend following]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:30:00">[24:30:00]</a>. The aim was to combine two uncorrelated return streams that exhibit negative correlation during times of stress for the spread component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:52:00">[34:52:00]</a>. This combination is intended to reduce the likelihood of large drawdowns, though it might increase correlation to CTAs and introduce some beta exposure to markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>.

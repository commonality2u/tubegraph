This article summarizes views on global macro trends, market forecasts, and the inherent [[risks_and_trends_in_current_investment_strategies | risks]] associated with them, as discussed by veteran hedge fund manager Niels Kaastrup-Larsen and guest Simon Hunt. It highlights the importance of understanding past performance limitations and significant financial loss potential in all [[systematic_investment_strategies | investment strategies]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>

## Introduction to Global Macro Analysis
The "Top Traders Unplugged" podcast's Global Macro Series aims to delve into the minds of prominent experts to understand the evolving global macro-driven world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The discussion emphasizes exploring perspectives on important issues and uncovering nuances through meaningful conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Simon Hunt's Background and Approach
Simon Hunt brings extensive experience, particularly from regions that the West currently faces challenges with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. His career began in central Africa's copper industry, followed by a move to London to join Anglo American Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. He then helped establish an international copper Development Association before entering the City of London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Hunt later founded Brook Hunt Associates, which was eventually acquired by Wood Mackenzie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Since then, he has developed a network of contacts with diverse disciplines, enabling him to make contrarian calls that have largely proven correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

Hunt's process for formulating forecasts is multi-faceted:
*   **Debt Levels** Debt has been central to his thinking since the 1970s, observing its consistent rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
*   **Central Banks and Governments** He closely monitors the actions of central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
*   **Global Network** Information is gathered from a network of friends and relations worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Analysis** For timing and the extent of turning points, Hunt collaborates closely with his technical associate at WaveTrack International, a partnership spanning 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Cycles** Hunt believes in various cycles, including the long-term Kondratiev cycle, shorter business cycles, and critically, the weather cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. Climate operates in long-term cycles of 40 to 70 years, driven by sunspot activity, volcanic activity, and changes in ocean temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. Many of these cycles are currently converging, which is expected to lead to significant shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

## Current Global Macro View and Predictions
Hunt foresees a new world order emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, marked by significant challenges and shifts.

### Geopolitical Landscape
*   **War in Europe** A dangerous intensification of the war between Russia and NATO (using Ukraine as a proxy) is expected in the coming weeks of Q4 2022, with a real risk of it becoming an outright war and spreading beyond Ukrainian borders by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.
*   **Asia - Taiwan/China** Hunt believes China does not wish to invade or blockade Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. However, there is a risk that America could push China across a "red line," such as supporting a Taiwanese independence referendum, which would compel China to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. Such an event would severely impact global semiconductor production, particularly from TSMC, potentially affecting the US more than China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.
    *   **China's Demographics** China faces a significant demographic challenge, with the number of employed people supporting retirees projected to drop from 14:1 in 1990 to 4:1 by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>. This drives the leadership's focus on technology, productivity, and robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
    *   **US Semiconductor Policy** Recent US policies aimed at curtailing China's growth are seen as an economic war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>. However, experts suggest there are ways around these moves, and China may be obtaining sophisticated chips through back channels, given the close business ties and large Taiwanese presence on the mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>.
*   **Middle East** Syria is a key area to watch, with potential for expansion into Iran, which could create volatile periods for oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.

### Economic and Financial Outlook
*   **Financial System Fragility** The global financial system, being highly leveraged, is expected to experience severe pain as central banks tighten credit and raise interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. Pockets of implosions are anticipated, forcing central banks to reverse course and add liquidity within the next three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation** A resurgence of inflation is foreseen, accompanied by significant increases in energy and food prices over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:18]</a>. US CPI is expected to exceed the 1980 figure of 13.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Food Prices** Food prices are at risk of "absolutely exploding upwards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a> due to denial of Russian and Ukrainian fertilizer and grain exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Climate changes, such as droughts caused by events like the Tonga underwater volcano, contribute to extreme temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. The Glesberg cycle (a drought cycle) is expected to hit around 2025, similar to the 1930s Dust Bowl in the US Midwest, further exacerbating food price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:00">[17:36:00]</a>. The FAO food price index, which averaged 95 in 2019, 126 in 2021, and 147 year-to-date in 2022, is projected to rise to 185 in 2024 and 220 in 2025, leading to soaring poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates** The 10-year US Treasury yield is projected to exceed 11% by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>. While the Fed controls the short end of the curve, the market (long end) is much larger and will be driven by rising inflation and a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>.
*   **Depression** The combination of ongoing war, a highly leveraged financial system, exploding inflation, and rising interest rates is expected to lead to a depression akin to the 1929-1932 era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.

### Market Projections
*   **Equity Markets**
    *   A "bear market rally" or "dead cat bounce" is currently underway, likely to "peter out" before the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>.
    *   Big falls are expected, with the S&P 500 projected to drop below 3000 in Q1 of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.
    *   From Spring 2023 to mid-to-end 2024, a "last hurrah" is anticipated, featuring parabolic rises to new all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.
    *   This will be followed by a crash, similar to 1929-1932, with equity markets potentially falling by 90% (S&P 500-600 level) as the world enters a depression era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:18:00">[33:18:00]</a>.
*   **Currencies**
    *   **US Dollar** The dollar is expected to "come off its perch" and fall very seriously, halving in value by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:37:00">[31:37:00]</a>. This may coincide with oil producers deciding to no longer sell oil for dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:00">[32:01:00]</a>.
    *   **New Currency** A new currency, being developed by BRICS+, SCO, and EAEU, based on the value of 20 commodities (valued in grams of gold, not dollars), could emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:00">[32:11:00]</a>. This signifies a large part of the world moving away from the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Other Currencies** Big rises are expected in the Euro, Pound Sterling, Ruble, and Chinese Yuan by mid-2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>. The UAE's Dirham is a currency to watch, as it might be de-pegged from the US dollar, likely coinciding with oil sales in other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>.
*   **Commodities**
    *   Hunt does not believe the world is in a commodity super cycle, but rather a normal business cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:00">[35:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Oil** The average oil price is projected to be $107 in 2022, $130 in 2023, and $170 in 2024, driven by inflationary recovery and supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:00">[37:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Base Metals (Copper)** Copper is expected to see a short-term bear market rally to about $8,700 before year-end, then fall to $6,000 in Q1 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>. Subsequently, due to inflation, a falling dollar, consumption recovery, inventory replenishment, and financial institutions seeking hedges, copper prices could peak around $14,000 by the end of 2024, before a complete collapse into depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:18:00">[38:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Gold** Gold is expected to reflect the "real value of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>. With a resurgence of inflation, gold will be bought and held, and a large part of the world will revert to a de facto gold standard, with commodities valued in grams of gold instead of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>. While a specific dollar price is not given, it is expected to be "significantly higher than today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:00">[40:19:00]</a>, especially when priced in other currencies like Yen, Euro, or Pound Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>.

### Climate and Energy Transition
A significant point of concern is the impending shift from a warming cycle to a cooling cycle as early as 2027, with NOAA projecting a "full-blown cold cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This raises questions about the long-term viability and public acceptance of current investments in electric vehicles (EVs) and renewables, especially as the weather naturally cools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This shift is linked to long-term climate cycles (40 to 70 years) driven by sunspot and volcanic activity, and ocean temperature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. The cooling weather allows oceans to absorb excess CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Public rebellion against high electricity prices due to the switch to renewables is anticipated by 2027 or 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:12:00">[36:12:00]</a>.

## [[Challenges and misconceptions in investment strategies | Investment Challenges and Opportunities]]
When asked about [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation | investment strategies]] and capital protection, Hunt clarifies that he is a strategist, not a financial advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:43:00">[44:43:00]</a>. His approach is to continuously monitor data points to determine if his forecasts are "on track" or "off track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:00">[44:54:00]</a>. He maintains his views until the data changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:03:00">[45:03:00]</a>.

## Concerns
Hunt's primary concerns revolve around the dangerous financial state of the world and ongoing warmongering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29:00">[45:29:00]</a>. He expresses apprehension about the "Davos crowd" and their attempts to reshape the world, believing they may have influenced governments but "have not bought the people," who are beginning to rebel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:43:00">[45:43:00]</a>. This theme of an elite attempting to reshape the world against the will of the people is a central puzzle piece for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:25:00">[46:25:00]</a>.

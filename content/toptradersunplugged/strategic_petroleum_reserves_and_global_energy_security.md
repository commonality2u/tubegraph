Strategic petroleum reserves (SPR) are government-held stockpiles of crude oil intended for use in an energy crisis. They were established to safeguard nations against supply disruptions and volatile oil prices, particularly after the oil crises of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.

## Purpose and History
The SPR was developed as an "elegant solution" to address situations where countries, like Saudi Arabia in the 1970s, might [[geopolitical_influences_on_energy_markets | withhold oil from the market]] to "punish the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>. This tactic, referred to as the "oil sword," previously led to significant issues such as gas lines and rationing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:29">[01:37:29]</a>. The reserve's primary function is to enable a country to "weather a storm for quite some time" if its oil supply is cut off by a "bad actor country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:48">[01:38:48]</a>. This strategic capability has historically discouraged the use of oil as a weapon for approximately 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:30">[01:39:30]</a>.

Alongside the SPR, the International Energy Agency (IEA) was formed to provide transparency and data in the energy market, though its recent recommendations against new upstream investments have been criticized as detrimental to global supply security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:46">[01:37:46]</a>.

## Current Status and Depletion
In recent months, there has been an unprecedented rate of release from strategic petroleum reserves, particularly from the U.S. and other OECD countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. The U.S. has been releasing approximately one million barrels per day, while other OECD nations have released 500,000 barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:05">[01:34:05]</a>. China is also believed to hold a strategic reserve, but most other countries operate on a "hand to mouth" basis with no significant crude oil inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:26">[01:34:26]</a>.

The decision to release from the SPR was made following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the intention of capping oil prices and flooding commercial inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>. However, this strategy did not achieve its desired effect, as the released oil was quickly absorbed by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>. Commercial inventories, which normally build by 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of the year, only built by about 200,000 barrels per day, despite the additional 1.5 million barrels per day from the SPR. This indicates a "tight market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:41">[01:35:41]</a>.

The SPR is now estimated to be about two-thirds or 65% depleted from its high-water mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:15">[01:36:15]</a>. Previous administrations, including Obama and Trump, also released from the SPR, and it has historically been difficult to replenish once drawn down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a>. Given the current deficits, the SPR cannot sufficiently offset them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.

## Implications for Global Energy Security
The depletion of the SPR is a significant concern, especially at a time when the world is not "aligned and calm and peaceful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>. This leaves nations "very, very vulnerable" to future [[potential_geopolitical_risks_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical risks]] and disruptions in oil supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. Restoring stability requires directing capital back into the energy sector, which has been neglected for too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

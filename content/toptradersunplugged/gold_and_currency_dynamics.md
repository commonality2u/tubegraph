Karl Sakoff, Chairman and founder of 13D Research and Strategy, highlights significant shifts in [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] and [[US Dollar and Global Currency Movements | currency trends]], suggesting a move away from the current global financial order.

## The Outlook for Gold

Sakoff believes that [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] is poised for a major breakout in price, currently trading just below its all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Chart analysis suggests that gold is "marking time" and "gaining power" before a significant surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This potential breakout is also indicated by current [[Gold investment trends and central bank activities | gold investment trends and central bank activities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>.

### Factors Supporting Gold's Rise:
*   **Supply-Demand Dynamics:** The global [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] supply increases by approximately 1% annually, while the "dollar universe" has seen additions of two trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance:** Over the last 25 years, [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] has seen a 67% increase, compared to the S&P's 288% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Sentiment:** Central bankers view a rising [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] price as a sign that their [[US Dollar and Global Currency Movements | currency]] is not respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   **"De-dollarization":** The confiscation of Russian foreign exchange reserves served as a "wakeup call" for many countries holding U.S. treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This has led to an increase in gold purchases by central banks, such as Singapore's Monetary Authority, signaling a shift towards [[Gold market dynamics | de-dollarization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.
*   **Monetary Regime Change:** [[Gold market dynamics | Gold]] is seen as a barometer for [[Inflation and Currency Devaluation Trends | inflation]] and deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>. Its peak in August 2020, just before significant [[Inflation and Currency Devaluation Trends | inflation]] emerged, suggests it anticipated both the inflation itself and the Federal Reserve's tightening response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:23">[00:48:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.
*   **Under-ownership:** Globally, [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] represents less than 1% of Assets Under Management (AUM), a stark contrast to its 8% peak in 1980, indicating massive under-ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Physical Shortage:** A severe shortage of physical [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] is anticipated, which will become more apparent when the price breaks out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

### Gold Miners as an Opportunity
Sakoff considers [[Gold market dynamics | gold mining]] stocks to be the "cheapest asset on the planet," followed by [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:14">[00:45:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>. Despite [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] rising 11% annually since 2011, miners are down 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:15">[00:46:15]</a>. Costs for miners are now decreasing (14-25%), and their reserve life has declined by 30% over the last decade, making them particularly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. In a significant market move, miners tend to outperform bullion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

### Gold vs. Bitcoin
Sakoff suggests that investors should consider holding both [[Gold market dynamics | gold]] and Bitcoin, viewing them as complementary rather than exclusive alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:04]</a>.

## Evolution of Currency and US Dollar Hegemony

There is widespread frustration among many countries regarding the U.S. dollar's hegemony, with a desire to transition to alternative systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>.

### Functions of Currency in Flux
A currency serves as a unit of account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **Medium of Exchange:** This function is "shifting dramatically," with countries increasingly trading in their own currencies, such as China paying Saudi Arabia for oil in RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   **Reserve Currency Status:** The importance of [[US Dollar and Global Currency Movements | reserve currency]] status is diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>. Central banks are less dependent on holding large foreign exchange reserves due to factors like direct currency trading and swap lines with the People's Bank of China (PBOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. Foreign central banks stopped financing the U.S. government in 2014, indicating a long-standing shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

### Calls for Gold-Backed Currencies
There are discussions about creating gold-backed currencies within the BRICS nations and even a potential ruble that is gold-backed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:36">[00:41:36]</a>.

### Impact on US Debt
The shift away from recycling surpluses into U.S. treasuries, a system devised by Kissinger, suggests that less foreign capital will finance U.S. debt, potentially leading to higher [[Interest rates and currency trends | yields]] over time and a more challenging financing situation for the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. The U.S. Congress, in Sakoff's view, does not fully grasp the finite capacity for accumulating debt, and the U.S. is currently experiencing "fiscal dominance" where the Treasury is largely in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU Stern School of Business, shares his insights on the [[impact_of_ai_on_employment_and_investment | impact of AI on employment and investment]], the economy, and [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | investment strategies]] during a conversation on Top Traders Unplugged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>. He emphasizes the need for investors to adapt their philosophies in a rapidly changing market, particularly with the advent of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## AI's Overall Economic Impact

Damodaran contends that the net effect of AI on the economy will likely be close to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. While AI will undoubtedly create winners, it will do so by "destroying other businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> that currently contribute to GDP, leading to job losses in some sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

He draws parallels to past [[technological_advancements_effect_on_the_economy | technological advancements effect on the economy]] such as personal computers, the internet, and social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Each of these was predicted to accelerate economic growth, yet the actual growth in GDP during the decades of their rise (1980s, 1990s, 2000s) was lower than before their emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. These technologies created significant winners like Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, but their net effect on markets was "surprisingly neutral" due to the numerous businesses that shrunk or disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Damodaran predicts that AI will similarly change the way we work and live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, creating winners, though perhaps not the companies initially expected to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## AI's Impact on Investing

### Market Dynamics and Company Valuation
Damodaran cautions against "lazy arguments" that push up stock prices simply because "AI is going to be big" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. He stresses the importance of asking specific questions about how a company monetizes its position in AI and its ability to withstand competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

He highlights the "big market delusion" where macro stories justify high valuations without specific questions about monetization or competitive threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This leads to pricing companies at unsustainable levels, even if the market story is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. He predicts a "delusion breaks" when numbers fail to meet optimistic stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

Furthermore, he points out that company spending on AI is a cost item for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Therefore, for an AI company to become valuable, other companies' profits will necessarily decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This suggests that AI will be a "pluses for some minuses for others" scenario, not a benefit for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### Specific Company Valuations (Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon)
*   **Nvidia**: Damodaran views Nvidia as an "architecture business" for AI, similar to Cisco during the internet boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. These businesses monetize early by providing critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, architecture businesses typically hit a ceiling and do not represent the majority of the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. While Nvidia has an advantage in being an early monetizer of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, its current valuation, reaching a $3 trillion market cap, implies the AI chip market will be twice the largest estimated size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Nvidia's historical "opportunistic growth" in gaming, crypto, and AI is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, suggesting its potential for finding new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. A key unanswered question for Nvidia is the "stickiness" of its market share against competition from AMD and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Microsoft and Amazon**: Unlike Nvidia, these companies are not priced with the same "perfection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. They are considered "money machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a> rather than solely driven by future expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. These "big tech companies" also hold a significant advantage in the AI space due to their vast amounts of proprietary data and powerful computing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This scenario challenges the traditional "Clayton Christensen hypothesis" that disruption always comes from outsiders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

### Impact on Investment Strategies
Damodaran notes that professional money managers have been struggling for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. He highlights that in recent decades, market increases have been dominated by a few repeat winners (e.g., FAANG stocks accounted for 15% of the increase in market cap of all US stocks between 2010 and 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. This means active investors who did not own these stocks were at a significant disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

He criticizes rigid [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment strategies in a changing economic landscape]] like "old-time value investing" (buying low PE ratios, small caps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, which often exclude these winning companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. These styles are "not dynamic" enough to stretch across the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

The [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | impact of AI and technology on financial markets]] has flattened the investment world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Previously difficult tasks like screening for companies using metrics are now automated and nearly instantaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>, making them less effective as a unique advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

He also criticizes "lazy value investing" that simply bets against momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. He argues that betting against stocks like Tesla or Nvidia based solely on high price-to-earnings ratios, without conducting a proper valuation, has led to significant losses for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. According to Damodaran, every "momentum stock" has been cheap at some point, making it possible for value investors to buy them if they conduct proper valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>.

### Equity Risk Premium and Market Predictions
Damodaran explains the [[investment_strategies_and_market_predictions | equity risk premium]] as the additional return investors demand for investing in risky assets like stocks compared to a risk-free rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. He advocates for a forward-looking equity risk premium, which he calculates monthly by looking at what investors are paying for S&P 500 stocks and the expected cash flows from those investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. This provides a "grounded in reality" measure of expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>.

He notes that in July 2023, the equity risk premium was 4.11%, the lowest since before the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. If this premium is considered too low, it suggests stocks are overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. He distinguishes this from backward-looking historical premiums or blunt instruments like the PE ratio, which do not factor in interest rates, growth, or cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

Regarding [[impact_of_economic_indices_on_portfolios | investing during economic shifts]], Damodaran states that inflation volatility will affect businesses, particularly those without pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>. The shift from historically low inflation (2010-2022) to more normal inflation rates post-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a> caused a significant adjustment in markets, particularly in bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. Companies with strong pricing power, like Amazon and Netflix, were able to "pass inflation through" and insulate their profits, contributing to their comeback in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

## Future of Investing in an AI World
Damodaran advises investors to "read less, think more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>. He believes that the ability to develop one's own original way of thinking is the "biggest potential differential advantage" over AI machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. He warns that if all an investor does is "mechanical stuff," a bot will do it "much better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. This self-reflection and independent thought are crucial for thriving in an investing world increasingly impacted by AI.

[[diversification_in_trend_following | Diversification]] is considered a fundamental aspect of successful [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following strategies]], aiming for superior performance and consistency over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is highlighted as a core principle for long-term survival in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Core Principles of Diversification

Jerry Parker, founder of Chesapeake Capital, emphasizes that "massive [[diversification_in_trend_following | diversification]]" was a significant key principle taught early in his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. This approach contributes to a strategy's ability to maintain performance even when other managers and famous hedge funds experience "horrible periods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Evolution of Market Diversification

Over the years, Chesapeake Capital has continuously expanded its range of traded markets to enhance diversification. This expansion includes:
*   **Equities and Single Stocks** The firm has moved from focusing on single stock futures markets to trading single stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Today, equities comprise half of their portfolio, encompassing around 150 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   **Commodities and Currencies** Actively trading "as many commodities as we can," along with "so many currencies and cross currencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates** Including various interest rate futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>, such as a newly added three-year U.S. Futures note market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Broader Securities Markets** Venturing into ETFs, mortgage-backed securities, TIPS, corporate bonds, and muni bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

This constant search for new markets is driven by the belief that securities and stock markets offer ample opportunities for interesting additions to a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

## Diversification of Systems and Parameters

Beyond market diversification, Chesapeake Capital also employs [[diversification_in_trend_following | diversification]] in its internal trading systems and parameters. After experiencing poor performance in the late 1990s, the firm shifted to very long-term look-backs, now hundreds of days, compared to their initial 20-day look-back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This change was prompted by observing "amazing" one-to-three-year moves on weekly charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

The firm decided to implement a range of systems, from shorter to longer-term, trading "a bunch of things in between" in increments to achieve system diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. Historically, all chosen parameters for their one-entry, one-exit, one-stop-loss breakout method have made similar amounts of money over long test periods, meaning the specific choice of parameters didn't significantly alter overall returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. This supports the strategy of using a wide range of parameters for diversification.

The philosophy of using "all the data" for backtesting means that parameter changes are not frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. While minor adjustments to parameters might occur on the "edges" (e.g., if a system becomes too short-term or too long-term) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>, the core belief is that a simple, diversified approach leads to consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

## Benefits of Diversification

*   **Consistency:** A diversified portfolio of simple, classic [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following]] systems, even with open profit drawdowns, has historically shown more consistency on an annual basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. This consistency is preferred over chasing high Sharpe ratios, which might compromise the core principle of letting profits run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Crisis Alpha:** Trend following, particularly with extensive diversification and robust [[risk_management_in_trend_following | stop-loss]] strategies, acts as a "crisis Alpha" provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. This was notably evident in 2022 when traditional 60/40 stock and bond portfolios struggled, while trend following continued to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
*   **Reduced Drawdowns:** Compared to traditional long-only equity investments that can experience severe drawdowns (e.g., 50% or 90% in NASDAQ), a trend-following approach with diversification and [[risk_management_in_trend_following | stop losses]] aims to achieve similar or better returns with significantly reduced drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:39">[00:52:39]</a>.

The speaker believes that a fully diversified [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following]] portfolio, encompassing numerous markets and a healthy dose of equities, provides sufficient robustness without needing additional strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:24">[01:06:24]</a>. The belief is that it is too risky to include strategies in a portfolio that do not incorporate a trailing stop and a stop loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>.

## Challenges and Skepticism

Despite the benefits, maintaining this highly diversified and pure trend-following approach can be challenging, particularly when external pressures arise to "smooth" returns or deviate from core rules. Experimenting with smoothing techniques, profit objectives, dynamic position sizing, and correlation management were past "mistakes" that led to unexpected performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The firm reverted to a "classic one entry, one exit, and a stop loss type trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

A core philosophy is to be skeptical of anything that promises to make trading "smoother" or "better" without rigorous proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. The speaker argues against focusing on Sharpe ratio for [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following]], as it unfairly penalizes strategies with non-normal distributions and positive skew, and may prevent the key element of letting profits run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>.

There is also a tension between adhering to a strict philosophy and satisfying investor preferences for smoother returns or higher Sharpe ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. The speaker believes it's essential to educate clients on what they "need" (consistency) versus what they "want" (comfort and ease) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The speaker is optimistic that the period of 2020-2022 marks the beginning of a return to a "normal situation" where [[diversification_in_trend_following | diversification]] in [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following strategies]] will once again prove superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:32">[01:07:32]</a>. This is based on the conviction that people underestimate the inherent dangers and "crazy things" that can happen in the world, for which [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following]] remains one of the best solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>. The long-term goal is to see [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following]] elevated to its proper position within the investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

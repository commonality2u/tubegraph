This article explores current [[global_macroeconomic_cycles_and_their_influence_on_financial_markets | global macroeconomic cycles]] and their historical parallels, particularly focusing on [[Longterm Debt Cycles and Economic History | long-term debt cycles]], inflation, and their implications for investors. The discussion features insights from Lyn Alden of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.

## Current Global Macro Picture

The current global economic situation is characterized by reaching the high point of two very [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | long-term cycles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:
1.  **The US Long-Term Debt Cycle**: This cycle spans 50 to 100 years and involves credit building up and deleveraging, but never fully returning to its starting point due to declining interest rates over four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
2.  **The Dollar-Centric Global Monetary Framework**: The world has largely outgrown this system, yet remains constrained by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The US has run large trade deficits and exported supply chains to maintain the dollar's global reserve status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This has led to a negative net international investment position and decreased manufacturing ability, especially as [[global_macroeconomic_cycles_and_their_influence_on_financial_markets | globalization]] seems to be pulling back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The last time these cycles reached a similar high water mark was in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_current_economic_conditions_to_past_economic_cycles | Historical Comparison: 1920s-1940s vs. 2010s-2020s]]

While history doesn't repeat, it often "rhymes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. There are many similarities between the two periods, although not identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### The 1920s & 1930s
*   **Credit Buildup**: The 1920s saw a massive accumulation of credit over several decades, culminating in the 1929 market crash and the start of the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **[[private_debt_and_financial_stability | Private Debt]]**: [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | Private debt]] as a percentage of GDP reached all-time highs, while federal debt remained low due to a leaner government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Deleveraging & Deflation**: The 1930s experienced a huge deleveraging event, with many bank failures and a one-third reduction in the broad money supply, leading to a significant deflationary shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Official deflation levels reached 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Policy Response**:
    *   Currency devaluation: The dollar was de-pegged from 1/20th of an ounce of gold to 1/35th of an ounce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Money printing and infrastructure programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   Increased federal debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | Private debt]] was reduced primarily in real terms through dollar devaluation rather than nominal deleveraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The 1930s were characterized by a deflationary shock followed by a reflationary response, not high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### The 1940s
*   **Shift to Federal Debt**: By the 1940s, the [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | private debt]] bubble was mostly worked off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **World War II Deficits**: The US entered World War II, leading to massive federal deficits (20-30% of GDP) and a huge fiscal spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Federal debt rose to over 100% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Inflationary Environment**: This period was inflationary due to supply shortages and massive deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Federal Reserve Action**: The Federal Reserve partnered with the Treasury to fund deficits through "quantitative easing" (QE) and formal yield curve control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. They bought treasuries to keep yields at 2.5% or less throughout the decade, even as inflation sometimes went into double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Debt Reduction by Inflation**: Treasury investors made nominal gains but lost purchasing power in real terms, as yields failed to keep up with CPI [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This "inflated away" a significant portion of federal debt as a percentage of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### The 2010s & 2020s
*   **Great Financial Crisis (GFC)**: Similar to 1929, the GFC involved a massive, decades-long buildup of [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | private sector debt]], reaching levels even higher than in 1929 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Deleveraging & Sovereign Debt**: A huge deleveraging event occurred, with some banks failing and a lot of [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | private debt]] moving to the federal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Federal debt to GDP rose from ~65% pre-crisis to over 100% post-crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Disinflationary Environment**: For several years post-GFC, despite QE, the environment was disinflationary because QE primarily recapitalized banks and was offset by consumer deleveraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Current Crisis (COVID-19)**: Corporate debt built up again, and federal debt was already at 106% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The COVID-19 economic shutdown has led to deficits (20-30%) as large as those seen in World War II, expected to continue for several years due to joblessness and ongoing stimulus needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This period mimics the 1940s, dealing with sovereign debt bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Key Differences and Similarities
*   **Demographics**: The current situation has a slower-growing, more aged population, making higher [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]] harder to achieve compared to the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Nature of Conflict**: There is no "hot war" currently, but rather a "cold war" with economic decoupling, particularly between the US and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic and government shutdowns represent the biggest economic shock and deficits since World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   **Debt Structure**: In the 1930s/40s, there was a [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | private debt]] bubble followed by a federal debt bubble, worked off a decade apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Today, there's high federal debt alongside significant corporate debt (post-GFC partial deleveraging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Overall public and [[private_debt_and_financial_stability | private debt]] combined is very high (around 350% of GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Policy Response Speed**: After 1929, it took about 10 years for the Fed to implement something akin to QE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. This time, QE was deployed relatively quickly after 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Supply Chains**: Like World War II, which had supply shortages due to war material usage, the current period faces supply shortages due to globally diversified supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Reshoring supply chains for resilience, though higher cost, could be inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. This could reverse the disinflationary effect of offshoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

## [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | Inflation Outlook]]

The base case is for higher [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]] in the 2020s compared to the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

*   **QE Impact**: In the 2010s, QE mostly recapitalized banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Currently, due to large fiscal deficits (e.g., stimulus checks, unemployment benefits, potential infrastructure spending), QE is being injected more directly into the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Money Supply Growth**: The US broad money supply increased by about 7% per year on average over the past decade, with a massive 25% increase in just six months recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. This high monetary base inflation hasn't fully translated to prices due to technology and offshoring previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **Fed's Stance**: The Fed's target is 2% [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]], but they are fine with "symmetric" [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]], meaning they can go above 2% for several years (e.g., 3%) to compensate for past undershoots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. This could translate to 4-6% actual inflation for goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.
*   **Risk of Uncontrolled Inflation**: While central banks aim for gradual inflation, it could quickly get out of control if global investors lose confidence in currencies and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. The bond market is larger than the Fed, and if "bond vigilantes" unite, the Fed's control could be challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

The expectation is for significant currency devaluation by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. This could manifest as a large devaluation versus commodities and hard assets, or as a more 1970s-style environment with high everyday [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

## Debt Resolution and [[Implications of Federal Debt and Sovereign Debt Crises | Sovereign Debt Crises]]

Historically, "debt jubilees" have been common, often taking the form of currency devaluation rather than outright forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

*   Yield curve control and de-pegging currencies from gold (like the dollar's shift from 1/20th to ~1/1800th of an ounce of gold) are examples of "mini debt jubilees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.
*   During the 1940s and 1970s, holding treasuries effectively provided the US government with a partial debt jubilee, as investors lost about a third of their purchasing power over a decade due to yields underperforming [[secular_vs_cyclical_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>.
*   The main thing to watch for is currency devaluation, though outright debt forgiveness cannot be totally ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

## [[Longterm trends and profitability | Investment Implications]]

In this environment, certain asset classes are expected to perform well:

*   **Precious Metals and Commodities**: A bullish outlook on gold (expected to exceed $3,000 by decade-end) and silver, as well as a broad basket of commodities and high-quality commodity producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. This is because scarce assets generally do well in inflationary environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
    *   This includes copper, silver, nickel, and battery metals, especially given the shift towards renewable energy and electric vehicles which require more of these materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. Lack of exploration in commodities suggests future supply shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
    *   Gold's performance is inversely correlated to real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:21">[00:50:21]</a>. In low or negative real yield environments (like the 2020s are expected to be), gold is likely to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: More hit or miss, with suburban real estate potentially a decent hedge if bought with low, fixed-rate mortgages, contrasting with expensive city real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin (Scarce Digital Assets)**: A more volatile, speculative asset, but with a bullish outlook since April 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.
    *   Bitcoin's market share has strengthened against altcoins and hard forks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.
    *   Platforms like Robinhood, Square, and PayPal now include Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.
    *   It's seen as a digital speculative store of value due to its well-designed, decentralized, and inherently scarce protocol (21 million coin limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
    *   Unlike central bank digital currencies, which would not be scarce, Bitcoin's uniqueness lies in its decentralization and fixed supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>.
    *   While government bans are a tail risk, Bitcoin's encrypted and decentralized nature makes it resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.
    *   A small allocation (e.g., 1%) to Bitcoin is suggested due to its undefined upside and defined downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

[!NOTE|Investment Strategy]
A trend-following approach can work particularly well with commodities due to their boom-bust cycles, mitigating risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a>. While a small permanent allocation to physical precious metals is viable, active decisions should consider intermediate signals like real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

## [[global_macroeconomic_cycles_and_their_influence_on_financial_markets | Unseen Risks & Institutional Challenges]]

*   **Treasury Returns**: A significant risk is that treasuries may provide a negative real return over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:29">[00:55:29]</a>, which is not widely anticipated by average investors or many pension systems.
*   **Commodity Scarcity**: Significant risks of supply shortages in certain metals (e.g., copper) by the end of the decade due to weak exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. Military action could also disrupt oil supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>.
*   **Pension System Challenges**: Many pensions are regulatory stuck holding bonds despite negative real yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>. Some are leveraging up to meet unrealistic return targets (e.g., 7%), which is a risky strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This could lead to pension failures or government bailouts, which would further exacerbate currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:35">[00:59:35]</a>.
*   **Investor Mindset**: Most institutional and retail investors are still not heavily allocated to precious metals or Bitcoin; interest remains relatively niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>.

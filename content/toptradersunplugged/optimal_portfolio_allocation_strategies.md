Niels Kaastrup-Larsen and Rob Carver explore various aspects of [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investing]] and [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation | investment strategy]], taking the pulse of global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This article synthesizes their discussion on [[asset_allocation_decisionmaking | asset allocation]] and related [[investing_strategies_and_risk_management | investing strategies and risk management]].

## Market Overview and Current Trends
As of November 2022, markets have been highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The ultimate level of interest rates is expected to be higher and for longer than previously anticipated, with futures markets indicating fed funds staying above 5% for all of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. This is a significant shift from September's expectations of rates turning lower before reaching 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

Despite the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening, the economy has shown resilience, with 233,000 jobs added and rising hourly earnings, surpassing expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. U.S. technology stocks have seen the most significant losses over the last seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

Trend following strategies have generally performed well year-to-date in 2022, primarily from gains in energies and shorting bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. Rob Carver's portfolio is up about 26% year-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>, with current major bets in bonds (short) and energies (long) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Systematic Trading Strategy Considerations

### Short-Term Momentum Trading
The profitability of trend following tends to break down for holding periods shorter than about a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Shorter time frames, such as a few days or hours, often see mean reversion performing better, though executing such strategies requires extremely hot execution and careful management of transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. For example, a mean reversion system with a holding period of a few days requires using limit orders to manage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

Capturing short-term momentum (e.g., a few hours or single-day holding periods) is difficult due to prohibitive transaction costs, even in relatively cheap asset classes like futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Only a dozen or so futures are liquid enough for this kind of strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Rob Carver advises against it for most investors due to the high demands on execution and backtesting confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

Longer look-back periods tend to correlate with more consistent performance in trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. For instance, a 200-day look-back period (approximately one year) has shown to be optimal in many historical observations, with most time periods remaining profitable even if not perfectly optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

### Optimal Allocation for Lower Volatility Funds (UCITS)
For UCITS funds in the UK, target volatility is often capped, usually around 10-15% annualized volatility, due to regulatory limits on Value at Risk (VaR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>. Mathematically, if a fund runs at a lower volatility (e.g., 12.5% instead of 25%), investors should increase their allocation proportionally (e.g., from 25% to 50%) to achieve a similar risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

> "Mathematically, if you're you have a low volatility then you should allocate more to it that's just basic portfolio optimization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>

Regulations, while aiming for investor safety, can inadvertently limit leverage and diversification, such as by restricting commodity exposure in some UCITS funds, which are often key diversifiers in CTA portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.

### Asset Classes vs. Trading Strategies
Portfolio design involves two distinct steps:
1.  **Deciding asset class percentages**: For example, stocks, real estate, bonds, currencies, and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.
2.  **Deciding trading strategies**: Such as trend following, mean reversion, or indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

Comparing a single-asset class index strategy (like a traditional 60/40 portfolio) with a diversified multi-asset class trend-following strategy changes two variables simultaneously, which can be confusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. Ideally, portfolio optimization would allocate to all asset class/strategy combinations simultaneously, but in practice, a hierarchical approach (e.g., defining asset classes then strategies) works well and simplifies explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>.

Adding a diversified trend-following strategy to a traditional stock/bond portfolio is seen as a key step in enhancing diversification and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>.

### Mean Reversion Systems and Cross-Sectional Signals
Mean reversion can be applied globally across macro sectors like bonds, stocks, currencies, and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. This involves looking at an instrument's performance relative to its overall sector (e.g., US 10-year relative to the bond complex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. However, such cross-sectional effects are typically less profitable than broader asset-class level trends, as approximately 75% of trend following performance comes from asset class-level trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.

### Trading Costs and Contract Sizes
Transaction costs, including rolling costs for futures, are crucial and should be factored into performance calculations (e.g., Sharpe Ratio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>. Holding costs become a larger proportion of overall trading costs for slower trend following systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:24">[00:42:24]</a>. While micro/mini contracts can be used, some are not liquid enough for efficient trading, making larger contracts preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

### Cash Equities/ETFs vs. Futures for Trend Following
Trading ETFs for trend following involves several considerations:
*   **Liquidity**: Many commodity/FX ETFs have low liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:55">[00:44:55]</a>.
*   **Holding Costs**: ETFs can be more expensive due to expense ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>.
*   **Leverage Issues**: Leveraged ETFs can have specific complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.
*   **Hedging and Proxying**: Commodity ETFs may have issues with how they hedge their exposure and proxy futures contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

Learning to trade futures is generally recommended for those with sufficient capital and experience, as they offer more diversification opportunities and are often cheaper to trade than ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a>. Futures are leveraged derivatives and carry higher risk, necessitating a good understanding of the instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

### Hedge Fund Replication
Hedge fund replication attempts to mimic fund returns using statistical methods, often regressions of recent returns against a basket of instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Challenges include:
*   **Lag**: Positions constantly change, and regressions suffer from information lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **Look-back Window**: A short window creates a noisy regression; a long window struggles to adapt to changing fund returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:32">[00:49:32]</a>.
*   **Market Coverage**: Replication often requires a small, consistent number of markets, unlike actual funds that trade hundreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

An alternative approach is to build a diversified [[systematic_investment_strategies | systematic investment strategy]] based on a range of assets and strategies, then optimize that portfolio to match a target index or fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. While hedge fund replication products can be a good niche for smaller investors due to lower fees and accessibility, they are not typically a replacement for a full-fledged, diversified fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:48">[00:59:48]</a>.

### Quantifying Optimal Allocation to Trend Following
To determine the optimal allocation to trend following within a portfolio, considering a simple 60/40 equities/bonds portfolio alongside a trend-following strategy, an adjustment for secular trends is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Historically, 60/40 portfolios have benefited from falling inflation and interest rates, leading to re-rating effects in equities and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>. Removing these secular trends reveals that the average return of 60/40 is flattered by historical market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.

When accounting for these secular trends and the inherent uncertainties in portfolio optimization, analyses suggest that the allocation to trend following should be substantially higher than 60/40, possibly more than 55% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. This indicates that if the secular trends of the past 40 years do not continue, allocating more to trend following is intuitively expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. One study using the SocGen Trend Index found an optimal allocation of 64% to the trend index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.

[[Trend following]] is a trading strategy that aims to profit from the persistent movement of market prices in a particular direction. It is considered one of the most successful and repeatable investment methods, often compared favorably to value stock investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Core Principles

A successful trading strategy, particularly [[Trend following]], relies on several key principles:
*   **Non-random Entry and Exit** A systematic and non-random method for entering and exiting markets is fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.
*   **Discipline and Self-Control** Traders must possess significant discipline and self-control to set aside personal opinions and methodically apply their chosen method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This is seen as a major advantage of systematic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Risk Management** Proper position sizing and risk management are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Mis-sizing positions can turn a positive expected outcome into a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. The ideal risk level is optimal, and exceeding it can lead to worse returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Understanding Drawdowns** Drawdowns are an inherent part of investment strategies, and a longer trading period will inevitably lead to larger drawdowns than previously experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. The expectation that one will never lose more than a certain percentage in a year is unrealistic for [[Trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Historical Context and Evidence

[[Trend following]] has a long history, with discussions about its demise dating back decades, such as a "Futures Magazine from 1991 declaring [[trend_following_dead | Trend following dead]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Despite these recurring declarations, the strategy has been replicated time and again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Studies, like one by AQR, suggest that [[Trend following]] would have worked for hundreds of years, with anecdotal evidence from historical events like the Civil War cotton market or the South Sea Bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

The effectiveness of [[Trend following]] stems from the "fat tail distribution of price moves," where large outlier price movements occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This phenomenon is academically verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms

Despite its historical success, [[Trend following]] faces continuous skepticism and challenges:
*   **"Trend Following is Dead" Narrative** This argument frequently resurfaces, especially during periods of underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. While veterans dismiss it, some managers have indeed experienced significant drawdowns or folded in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Volatility Compression** Certain market environments, particularly volatility compression, are not ideal for [[Trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If there are no big trends (i.e., price range compression), [[Trend following]] will not perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. However, volatility increasing *after* trade entry, as a trend grows, is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Human Nature** "Homo sapiens" are "not particularly hardwired very well for trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, making it difficult for investors to maintain a long-term horizon and tolerate drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Unfair Standards** [[Trend following]] is often "held to a standard if the stock market got held to that standard the S&P wouldn't exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Fund managers like Covenant Capital, even with significant drawdowns, are questioned on whether their method still works, despite being within expected statistical variance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Weaknesses in Strategy
[[Trend following]] models can be weak during:
*   The end of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   Sideways markets that constantly generate new signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.
*   Downward trending markets with short upward spikes that illicit signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:21">[00:36:21]</a>.

## Application and Risk Management

Covenant Capital Management, co-founded by Scott Billington, is a firm that adheres to a [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following trading strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. They have maintained their trading philosophy even through significant losses, such as a 20% drawdown in their second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Position Sizing
Position sizing is critical for their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Covenant Capital utilizes a fixed fraction of the account size to determine risk for each position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. They are aware of the optimal risk level, noting that risk-to-return is not a linear function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

### Risk Control
The firm defines risk in a straightforward manner: the distance from the market price to the predefined stop-loss point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. They manage risk through:
*   **Stop-Losses** Every position has a point at which they exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
*   **Maximum Limits** There are maximum limits set at both individual position and portfolio levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. If these maximums are hit, position sizes are reduced to fit back within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.
*   **Correlation Assumption** For [[Trend following]], markets tend to correlate higher when they are "in a position that matters," i.e., when risk is building in winning trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. They assume all sectors are highly correlated when managing overall portfolio risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.
*   **Controlling Drawdowns** Drawdowns are controlled by ensuring that the amount of money at risk from an equity high never exceeds a preset level of the account's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.
*   **Risk Level** Covenant Capital offers different programs with varying maximum risk levels, from 25% for the original program to 95% for the "optimal" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This means if a client were to invest in the optimal program, they could lose 95% of their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.

### Managing Large Moves
The "handling of the large moves is sort of all that matters" in [[Trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. While a losing trade might represent one unit of risk, a winning trade can yield 40 units or more, equivalent to many losing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. Therefore, managing huge winners is highly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.

## Investor Perception and Due Diligence

Investors often struggle to differentiate between [[Trend following]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Scott Billington suggests investors should ask more qualitative questions focusing on robustness and repeatability, rather than just operational due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>. Key questions include:
*   "How many parameters do you use in your method?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>
*   "If you changed your parameters by 5% what kind of effect does that have on your returns?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>
*   "Why did you pick the number that you picked?" (e.g., if using a 50-day window, why 50?) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>
*   "What are your luckiest periods?" and "What were your least lucky periods?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>
*   "How do you handle costs?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>

Scott Billington also recommends that investors should have people with actual trading experience conduct due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Personal Habits and Mindset for Trend Following

Scott Billington believes that successful trading is not "mystical" but rather "simple but difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. Key personal aspects for [[Trend following]] include:
*   **Analytical Mind** Traders need an analytical mind and to be good with probabilistic thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Loss** The ability to admit when one is wrong and get out of losing trades is crucial, especially given a typically low win ratio (e.g., 30% for Covenant Capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Physical and Mental Health** Maintaining good health, eating properly, and exercising are advisable due to the stressful nature of the profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. Avoiding substance abuse is particularly important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.
*   **Removing Emotion** Creating a systematic approach and even delegating trade execution (as Covenant Capital does) helps remove personal emotions from decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

Hedge funds and CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategies often position themselves as standalone investments. However, Roy Neerhofer of RG Neerhofer Capital Management advocates for a unique approach: viewing these strategies as complementary components designed to enhance an existing portfolio of traditional investments like stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:50">[04:28:50]</a>. This perspective shifts the focus from a strategy's individual performance metrics to its contribution to overall [[Diversification and portfolio management | portfolio diversification]] and risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.

## Roy Neerhofer's Approach to Portfolio Improvement

Neerhofer Capital Management's core strategy is intentionally designed to provide consistent downside protection for portfolios, particularly during times of equity market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Maximizing Client Benefit
Rather than maximizing its own Sharpe ratio or risk-adjusted return, the firm's strategy is "tuned" to maximize the risk-adjusted return of its clients' portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This aligns with the philosophy that managers should be compensated based on "alpha" (excess return beyond market movements) rather than "beta" (market exposure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

### Consistent Negative Correlation
The firm aims to maintain a consistent negative [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]] to equities, meaning it tends to perform better when equities are struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This focus on providing true protective returns distinguishes it from many other strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. Their best years have historically coincided with significant market sell-offs, such as 2008, 2000-2002, 1998, 1994, 1997, 2011, and market corrections in January and October 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

The mathematical benefit of this strategy is that combining a negatively correlated asset with equities can result in a combined return that is higher than either individual asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This is because reducing the drawdown of the overall portfolio allows it to start the next positive market cycle from a much higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## Correlation Trends in the Hedge Fund and CTA Industries

### Hedge Fund Industry Correlation
The hedge fund industry, in general, has shown a significant correlation to equities. For example, in October 2014, the hedge fund industry was correlated to the stock market at over 0.86 (weekly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This high correlation means that many hedge funds are essentially "long Equity," even if they are described as "long short Equity," making it difficult to justify their fees based on beta exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### CTA Industry Correlation and Protective Role
Historically, CTAs, particularly [[Diversification in trend following | trend following]] strategies, have been seen as a protective element in portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. This protective quality, observed during events like the Long-Term Capital Management demise, 9/11, and the 2008 equity sell-off, largely stemmed from being long fixed income during a secular decline in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

However, Neerhofer argues that this protective role may be at risk in a rising interest rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Roll Yield Problem:** The "roll yield" (or carry) from a positively sloping yield curve has contributed significantly (up to two-thirds) to the profits of long fixed income positions for CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. If interest rates rise, being short fixed income incurs a negative roll yield, which can counteract the price decline of the contract, making it difficult to [[Diversification in trend following | trend follow]] effectively on the short side in fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.
*   **Market Size Limitations:** Other markets, such as commodities, are significantly smaller than financial futures markets, potentially limiting their ability to support large CTA profits even if trends emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Increasing Equity Correlation:** Larger CTA managers may be pushed towards long equity positions to support industry growth, leading to an increased [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]] of the CTA index to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This shift suggests that the protective nature of CTAs may diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **FX Market as a Driver:** The FX (foreign exchange) markets are identified as a potential primary driver of returns for CTAs in a rising rate environment due to their liquidity, volatility, and diversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

### Short-Term CTA Strategies
Roy Neerhofer's firm specializes in short-term strategies, which differ from traditional [[Diversification in trend following | trend following]] in that they have a much greater relationship to realized volatility than to trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. The ideal environment for a short-term manager might be a market that is flat over the year but experiences significant daily movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

A key differentiator for short-term CTA strategies is their exceptionally low inter-manager [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]], often around 0.1 or 0.2 on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This contrasts with long-term CTAs (0.57 or more) and event-driven strategies, which can all be exposed to the same risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

The end of Quantitative Easing (QE) in the US has led to a significant increase in realized volatility across all markets, creating a more favorable environment for strategies that benefit from volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. This rise in volatility can disrupt portfolios previously tuned for a short-volatility, declining-volatility environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Construction and Manager Selection

### Focusing on Portfolio Improvement
Instead of selecting managers based solely on their standalone performance (an "All-Star team" approach), investors should consider how a manager improves the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. The ability to protect a portfolio during significant market declines, particularly on the few "worst days" where most of the damage occurs, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

### Beyond Past Performance
Past performance, particularly short-term metrics like the last two years of Sharpe ratio, is deemed "completely unpredictive" of future performance in CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Investors should instead focus on other factors when evaluating managers:
*   **[[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | Correlation]]**: Is the manager consistently delivering the desired [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]] characteristics? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Performance in Shock Events**: How does the manager perform during significant market downturns or volatile periods? Do they tend to capture trend or rises in realized volatility? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Underlying Factors and Process**: Understand the fundamental factors driving the program, the consistency of the firm's mission, their longevity, and the robustness of their process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Neerhofer Capital Management's Diversification Programs

RG Neerhofer Capital Management offers several programs, each designed to achieve specific [[Hedging strategies and portfolio diversification | diversification]] and [[Portfolio diversification and construction | portfolio diversification]] goals for clients:

*   **Diversified Program:** The flagship product, aiming for a consistent negative [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]] of -0.3 to -0.4 to equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. This program has remained consistent with its initial mandate from 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

*   **Optimal Alpha Program:** Created to have approximately zero [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]] to equity markets, offering a "risk-on" profile relative to the Diversified Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Both Diversified and Optimal Alpha programs produce a similar amount of alpha, but their performance can differ significantly due to their correlation targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

*   **IHedge:** A program designed to address inflation concerns by emphasizing buying commodities and selling fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Short-term managers are less susceptible to the negative carry costs of being short fixed income, allowing this strategy to take short positions when mandated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

*   **Custom Correlation (SMA):** The firm offers Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs) where clients can request a specific, targeted [[Correlation and diversification in investment portfolios | correlation]] to their existing strategy. This allows for a customized hedge, with correlations ranging from a highly negative -0.6 or -0.7 to a positive +0.3 (representing a 50/50 mix with equities, which has historically shown tremendous performance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Clients can also switch between these funds within the firm's complex without losing their high-water mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

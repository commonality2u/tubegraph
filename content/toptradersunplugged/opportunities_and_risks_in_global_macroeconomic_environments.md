In the current [[global_macroeconomic_trends | global macroeconomic trends]] landscape, understanding and navigating the [[risks and opportunities in financial markets | risks and opportunities in financial markets]] is paramount. Experts emphasize shifting investment strategies to build resilience against extreme market movements rather than focusing on expected outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: Preparing for Extremes

A key premise for constructing an investment portfolio is to base it on what is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The goal is to ensure the portfolio performs optimally in extreme conditions, rather than relying on average expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This approach prioritizes constructing resilience for the unknown over predicting what is thought to be known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>.

This philosophy can be illustrated with a football pitch analogy:
*   The ball spins 96% of the time in the middle of the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   Only the 2% extremes, in the two penalty boxes, truly matter for outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   Similarly, in financial markets, the "two percentile tails" – the best and worst months – drive the majority of long-term compounded returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. What happens outside two standard deviations is what drives return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

The focus should be on "magnitude, not frequency" of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. Asymmetry is possible in events that exist outside expectations or imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.

## Critiquing the 60/40 Portfolio Model

The traditional 60/40 optimized portfolio model is considered fundamentally flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The 40% bond allocation was seen as holding capital away from market participation, and eventually, failed to provide sufficient protection to portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

The perceived negative correlation between bonds and stocks, on which the 60/40 model was premised, was artificially generated. This correlation emerged from the "Greenspan put era" onwards, where central banks would cut interest rates when asset prices fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This created a multi-decade benefit of holding both assets together, reducing capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

However, once interest rates reached zero, or even negative levels, the bonds ceased to be risk-mitigating and instead became risk-additive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Quantitative Easing (QE) further exacerbated this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. For example, in Denmark, a major pension fund experienced a 47% loss in its strategic reserve capital in nine months in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This phenomenon is attributed to "Sharp World," a term encompassing traditional financial mathematics like random walk theory, Gaussian normal distribution, efficient market hypothesis, and modern portfolio theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This framework, through its risk regulatory accounting and reporting structures, has effectively "duped" savers via pension funds, insurance companies, and banks into holding government debt, enabling governments to exceed 100% debt-to-GDP levels globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Fragility in Financial Systems

Fragility in the financial system is defined by uncapitalized tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **2008 Financial Crisis**: The banking system's flaws in Basel I regulatory structures allowed infinite leveraging of subprime CDOs, making them appear as AAA assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. A small change in house price correlation wiped out global banking capital, revealing the massive uncapitalized tail risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   **Current Fragility**: The uncapitalized risk now lies in the lack of capital supporting the "40" (bond) portion of portfolios, such as Liability-Driven Investment (LDI) and risk parity strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This deemed the bond allocation risk-reducing, which ironically reduced the capital held against the equity portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Central banks, especially outside the US, are in a precarious position. They are trying to walk a tightrope: raising rates enough to curtail inflation and restore price stability, but not so much that they blow up the leverage in fixed income fiduciary savings pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This delicate balance, coupled with their asymmetric approach to policy changes (slow to raise rates, fast to cut), has led them to fall behind in addressing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Liquidity and Volatility Dynamics

Liquidity and volatility are closely related, often described as "cousins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. A decrease in liquidity, particularly in top-of-book liquidity in futures and market depth in options, has been observed dramatically in 2022 as the Fed raised rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

The focus is on finding areas where uncapitalized tails exist, leading to a high demand for liquidity during market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Volatility**: This has been a key area of market pain. Many market participants, such as Taiwanese insurance companies or German pension funds, sold interest rate volatility, often unknowingly, through callable note structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. When rates moved, these complex products (e.g., 20-year two-year calls) caused significant pain for dealers trying to hedge due to Vanna and Volga problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. This creates hidden losses in the system, similar to mortgage securities in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.
*   **Reflexive Effects**: In the short term, dealer positioning and implied volatility supply can lead to periods of volatility compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. However, this often leads to over-leverage and ultimately, a larger "fat tail" spike when conditions reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

## Convexity as a Defense Mechanism

The concept of "convexity" is crucial. It means structuring an investment to benefit disproportionately from extreme moves, acting as "brakes" in a race car to enable faster driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. This defensive positioning, like a goalkeeper in football, aims to enhance compounding through multiple periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>.

The goal is not to time the market or predict outcomes, but to understand value and potential asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. This involves being a "garbage collector of volatility," seeking out situations where volatility is priced as if an event "can't happen" but someone is willing to sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. The objective is to constantly extend duration and convexity to grow goalkeeping capacity, especially just before it is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.

## Current Opportunities: Where Volatility is Cheap

Opportunities arise where "whales" (large entities, often central banks) are actively suppressing volatility and providing liquidity to the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>.

*   **Japan**: The Japanese structured product market is the oldest and largest, marked by decades of near-zero interest rates and suppressed volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>. The Bank of Japan maintains an interest rate peg on 10-year JGBs at 25 basis points and owns over 100% of some bond issues, despite the swap market pulling away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. This active volatility suppression creates opportunities for those seeking convexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.
*   **China**: China's central bank is actively suppressing volatility in its currency and interest rates, effectively undertaking "quasi-informal QE" by incentivizing state-related institutions to buy bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Europe**: Despite significant market moves, Europe still presents opportunities due to the ongoing provision of QE by the ECB, which is not shrinking its balance sheet and is providing liquidity via instruments like TPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. Many European pension funds continue to hold massively leveraged positions in LDI strategies, creating dynamics where they become forced sellers when yields rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>.
*   **FX and Credit**: These markets also offer interesting opportunities, especially in regions with central bank volatility suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>.
*   **Equity Volatility**: This area is generally less attractive for "cheap" volatility compared to other asset classes, though some specific markets or skew properties might become interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.

## Outrageous Predictions for the Future

Given the current [[global economic and geopolitical risks | global economic and geopolitical risks]] and [[geopolitical challenges and global macroeconomic trends | geopolitical challenges and global macroeconomic trends]], some "outrageous" predictions include:
*   **Capital Controls**: An increasing norm of capital controls and enforced recycling of domestic savings into sovereign bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. This would force pension funds and banks to hold domestic sovereign bonds, similar to rationing of critical resources like energy and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>. This is seen as an inevitability to prevent a nation's savings from funding other countries' debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:33">[01:14:33]</a>.
*   **Rising 10-Year Treasury Yields**: The 10-year Treasury yield could rise above 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:12">[01:16:12]</a>. While yields might flatline or go lower initially, similar to the late 1960s, the Fed is "stuck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:28">[01:16:28]</a>. As recessions deepen and long-term inflation expectations rise, this could accelerate, leading to counter-intuitive steepener trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.
*   **Price Controls**: Politicians may implement price controls to combat inflation, which are essentially hidden fiscal stimuli <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. History shows that politicians resort to "unthinkable" actions when facing economic dilemmas, ultimately exacerbating longer-term inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>. This implies central banks may lack the monetary policy will to truly solve the inflation problem, leading to ongoing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.

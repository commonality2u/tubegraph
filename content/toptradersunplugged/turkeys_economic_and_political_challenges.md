Turkey, though often considered a smaller player in the grand scheme of things, faces significant economic and political challenges that could have wider [[geopolitical_challenges_and_global_macroeconomic_trends | geopolitical ramifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. The country is currently experiencing a two-year economic crisis, marked by inflation rates as high as 80-100%, a stark contrast to its previously stable inflation environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.

## Economic Headwinds

Despite the severe inflation, President Erdogan has managed the situation "shockingly well" thus far, largely due to substantial support from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Russia has been providing Turkey with oil and gas at reduced costs, and sometimes even for free, creating a "massive debt" that will eventually come due <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a>. This transactional relationship implies that Russia is building leverage, which could be used as a "bludgeon" when it suits their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.

Turkey's Central Bank has recently taken steps to dramatically increase interest rates to 40% over the last year, which is starting to show some effect on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. However, this policy goes against Erdogan's preferred economic strategy of loose monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. The question remains whether he can sustain these high rates as economic conditions potentially worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>.

## Political Landscape

President Erdogan is facing an election in approximately two and a half to three years, and for the first time in about two decades, there are minor doubts about his re-election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>. This political pressure, combined with the ongoing economic crisis and Turkey's economy already being "in the gutter" unlike India's, creates a "perfect storm" for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.

Turkey has historically played both sides in geopolitical conflicts, relying on external help due to its value to both the West and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. However, if Russia and the West move towards a more amicable relationship, Turkey's position as a "swing player" could diminish, leading to a loss of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:47">[00:53:47]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications

The situation in Syria also plays a role in Turkey's challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. There's a theory that the Biden Administration deliberately removed military support from forces in Syria (which were backed by Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. This action, occurring as a Trump Administration (friendly with Russia) was anticipated, might have been an attempt to provide Turkey with Syria as a counterweight to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. This move, however, puts Erdogan in direct opposition with Russia, complicating his already difficult position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>.

Turkey is a strategically important ally, especially for Europe, given its large population (almost 100 million people) and its role as a counterweight to Russia within NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:13">[00:58:13]</a>. If the US provides less support, it becomes even more strategic for Europe to shore up its relationship with Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.

Given these converging factors, there is a "decent chance of a currency crisis in Turkey," with the global odds of such crises increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

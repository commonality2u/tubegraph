[[The Turtle Trading Program | The Turtle Trading Program]] was a mentoring initiative led by [[Turtle Trading Program and Richard Dennis | Richard Dennis]] and Bill Eckhart, designed to determine if trading could be taught using a set of rules to achieve profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Elizabeth Cheval, who later founded EMC Capital Advisors, was one of the initial "Turtles" selected for this program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Brian Proctor, also a "Turtle" from the second wave, joined EMC Capital Advisors in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

Being part of the [[The Turtle Trading Program | Turtle Trading Program]] was beneficial for learning from pioneers in the business, emphasizing the importance of [[risk management in trading | managing risk]], building robust systems, and removing emotion from trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy

The core investment philosophy of EMC Capital Advisors, deeply influenced by its [[The Turtle Trading Program | Turtle Trading]] roots, posits that all relevant market information is reflected in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:06">[08:06:06]</a>. Quantitative analysis is considered the most effective method to identify predictable trends in price movements, as historical data indicates markets consistently trend, yielding identifiable and repeatable profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. The objective is to develop and implement quantitative, systematic strategies that deliver long-term positive returns with low correlation to other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

### Trend Following and Momentum Systems

The firm's strategies, which have evolved considerably since the early days, primarily blend two core concepts: trend following and momentum systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Both are designed to capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:10">[09:08:10]</a>.

*   **Trend Following Systems**: These systems confirm current price trends over multiple discrete time frames, such as 180, 40, and 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>. They initiate trades when the price is above a certain portion of the range, confirming a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:00:00">[34:00:00]</a>. Different liquidation criteria differentiate holding periods; some are quicker to liquidate and re-initiate, while others hold positions for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:26:00">[34:26:00]</a>.
*   **Momentum Systems**: These systems analyze time-weighted recent daily data, typically the last two or three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>. One type identifies emerging trends by looking at positive closing prices over various time slices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12:00">[35:12:00]</a>. Another focuses on the speed and magnitude of price action from day to day, kicking in when volatility increases and prices accelerate rapidly in one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:42:00">[35:42:00]</a>.

This blend of systems diversifies entry and exit points for trades across markets, ensuring that even in highly volatile times, at least some systems are active to capture trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a>. Each system carries an equal risk weighting within the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:38:00">[36:38:00]</a>.

The average holding period for positions is typically between 35 to 45 days, placing EMC Capital Advisors as a "medium-term" trend follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. While longer-term systems might yield higher absolute returns with bigger drawdowns, a blend of systems helps improve risk-adjusted returns (e.g., Sharpe or Sortino numbers) and manages overall portfolio volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Strategy and Research

The firm's trading systems have evolved over time, primarily through changes in their parameter sets rather than core logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>. [[Historical evolution and strategy changes in turtle trading | Research and enhancements]] involve continuously re-optimizing systems using new data inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>. This includes incorporating a combination of return metrics over varying time frames, such as historical price data and a 5 or 7-year Sortino number, to improve risk-adjusted returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. Systems also utilize a "short look back window" for adaptiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>.

Key enhancements include:
*   **Volatility Filters**: Each system has a filter that prevents trading in highly volatile market environments (e.g., when historical volatility over 200 days is in the top 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>. This aims to reduce losses and hard stops in choppy conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>.
*   **Range-Dependent System Filter**: Markets must be moving in the desired direction for initiation or liquidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>.
*   **Reactive Volatility Measurement**: Volatility is determined by looking back over only a couple of weeks (a very short look back window), making the system highly reactive to recent changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:35:00">[27:35:00]</a>. This allows for appropriate position sizing (fewer contracts with more volatility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:53:00">[31:53:00]</a>.
*   **Long Bias**: Historically, long trades have been the most profitable, leading to a slight long bias in the portfolio, where long positions are taken at a slightly bigger size than short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.
*   **Walk-Forward Optimization**: The firm uses a staggered, yearly re-optimization process for its systems rather than making wholesale changes at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:54:00">[40:54:00]</a>. This out-of-sample testing ensures reliability and reproducibility by comparing actual trading results to hypothetical out-of-sample performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:33:00">[42:33:00]</a>.

## [[Risk Management in Trading | Risk Management]]

[[Risk management in trading | Risk management]] is considered the most crucial aspect of a CTA's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>. Even with a marginally good blend of trading systems, proper [[Risk management in trading strategies | risk management]] can generate positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:42:00">[50:42:00]</a>.

Key [[Understanding and managing trading risks | risk management]] strategies include:
*   **Max Loss per Trade**: Each system has an automatically generated maximum loss for every trade in every market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Market Risk**: Every market has a limited amount of risk it can take at initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:37:00">[51:37:00]</a>. More aggressive, higher-risk weighted markets might risk about 0.5% per trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:55:00">[51:55:00]</a>.
*   **Volatility-Based Sizing**: Position sizes are adjusted based on market volatility, taking smaller positions when volatility increases and larger ones in more consolidated periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:06:00">[52:06:00]</a>.
*   **Sector Risk Limits**: Maximum risk is also limited per sector (e.g., energy, base metals) to maintain portfolio diversification and prevent overexposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Profit-Taking Algorithm**: A significant departure from traditional [[The Turtle Trading Program | Turtle Trading]] is an algorithm that scales back positions during highly profitable periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. This algorithm considers open trade equity and the size of unliquidated profits at the portfolio level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>. It also incorporates a time element, allowing trends to mature before scaling back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. This strategy, implemented since the late 2000s, helps lock in profits and aligns risk with current volatility, especially when "good vol" (volatility increasing while positioned correctly) drives returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. While it might lead to underperformance during explosive upswings compared to peers, it results in outperformance during reversal periods by cushioning drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:22:00">[56:22:00]</a>. The concept behind this is the decreasing marginal utility of profits for investors; they become more interested in preserving gains than experiencing large drawdowns from trend reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:16:00">[54:16:00]</a>. In aggressive scenarios, positions can be cut back by as much as 60-75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:53:00">[55:53:00]</a>.

The evolution of markets, particularly the increased speed of information flow, necessitates quick adaptation to market moves, especially during steep trend reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:02:00">[59:02:00]</a>. This is another reason for a blend of systems, including shorter-term ones, to allow for nimble liquidation and mitigate deeper drawdowns when many market participants are positioned incorrectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:09:00">[59:09:00]</a>.

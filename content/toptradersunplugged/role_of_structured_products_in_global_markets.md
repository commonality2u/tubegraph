[[structured_financial_products | Structured financial products]] play a significant and often underestimated role in [[global market trends and investment strategies | global financial markets]], particularly in relation to [[volatility_trading_and_market_structure | volatility]] and [[global capital flows and their effects on asset markets | capital flows]]. They are characterized by varying levels of Vega risk and negative asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Historical Context and Growth

While derivatives have existed since the 1970s, [[structured_financial_products | structured products]] as a global phenomenon truly gained traction in the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

Historically, Asia has been a prominent region for the use of [[structured_financial_products | structured products]]. For instance, in June 2021, private banks across Singapore and Hong Kong saw a massive surge in accumulator products tied to major Chinese tech companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Ping An <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, within three months, many of these products "blown up," leading to rumors of billions of dollars in unrecognized losses across numerous banks within six months, despite individual ticket sizes being relatively small ($50,000 to $100,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Japanese banks have also been significant investors in synthetic credit products globally, including CLO structures in Europe and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. Their role as the largest single investor in many significant structures means that shifts, such as Norenchukin reducing CLO purchases, can have major implications for US CLO markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

## Current Dynamics and Market Impact

The demand for [[structured_financial_products | structured products]] has seen significant year-over-year growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. This surge is driven by a clear value proposition, especially in an environment with higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. Derivatives, being capital efficient, allow investors to achieve higher yields by stacking [[structured_financial_products | structured products]] on top of existing rates, which is appealing in increasingly volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>.

The widespread selling of [[volatility_trading_and_market_structure | volatility]] embedded in these products is a key factor in [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility | volatility compression]] within the core of financial indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>. This contrasts with earlier periods where money would typically move from the stock market to the bond market during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:20">[01:08:20]</a>.

[[structured_financial_products | Structured products]] involve selling non-recourse leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>. As markets evolved, these products became more complex, longer-dated, and embedded with higher-order risks (third and fourth moment risks), increasing the leverage applied to the structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. This extensive selling of [[volatility_trading_and_market_structure | volatility]] has led to a supply-driven inverted term structure in Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.

Furthermore, the opening of overnight trading desks for VIX and S&P Vol by exchanges like CBOE and CME has shifted significant trading volume to the S&P Vol, driven by [[structured_financial_products | structured product]] activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

## Risks and Challenges

The primary risk associated with [[structured_financial_products | structured products]] is the need to buy back this non-recourse leverage when the market unwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>. This was observed in 2008 following Lehman's collapse, where S&P Volatility (VIX) spiked, and while 12-month S&P Volatility remained relatively stable, the need to repurchase long-dated variance and convexity risk led to massive payouts for those who had owned these positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

There is a disparity in market access for retail investors: it is difficult for them to invest in convex strategies that protect capital, yet they are increasingly allowed to invest in [[structured_financial_products | structured products]] that expose them to "unbounded ridiculous risk" with negative asymmetric return dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This highlights a concern regarding the measurement and capitalization of risks in these complex structures, especially given the embedded correlation assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>.

The scale of [[structured_financial_products | structured product]] activity and the inherent Vega risk and negative asymmetry taken on by market participants are phenomenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>. This poses a [[global financial stability risks | significant risk]] if these structures become more complex and longer-dated, as seen in Asia, leading to a broader range of [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility | volatility suppression]] and potential future dislocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.# Role of Structured Products in Global Markets

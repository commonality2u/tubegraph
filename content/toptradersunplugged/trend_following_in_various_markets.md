[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following]] is an investment strategy that seeks to profit from sustained upward or downward movements in market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It is described as a dependable and consistent, yet often overlooked, investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This approach focuses on rules-based investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Loose Pants Fits Everyone
A key philosophical approach to developing and trading a system, particularly in [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]], is the concept of "loose pants fits everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This means that markets are highly unpredictable in the short term, so a system should not be overly specific or constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Systems should be designed to hold positions through various market types, building in flexibility to stay with the strategy through challenging scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Fine-tuning a system has generally not been a good strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Risk Management
Accepting and managing risk is crucial for any trading system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. The focus should be on managing risk, as returns cannot be controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Volatility Stabilization (Targeting)
A significant improvement in systematic trading, including [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]], is volatility stabilization or targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Measurement**: Risk should be measured by the system's performance on daily returns or NAVs, rather than the underlying volatility of individual markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Target**: The industry standard for portfolio volatility targeting is around 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This involves calculating the annualized volatility of the portfolio based on recent returns (e.g., last 20-40 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Adjustment**: If volatility goes above the target, positions are cut to bring it down; if it goes below, leverage is increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. These adjustments are not typically daily (e.g., only when volatility moves by 20% from the target) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: The primary benefit of volatility stabilization is achieved by raising the portfolio's exposure when volatility is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. When volatility drops significantly (e.g., to 6-8%), returns can be reduced by nearly 50% if positions aren't increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Conversely, reducing volatility when it's high (and returns may not justify the risk) improves the return-to-risk ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Caution**: Fine-tuning systems to reduce risk is generally ineffective as risk tends to "pop up" elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Extreme Risk Exit
Even with diversification, periods of crisis can cause correlations to go to one, leading to all markets reversing simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:36">[01:23:36]</a>. An "extreme risk exit" rule is employed in systems to protect against this: if portfolio volatility exceeds a certain high threshold (e.g., 32% annualized for stocks) AND the market is net down for several days, the system bails out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:42">[01:31:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:50">[01:31:50]</a>.

## Market Selection and Diversification
Position sizing is critical for risk control, and the first step is ensuring every trade has the same risk (equal risk or volatility parity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:21">[01:17:21]</a>. If one trade has greater risk, it must justify it with higher returns, which is difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

### Selecting Markets by Performance
Markets can be ranked by their performance under the rules of the trading system, focusing on returns only, not risk-adjusted returns like the Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:30">[02:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>. The more restrictions placed on performance (like using Sharpe ratio), the worse future results tend to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:44">[02:18:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:02">[02:22:02]</a>.
*   **Persistence**: The belief is that markets performing best on a system will continue to do so, like Amazon or Tesla stocks that keep trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.
*   **Ranking Process**: Returns of each market are ranked over a short period (e.g., last 60 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:51">[02:27:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:58">[02:57:58]</a>. The top-performing markets are selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:11">[02:16:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:19">[02:16:19]</a>. This ranking is re-evaluated frequently (e.g., daily), and markets dropping significantly in rank are replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:20">[02:28:20]</a>. This process can reduce the holding period from 30-40 trading days to about 18 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:44">[02:48:44]</a>.

### Diversification Debate
*   **Perry's View**: Once 10 non-correlated markets are in a portfolio, it is well-diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. Over-diversification can deteriorate overall performance by including marginally profitable markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:25">[02:06:25]</a>. If only one sector qualifies for trading, total exposure should be reduced (e.g., to 50%) to manage risk, only leveraging up to full exposure with more diverse sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:33">[03:34:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:50">[03:39:50]</a>.
*   **Niels/Moritz's View**: While the mathematical benefit of diversification declines after a certain number of markets, it's not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. As long as a market's correlation is not perfectly one, it offers a "free snack" of diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:34">[01:18:34]</a>. This is based on the law of large numbers, where more diverse markets increase the chance of catching the "rockstar performance" market next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

### Efficiency Ratio for Market Selection
The efficiency ratio measures the "drunken sailor's walk" of a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. It's calculated as the net price change over a period (e.g., 10-20 days) divided by the sum of individual daily movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.
*   **Interpretation**: A ratio of 1 indicates a perfectly trending market (goes up every day), while a ratio near zero indicates a noisy market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.
*   **Application**: For [[Trend following strategies|trend following strategies]], markets with higher efficiency ratios are preferred, typically interest rate markets and then FX markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. For mean reversion, the noisiest markets (like equity indices) are chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This ratio is used for initial portfolio definition and not typically for ongoing trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>.

## Profit Targets and Stop Losses in [[Trend Following Investment Strategies|Trend Following Investment Strategies]]
*   **Profit Targets**: They work extremely well for short-term trading where there's no expectation of continued price direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. Taking profits in multiple parts (e.g., three equal parts based on average expected profit) can reduce risk and prevent turning a profit into a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. However, profit targets do not work for [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] because [[Trend following investment strategies|trend following investment strategies]] rely on capturing "fat tail" events – those long, sustained moves (like interest rates, Tesla, Amazon, Apple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:04">[00:46:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. Taking profits means not being in for the long term, which can be a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:25">[00:46:25]</a>.
*   **Stop Losses**: Similarly, rigid stop losses in [[Trend following as a trading strategy|long-term trend systems]] can prevent capturing the "fat tail" if the market reverses and then continues in the desired direction after the stop out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. Both profit targets and stop losses often necessitate re-entry rules, which complicate the system and typically lead to inferior long-term results compared to simply staying with the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.

## Performance in Different Market Types
[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following strategies]] perform differently across various markets based on their inherent characteristics.
*   **Mature/Liquid Markets**: Counter-intuitively, as markets mature and liquidity increases (e.g., with retail investors, institutional funds), they tend to become noisier and less ideal for [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This "noise" comes from random inflows/outflows of money not driven by fundamental logic, such as retirement account rebalancing or personal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates/Bonds**: These markets have consistently been the best-performing sector for [[Trend following strategies|trend followers]] for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. Their trends are largely driven by central bank policy, which involves incremental interest rate adjustments over long periods (e.g., six months to a year of manipulation) to dampen or encourage economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. Bond markets are often considered "long-only" for profitable [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.
*   **FX Markets**: These are generally the next most trending markets after interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Interest rate policy significantly affects forex as money flows to countries with higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. However, major currencies have been "stuck in ranges" in recent years, making them difficult for [[Trend following strategies|trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. FX tends to have shorter periods of trending than interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Equities**: Equity markets exhibit very violent but short-lived declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. For [[Trend following as a trading strategy|long-term trend systems]], by the time a short position is entered, much of the move is already over, making it difficult to profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. There is a "gigantic bias to the upside" in stocks over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Alpha**: In extreme events like 2008, being short leveraged S&P futures produced significant profits, demonstrating "crisis alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. However, such opportunities have been rare since then, with downturns being too fast to capture profitability with [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following trading strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>. Consequently, some [[Trend following trading strategies|long-term trend following systems]] do not trade the short side of equity index markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:06">[01:04:06]</a>.
    *   **Individual Stocks vs. Indices**: Trading individual stocks rather than equity indices (baskets of stocks) is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Equity indices have a massive survivorship bias, as they exclude stocks that go bankrupt or to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:52">[01:06:52]</a>.
*   **Commodities (Crude Oil, Agriculture)**: These markets often have faster trends than interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. Crude oil trends are primarily driven by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. Agricultural markets (grains) often require shorter time periods (e.g., a 20-day moving average) to capture seasonal moves that may only last a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. Historically, grain prices have declined on an inflation-adjusted basis due to technological advancements leading to bumper crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **Metals**: Gold has seen strong long-side performance, potentially linked to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>.

## Is [[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend Following]] Dead?
The perception that [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] might be "dead" after periods of subpar performance is a recurring topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>.
*   **Economic Drivers**: The largest trends are driven by the economy, starting with the bond market and central bank policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>. These fundamental trends still exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.
*   **Increased Noise**: While trends continue, increased market noise means [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following trading strategies]] identify trend changes later, leading to smaller extractable portions of the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>. This requires adjustments to portfolio or leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>.

## Ongoing Research and Discoveries
*   **Multiple Parameters**: Using multiple parameters in [[Trend following trading strategies|trend systems]] helps make expected returns more realistic and smooths out performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>. By diversifying across different calculation speeds (e.g., slow to fast moving averages), a trader accepts an average return, acknowledging that they don't know which will perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:56">[01:36:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   **Extreme Risk Control**: This has been a recent addition to [[Trend following strategies|trend systems]] in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>. It addresses the possibility of all markets turning against a system due to money flowing out during a crisis, causing correlations to go to one regardless of individual market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:07">[01:23:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:31]</a>. If volatility is high and there's a downside shock, the system bails out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.

## Personal Trading Philosophies
*   **Moritz's Evolution**: While initially involved in designing systems with strict volatility targeting for structured products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:18">[01:12:18]</a>, Moritz shifted away from rigid ongoing volatility control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>. This was due to:
    *   Cost savings from reduced adjustments (commissions, fees, slippage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>.
    *   Avoiding a skewed exposure to a single sector (e.g., fixed income) due to leveraging dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>.
    *   Observation that volatility control trades increased average losses when separated from true system trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:37">[01:14:37]</a>.
*   **Trader Comfort**: Ultimately, the choice of risk management and position sizing must align with the trader's comfort level to ensure adherence to the system over the long term, which is crucial for [[Trend following strategies|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:31">[01:16:31]</a>.

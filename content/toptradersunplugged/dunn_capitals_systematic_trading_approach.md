Dunn Capital Management, led by President Marty Bergen, is recognized as one of the oldest and most successful [[Systematic Trading Strategies|systematic managers]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The firm's success spans over four decades in the CTA industry, attributed to its unique approach and key research discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. October 2014 marked the 40th anniversary of Bill Dunn's trading career and the 30th anniversary of the WMA program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Early Development
At its core, Dunn Capital's approach applies technology to portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Bill Dunn, after serving in the military and working in the defense industry, sought a better way to make a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. He realized that markets could be analyzed using mathematical or statistical data to determine buy and sell points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Originally, Bill focused on equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, in the 1970s, the lack of personal computers and computing power made it impractical to process the vast amount of data required for equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This led him to futures, where only about a dozen commodity contracts were traded at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

In the 1970s, Bill and his son Daniel manually entered data using punch cards and rented time on mainframes or used library computers to run their systems and generate daily trading prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Dunn Capital still keeps a set of these mid-70s punch cards as a historical artifact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Bill Dunn's fundamental principle is that all trading decisions are 100% statistical, based purely on price data, with no subjective or fundamental data involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. They trade in highly liquid markets, ensuring transparent pricing and easy valuation of positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Bill's initial aim was to make money for himself and others, and the firm's first seed capital came from co-workers, friends, and family, some of whom remain investors today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Evolution of the Trading System
The firm's [[Evolution of Dunn Capitals trading strategies|evolution of Dunn Capital's trading strategies]] and continued success are attributed to continuous research and adaptation, leveraging technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Significant Upgrades and Changes
Dunn Capital has implemented several key upgrades to its system:

*   **2006: Portfolio-Centric Approach** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>
    *   Previously, each market was treated individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
    *   The significant shift involved designing models based on the portfolio as a whole, ensuring every market traded within the same model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.
    *   Parameter selection was also done on a portfolio-wide basis, making the systems more robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
    *   The number of models increased from three per market to upward of 100, combined to determine a strength (plus one or negative one) for each market, and trades executed at the market open each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
    *   This expansion allowed for migration between shorter-term and longer-term trends, increasing adaptability and flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
    *   The program expanded beyond financial markets to include commodities, facilitated by increased volume and electronic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

*   **2008: Dynamic Risk Adjustment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>
    *   Implemented dynamic risk adjustment, where risk is adjusted daily based on market conditions, rather than fixed historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

*   **2011: Two Algorithm Classes and Portfolio Expansion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>
    *   Introduced two algorithm classes. One, the original system Bill designed in the 70s, is a full reversal program always in the market (either long or short) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The other algo can be long, short, or flat and includes a stop-loss function not based on price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
    *   These two algo types, while having some correlation, provide better overall performance than either standing alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
    *   Added "meats" to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

*   **2013: Adaptive Risk Profile (ARP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>
    *   Implemented the Adaptive Risk Profile (ARP) to adjust the Value at Risk (VAR) target daily based on market conditions, rather than a fixed VAR target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>.
    *   This system assesses whether the environment is favorable for [[Systematic Investing Strategies|trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. A better trending environment leads to a higher targeting mechanism, while reduced trendiness leads to a lower target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.
    *   The VAR has significantly reduced from somewhere in the mid-30s to 23-24%, without sacrificing upside profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
    *   ARP considers individual market trending, correlation to other markets, and market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

## Current Operations
Dunn Capital currently manages the WMA program, which has two versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>:
*   **Original WMA**: Targets a high volatility, high return profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Historically, Bill set the VAR as a 1% chance of losing 20% or more in a month, a target maintained until January 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Institutional WMA**: Has half the VAR of the original system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

The firm runs approximately $300 million in the high volatility program and $100 million in the institutional product (as of the interview) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Operational Structure
Dunn Capital handles all operations in-house, including administration, accounting, and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This integrated approach ensures timeliness and direct investor interaction, while significantly reducing costs compared to outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

### Market Selection
Dunn Capital currently trades 53 markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. When considering new markets, they look for:
*   Trading on a regulated exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>.
*   High and consistent volume over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.
*   Uncorrelation to the existing portfolio to provide diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.
*   Viability to exit positions when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

The 53 markets cover all sectors, providing full diversification, unlike some larger managers who are more concentrated in financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. For example, 23% of their allocation is in agricultures, while only 13% is in currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.

### Position Management
At the end of each day, Dunn Capital determines desired positions based on available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. They then adjust current positions daily, using a small threshold to avoid excessive trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. The algorithms rely purely on high, low, and close price data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

Marty Bergen believes that risk management and portfolio development are the primary drivers of their superior performance, more so than the specific design of the algorithms, which he believes are not drastically different from what other [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies|trend following]] firms use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.

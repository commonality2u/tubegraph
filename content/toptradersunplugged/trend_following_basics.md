## Introduction to Systematic Investing and Trend Following

Niels Kaastra-Larson introduces systematic investing as a "raw and honest journey" into the world of investments, highlighting [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] as a dependable, consistent, yet often overlooked strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The *Systematic Investor Series* takes the pulse of global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Market Overview (May 2022)
In May 2022, markets experienced confusion due to rising inflation, particularly evident in the US and Europe with headlines of 8-8.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. European policymakers faced challenges like Russia turning off gas supplies and Turkey's stance on Sweden and Finland joining NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. A significant divergence in inflation rates within the Eurozone was observed, with Malta at 5.6% and Estonia at 20.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, posing a challenge for the ECB's single interest rate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. US officials, including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, admitted previous misjudgments regarding inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, further contributing to market uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Key Components of [[Trend Following Strategies | Trend Following Strategies]]

### Stops: Initial and Trailing
Richard Brennan employs a comprehensive workflow process that uses data, not discretion, to place initial and trailing stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. He uses a vast array of market data to ensure stops respond to multiple possible market histories, not just a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. For [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] models, an Average True Range (ATR) based initial and trailing stop is applied across many alternate histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Niels and Rich advocate for "loose pants" in stop placement, meaning giving the markets a lot of leeway for initial and trailing stops to avoid being stopped out too soon during retracements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This concept is attributed to Perry Kaufman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. While "loose pants" are preferred, they shouldn't be "too loose" to prevent excessive give-backs when a trend turns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. It's crucial to have a trailing stop; an initial stop alone is insufficient as it doesn't account for profit protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

> [!INFO] ATR for Normalization
> ATR is favored because it not only helps define stops but also normalizes systems to different market price structures like cryptocurrencies, commodities, or forex, allowing the same model to be applied across diverse markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Risk Management
When using percentage risk per trade, it should be relative to the closed equity balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. As the number of markets increases, more exposure can be gained in leveraged instruments with small trade risk percentages, but the portfolio's "heat" (risk if everything moved to stop) increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. A measure of portfolio heat helps assess the theoretical maximum adverse risk, though positions may be hedged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. Diversification with uncorrelated return streams is essential to avoid over-exposure to positively correlated environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>.

For a [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] model, the "open risk to stop" (potential loss if all positions hit their stops) typically ranges between 10% and 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>. It's not a sprint but a marathon; keeping risk conservative ensures the ability to "fight another day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>. The goal of diversification is to reduce trade risk as low as possible to achieve the lowest risk exposure per return stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>. Starting with the lowest leverage and diversifying broadly is advised before considering increasing trade risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>. Professional firms often risk as little as 0.15% per market across hundreds of markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

### Diversification
Diversification is considered a "secret sauce" of [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. While some traders find success with limited markets (e.g., three products selected quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, this is often seen as cross-sectional momentum rather than broadly diversified systematic [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. True [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] involves a fixed portfolio of markets where a signal is always calculated for each position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Staying with exchange-listed, liquid products is recommended to manage tail risk, counterparty risk, and regulatory risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

### Trend Regime Filters
Applying regime filters can be a good idea, such as using a long-term lookback for breakouts or a 200-day simple moving average to filter trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>. These filters help target the "tail regions" of the return distribution, being selective in which trends to participate in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. However, caution is advised against adding too many filters, which can lead to over-optimization, making backtests look artificially good with few losing trades and small drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. Sticking to "classic simple [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]]" is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

## Common Challenges and Misconceptions

### Drawdowns and Sticking to the System
Sticking to system rules during drawdowns requires discipline and commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Expecting large drawdowns is crucial; as sample size increases, so do drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Bill Dunn, a notable [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend follower]], experienced his largest drawdowns (50%) only after 20 years of operation due to continuous extending sample size and entering new regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

To prepare for future drawdowns, it's advised to test models on unseen data, which can reveal a significantly higher expected drawdown than a cherry-picked backtest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. A long track record of surviving difficult times, even with large drawdowns, is a sign of strength and resilience, not weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. A rule of thumb is that a [[Trend Following Strategies | trend following]] firm's maximum drawdown might be four to six times its monthly standard deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Backtest Limitations
> Past performance in backtests does not necessarily reflect future results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>. Manual interventions, such as reducing leverage during stressful periods, can skew backtest relevance and are often not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

### Over-optimization and Time-Based Exits
Over-optimizing a system by adding too many filters can lead to unrealistic backtest results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. Time-based exits (e.g., exiting if a trade isn't profitable after 'x' days) are generally not recommended for longer-term [[Trend Following Strategies | trend following]] systems because they might cut off trends that start slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. Trends can trade sideways for a month before taking off, and prematurely exiting would be a missed opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. These types of exits are more effective for momentum models, not typically for [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>.

### Cross-Sectional Momentum vs. [[Trend Following Strategies | Trend Following Strategies]]
Cross-sectional momentum methods, like Gary Antonacci's dual momentum, involve selecting a handful of top performers based on recent performance and continually rotating in and out of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. While successful for some traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>, Rich and Niels generally prefer traditional [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. The concern is that cross-sectional momentum tends to buy past winners, potentially missing the initial significant part of a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:57">[01:04:57]</a>. [[Trend Following Strategies | Trend following]] aims to capture "outliers" whose causal drivers may only be apparent in hindsight, making it a more uncertain but potentially more rewarding approach for large moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:05">[01:04:05]</a>.

## Measuring [[Trend Following Strategies | Trend Following Strategies]] Performance: Indexes

### Global Funds Management and Managed Futures Allocation
The total hedge fund industry assets under management (AUM) were around $5.136 trillion as of Q1 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. The managed futures CTA industry stood at $360 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, with approximately 75% ($275-300 billion) likely allocated to [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. This figure has remained relatively stagnant for many years but is experiencing a resurgence in performance and inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>. Australia, in particular, appears to be "underrepresented" in [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

### Comparison of [[Trend Following Strategies | Trend Following]] Indexes
Several indexes track the performance of the managed futures industry and [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]].

*   **SG Trend Index:** Focuses on the 10 largest [[Trend Following Strategies | trend following]] CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

It is an equally weighted index, rebalanced and reconstituted annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:40">[01:07:40]</a>.
*   **BTOP50 Index:** Aims to track the largest investable trading advisor programs by AUM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:34">[01:08:34]</a>. Despite its name, it only included 20 constituents as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:16">[01:08:16]</a>. It has similar criteria to SG Trend, requiring at least three years of operating history and two years of trading activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>. The portfolio is equally weighted at the beginning of each calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:57">[01:08:57]</a>. Niels notes that some constituents may not strictly be [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:27">[01:09:27]</a>.
*   **TTU [[Trend Following Strategies | Trend Following]] Index:** Created by Niels and Rich, this index prioritizes a long track record over size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Criteria:** Geographically diversified across asset classes, fully systematic, at least a 15-year unbroken track record, adopts [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] techniques as the dominant strategy, currently investable, and reports at least monthly via the Niesen Hedge database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:55">[01:10:55]</a>.
    *   **Construction:** Equally weighted, rebalanced and reconstituted monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>.

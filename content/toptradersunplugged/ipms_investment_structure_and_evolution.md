IPM is a firm co-founded and chaired by Anders Lindell, known for its systematic global macro strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>. The firm manages over $7 billion, with approximately $3 billion in its systematic macro program and $4 billion in its systematic long-only equity program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:53">[02:59:53]</a>.

## Foundational Philosophy and Early Influences

Anders Lindell's investment philosophy was significantly shaped by early career experiences and major market events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>. Initially trained as an engineer, he focused on control theory and mathematics, designing systems for paper and pulp mills that required structured, repeatable, and controllable responses to various inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This background instilled a preference for a [[systematic_investment_strategies | rule-based or mechanical approach]] to managing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Key market events that influenced him include:
*   The equity crash of 1987, where he lost personal trading profits, highlighting the importance of understanding all aspects before trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   The attack on the Swedish Central Bank in 1992, where overnight rates reached 500% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   The 1994 Fed hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

These events, particularly the extreme market reactions, solidified his focus on finding value by "going against price drift and dislocation away from the fair value or intrinsic value of markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. He learned the value of patience and solid analysis, observing how global macro hedge funds took long-term views on positions, expecting them to play out over years rather than months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He also recognized that an economy changes slowly, making it important to focus on longer-term developments rather than individual data points, which can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

## Inception of IPM and Its Mission

IPM was founded in early 1998 by Anders Lindell and his co-founding partner, who also worked at JP Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. The idea stemmed from their interactions with institutional clients, such as pension funds and life insurance companies, who struggled with tactical [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation | asset allocation]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

Traditionally, these institutions made decisions through investment committees, compiling and analyzing data from various economists and research reports on a monthly or quarterly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. This process was prone to noise and rarely led to significant, needle-turning decisions, often resulting in only modest adjustments to asset allocations like a 60/40 bond/stock split changing to 58/42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:27:00">[14:27:00]</a>. IPM aimed to provide a more formalized, repeatable [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment service]] based on a solid set of information and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:57]</a>.

## Core Investment Philosophy: Systematic Global Macro

IPM's core approach is 100% systematic, meaning "everything that we do inside these two programs is actually coded into software code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. This structure allows for significant scalability of the organization's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:46:00">[30:46:00]</a>.

The objective of the strategy is to take [[investing_strategies_and_risk_management | risk]] in proportion to identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:00:00">[54:00:00]</a>. It's designed to deliver around 10% net per annum at a risk level (expected volatility) of just south of one in terms of Sharpe ratio, acknowledging that higher Sharpe ratios are unrealistic for this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>.

The strategy is built on the belief that markets, over a reasonable time period, respond rationally to fundamental variables like GDP, inflation, money supply, and trade balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20:00">[52:20:00]</a>. It relies on the principle of mean reversion, where markets that deviate from underlying fundamental development will eventually return to equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:54:00">[52:54:00]</a>.

### Key Aspects of the Model:

*   **Relative Trading**: IPM's strategy involves playing markets in a very relative sense, trading, for example, US equities against German equities or Canadian government bonds against Japanese government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31:00">[40:31:00]</a>. This makes the model less sensitive to absolute price levels or broad market regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:56:00">[40:56:00]</a>.
*   **Global Composites**: All modeling is done in relation to global composites, forming synthetic instruments. For instance, the Japanese Yen is analyzed against a global basket of currencies, not just specific currency pairs like USD/JPY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
*   **Risk-Adjusted Deviation**: Everything is modeled in relation to its own history and risk-adjusted, using "Z-scores" to measure standard deviations from long-term equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>.
*   **Five Sub-Models (Dimensions)**: The core model operates across five dimensions, which are essentially sub-models based on asset classes:
    1.  Relative models on [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | Emerging Market currencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>
    2.  Developed currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>
    3.  Equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>
    4.  Fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>
    5.  Directional components (formerly known as global asset class decisions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>
*   **Four Common Themes (Factors)**: Within each of the five sub-models, four common themes or factors are applied:
    1.  **Value**: Identifying valuation drivers (e.g., purchasing power parity for currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
    2.  **Risk Premium**: Trading risk premiums (e.g., Carry for currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
    3.  **Macroeconomic Factors**: Accounting for macroeconomic developments (e.g., money supply changes, government debt issuance, trade balance shifts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
    4.  **Market Dynamics**: Idiosyncratic factors specific to each asset class (e.g., yield curve for bonds, cross-border investment flows for currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

IPM always maintains positions across all markets and themes, with varying degrees of exposure proportional to identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

## Organizational Structure

IPM's systematic nature dictates its lean organizational structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>. At its heart is a research team of about 10 people, supported by four systems developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. Their primary task is to maintain and further develop the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>. Three traders and a couple of risk personnel handle daily trading and supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>. A small middle office (four persons) handles traditional tasks like risk checks, position checks, and reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:56:00">[31:56:00]</a>. The rest of the firm comprises traditional functions like legal, compliance, IT infrastructure, and business development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>.

The systematic approach allows IPM to scale its AUM significantly without needing to employ a large number of new people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. Talent acquisition is needs-based; IPM identifies specific skill gaps within its team and then actively seeks that particular talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>. Compensation and retention focus on job satisfaction, interesting work, and recognition, with financial rewards based on overall company earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and contribution to long-term business development and idea sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Strategy

IPM's strategy has undergone a continuous, long-term evolutionary process, rather than short-term drastic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:27:00">[45:27:00]</a>. Typically, two to three changes are introduced to the model annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>. These can include:
*   Additions of new risk factors or sub-models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:42:00">[45:42:00]</a>.
*   Introduction of new risk analytics methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>.
*   Inclusion of entirely new models or asset classes (e.g., Emerging Market currencies were added only recently) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:03:00">[46:03:00]</a>.

### Significant Changes and Challenges

One of the most significant philosophical changes occurred around 2010 when IPM relaxed the traditional [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | tactical asset allocation]] restriction that required every long position to be balanced by a similar short position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:29:00">[46:29:00]</a>. This allowed the strategy to be simultaneously long or short both global stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18:00">[47:18:00]</a>. This shift was prompted by:
*   Moving away from the classic Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA) setting.
*   Recognizing that balancing dollar amounts did not achieve risk neutrality.
*   Changes in asset class correlation structures over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:42:00">[47:42:00]</a>.

While the fundamental basis of the model remains robust, certain market environments pose [[investment_challenges_and_opportunities | challenges]]. Specifically, periods where central banks heavily intervene (like the last six years) can disrupt the model's optimal performance if markets disregard fundamentals and primarily respond to central bank actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>. However, even in such stretched market conditions, the relative nature of IPM's trading allows for continued opportunities as markets still trade around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:43:00">[57:43:00]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Adaptation

As the world becomes more integrated, and authorities attempt to control markets, IPM continuously seeks new opportunities by expanding into other instruments, asset classes, and segments (e.g., other equity markets, potential commodities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:32:00">[56:32:00]</a>. The firm's long-term reliance on fundamental drivers, like relative inflation impacting currency pairs, means that even if market dislocations occur, they are expected to revert over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>.

The core belief is that the underlying theory remains sound, and deviations are temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. The firm's [[risks_and_trends_in_current_investment_strategies | systematic approach]] is designed to adapt, constantly improving the process and identifying weaknesses to research and fix them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>. This ensures that the models evolve without necessarily experiencing "model decay," unless a fundamental change, like a central bank pegging a currency, renders an instrument completely unresponsive to fundamental information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

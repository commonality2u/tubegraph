India, often seen as the world's largest country by population and a potential counterweight to China, is frequently highlighted by Western institutions like McKinsey and Morgan Stanley as an economic success story. However, Ashok Modi, a visiting professor of international economic policy at Princeton and author of "India is Broken," presents a more somber view of the nation's current state and future prospects, suggesting that the prevailing narrative misses critical underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | common narrative]]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>.

## Personal Motivation and a Critical Perspective
Ashok Modi, born and raised in India, studied electronic engineering before transitioning to economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>. Despite becoming a U.S. citizen in 2018 and giving up his Indian citizenship (as India does not allow dual citizenship), he feels "Indian at heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45">[07:45]</a>. This deep connection motivated him to write "India is Broken" because the prevalent narrative of India being "on the go" and a competitor to China did not align with the lived reality he observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>. He believes understanding India's history is crucial, as early choices have increasingly limited its options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59">[09:59]</a>.

## Unmet Challenges Since Independence
In 1947, newly independent India faced three major challenges:
1.  Increasing agricultural productivity to make farmers more productive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48">[10:48]</a>.
2.  Creating good urban jobs for a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52">[10:52]</a>.
3.  Competing internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57">[10:57]</a>.

Seventy-five years later, these challenges remain largely unmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12">[11:12]</a>.

## The "Two Indias"
Modi's analysis posits the existence of "two Indias," reflecting a profound [[generational_power_shifts_and_inequality | social and economic divide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40">[23:40]</a>.

### The First India (Elite)
This segment, estimated at 10-15% of the population, lives "first world lives" and is largely insulated from the problems faced by the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51">[23:51]</a>. Characteristics include:
*   Excellent education, often attending elite institutions or studying abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50">[22:50]</a>.
*   Access to high-quality water systems and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13">[26:13]</a>.
*   Ability to navigate the judicial system through connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21">[26:21]</a>.
*   Insulation from severe [[environmental_and_urban_development_issues_in_india | environmental issues]] like air pollution through personal purifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:51">[26:51]</a>.
*   Primary connection to the "second India" is through access to cheap labor (housekeepers, maids, shoppers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:20">[27:20]</a>.

### The Second India (Majority)
This represents the vast majority (80-85%) of the population, facing significant disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22">[24:22]</a>. Key issues include:
*   Poor access to education and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25">[24:25]</a>.
*   Low women's participation in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29">[24:29]</a>.
*   High rates of underemployment and unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19">[25:19]</a>.

## Economic Development and the Jobs Deficit
India's post-independence [[economic_development_models_postindian_independence | development model]] diverged significantly from successful East Asian countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>.

### The East Asian Model
These countries, starting with a large agricultural workforce, focused on:
*   **Transferring labor:** Moving people from low-productivity agriculture to higher-productivity urban jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47">[12:47]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing growth:** Creating urban jobs through labor-intensive manufacturing, starting with low-value-added goods and gradually moving up the value chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56">[14:56]</a>.
*   **Universal primary education:** Ensuring an educated workforce for productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12">[15:12]</a>.
*   **Women in the workforce:** Increasing female participation to boost productivity and reduce gender disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18">[15:18]</a>.
*   **Aggressive currency devaluation:** Using a relatively cheap currency to make goods competitive internationally, even if initially of lower quality, fostering learning and upgrading over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26">[15:26]</a>.

### India's Chosen Path: "Building Temples"
India did not adopt the East Asian model for the first 35 years after independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42">[15:42]</a>. Under Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the focus was on:
*   **Heavy industry and big projects:** Developing sectors like aerospace and locomotives, which were capital-intensive and created very few jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54">[19:54]</a>.
*   **Tertiary (Elite) Education:** Prioritizing elite institutions like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) over universal primary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02">[21:02]</a>.

This led to several critical problems:
*   **Neglect of primary education:** For a long time, the majority did not attend primary school, and even with increased enrollment, poor teaching quality and corruption in the system mean many fifth graders struggle with second-grade level tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29">[21:29]</a>.
*   **Educational disparity:** A small elite receives excellent education, often migrating abroad, while the vast majority lacks basic skills, limiting job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50">[22:50]</a>.
*   **Limited job creation:** The emphasis on heavy industry did not absorb the growing workforce, leading to a significant "jobs deficit" estimated to be 100 million or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:56">[24:56]</a>.
*   **Stagnant exports:** India's share of global manufactured goods exports has stagnated at around 1.8% since 2012, while countries like Vietnam have surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:15">[39:15]</a>.

#### The Gujarat Model
The "Gujarat Model of Development," implemented when Narendra Modi was chief minister of Gujarat, is seen as a modern version of the "building temples" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:59">[37:59]</a>. This model involved:
*   Generous subsidization of large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:18">[35:18]</a>.
*   Relatively cheap land and low-interest loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:25">[35:25]</a>.
*   Lax environmental clearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:31">[35:31]</a>.

While this led to high GDP growth rates in Gujarat, it was not significantly job-creating, as it still favored capital-intensive industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56">[35:56]</a>. This model also exacerbated [[environmental_and_urban_development_issues_in_india | environmental degradation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43">[36:43]</a>.

## Societal Disintegration and Suppression
The lack of jobs for the majority contributes to significant [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | societal issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:43">[36:43]</a>.

### Lack of Public Anger and Protest
Despite widespread underemployment and economic distress, there isn't a greater sense of public anger spilling into the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:57">[27:57]</a>. This is attributed to:
*   **Coercive state power:** Protests are met with a heavy hand, supported by laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which allows indefinite detention without timely trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34">[28:34]</a>.
*   **Attraction to low-grade criminal activity:** Some frustrated youth turn to organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53">[29:53]</a>.
*   **Channeling energies into Hindu nationalism (Hindutva):** Since the mid-1980s, young, frustrated individuals have become "foot soldiers" for the Hindutva movement, an ideology of Hindu nationalism that prioritizes cultural and geographical identity over strict religious adherence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05">[30:05]</a>. This movement gained significant political focal point with the Babri Masjid dispute and led to the rise of Prime Minister Modi's party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:15">[33:15]</a>.

### [[Crime and Politics in India]]
The nexus between crime and politics has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30">[00:30]</a>. As of 2023:
*   25% of legislators in the Indian national Parliament are accused of serious crimes like rape, murder, extortion, and kidnapping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09">[00:09]</a>.
*   In some state governments, like Bihar, this figure rises to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27">[00:27]</a>.
*   This creates a "bad equilibrium" where no one has an incentive to change the system, leading to persistent corruption and criminality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42">[00:42]</a>.
*   Illegal sand mining is a major source of organized crime, with powerful mafias infiltrating politics at all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:31">[49:31]</a>.

### Erosion of Data Integrity and Press Freedoms
India, once known for its professional Civil Service producing quality data, now faces a "data fog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57">[39:57]</a>.
*   **Employment statistics:** Government-published numbers showing enormous job growth are considered "nonsense" by labor economists, and actual trends show no job growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35">[41:35]</a>.
*   **Poverty numbers:** A 2017-18 survey showing increased poverty was discarded by the government, and no further surveys have been released since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:12">[43:12]</a>.
*   **Census delays:** The census due in 2021 has been postponed indefinitely, contributing to a lack of reliable [[demographic_changes_and_their_economic_implications | demographic data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:43">[43:43]</a>.
*   **GDP metrics:** While India is often touted as the fastest-growing economy, this claim is based on extrapolating from bounce-back periods after sharp declines, with the average growth since mid-2019 being around 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:49">[44:49]</a>. This "data fog" is maintained because it allows for manipulation and narrative control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:07">[46:07]</a>.

Alongside data manipulation, there is a significant erosion of press freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:25">[40:25]</a>. Critical articles can lead to journalists facing investigations for tax or legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:30">[40:30]</a>. While some digital publications are more open, the mainstream media largely adheres to the official narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:49">[52:49]</a>. Independent voices face continuous scrutiny and potential consequences, leading to self-censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:31">[53:31]</a>.

## Implications for Global Relations and Future Prospects
The perception that India is a strong economy and democracy is, according to Modi, a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:38">[55:38]</a>. The V-Dem Institute categorized India as an "electoral autocracy" in their 2023 report, reflecting the state's use of coercive power and restricted freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:07">[56:07]</a>.

Given the existing "bad equilibrium," where corruption and criminality are entrenched, specific policy measures are unlikely to succeed if the system remains unaccountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:20">[57:20]</a>. The path to improving [[current_and_future_societal_changes | India's prospects]] lies in rebuilding social norms and public accountability, starting with a renewed emphasis on local democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:22">[58:22]</a>. This local engagement can build trust and cooperation, which might then filter up to address systemic issues in health, education, the judiciary, and [[environmental_and_urban_development_issues_in_india | environmental policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:04">[59:04]</a>. Without such fundamental changes, India's economic and political future remains bleak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:45">[59:45]</a>.

The world is experiencing an increasing degree of fragmentation, both internationally and domestically, particularly within the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This shift marks a reversal of several decades of convergence and [[Impact of Globalization Versus Localization | globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

## Drivers of Fragmentation

A primary driver of this fragmentation is a growing divergence in basic values and tenets among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This phenomenon is evident on multiple levels:

*   **International Disunity** Nation-states are increasingly prioritizing distinct national interests that lead to conflict, such as Russia's perceived need for Ukraine for safety or China's desire to unify Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Domestic Polarization** In the U.S., contentious issues have led to extreme polarization, raising questions about fundamental rights and societal management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>. This internal divide creates a significant risk of social disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Impact on the Global System

The emerging fragmented world is characterized by several critical changes:

### Reversal of Economic Integration

Historically, major economies became more synchronized due to [[Impact of Globalization Versus Localization | globalization]], increased trade, integrated [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | supply chains]], and open capital accounts, leading to co-moving bond yields globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. However, this trend is now reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>.

*   **Geopolitical Axes** A new axis appears to be developing between nations like Russia, China, the Middle East, and India, distinct from the Western world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:58">[01:12:58]</a>. This alignment will have real impacts on the free flow of commodities and [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | supply chains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
*   **Divergent Economic Conditions** As a result, economic conditions are expected to become more divergent, meaning demand shocks in one region, like the U.S., may not easily transmit globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. This contributes to [[Economic Implications of Deglobalization and Energy Policies | economic challenges of deglobalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.

### Monetary Policy Divergence

Monetary policy is also experiencing greater divergences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>. While much of the global central banking community is tightening policy, the Bank of Japan, for example, is not, causing significant fissures in currency markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>.

### Systemic Fragility

The current system, designed for efficiency rather than resilience, is becoming increasingly fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. This lack of resilience, coupled with a breakdown in information feedback mechanisms, means the system is unable to effectively correct itself, further cementing its fracturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Emerging Risks and Consequences

The confluence of these trends points to several significant risks:

*   **Social Disorder** Extreme polarization in societies, where a significant portion of the population questions institutional legitimacy, could lead to widespread social disorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.
*   **Global Distress** The breakdown of globally connected [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | supply chains]] for energy and minerals could lead to tremendous distress, including very high prices and potential starvation in poorer countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>.
*   **Political Risk** Increased political risk is observed at both the sovereign and individual levels, exemplified by instances where government disagreement can lead to asset freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>. This raises questions about what truly constitutes a "safe asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:09">[01:55:09]</a>.

Ultimately, the coming years are expected to be "tremendously interesting and tremendously eventful," suggesting a "bull market for volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>. The shift from a system designed for efficiency to one struggling with resilience could lead to widespread distress and a reshaping of [[Global Macroeconomic Trends | global macroeconomic trends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>.

From: [[toptradersunplugged]] <br/> 

The market capitalization of [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]] is estimated to be around $8 to $10 trillion, based on existing above-ground [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]] and its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In contrast, [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin's]] market cap fluctuates between $100 and $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Current Market Standing

*   **[[gold_market_dynamics | Gold]]:** Considered a large-cap store of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]]:** Presently a small market cap asset with very low investor allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is viewed as a "smaller cap speculative store of value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Despite its current size, it is not considered "hard to see" [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] eventually reaching a $1 trillion market cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. While not a prediction, this potential outcome would not be "utterly shocked" if it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Investment Framework

The speaker's investment framework involves refining views through conversations with experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, focusing on how the world economy and [[global_capital_flows_and_their_effects_on_asset_markets | global markets]] operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. They prioritize understanding the experiences, processes, and historical events that influence market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

An expert view on current [[comparison_of_current_economic_conditions_to_past_economic_cycles | global macro]] conditions suggests that the world is "bumping into the high point of two very long term cycles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>:
1.  The long-term debt cycle in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, which has accumulated debt over decades, leading to a much larger deleveraging event every 50 to 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, similar to the 1920s-1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
2.  The current [[significance_of_the_us_dollar_in_global_markets | global monetary framework]] that is "dollar centric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The world has largely outgrown this system, but remains constrained by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Scarcity and Digital Assets

[[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] is fundamentally scarce, with a fixed supply of 21 million coins and no inflation built into its algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. This scarcity is a key feature distinguishing it from traditional fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Precious metals, like [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]], are also scarce elements, with a limited number of types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>.

However, a notable difference between [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] and [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]] is that while [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] itself is scarce, the number of cryptocurrencies is not; anyone can create a new cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. This factor raised concerns about dilution of value across the cryptocurrency market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>. Despite this, [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] has unique strengths, including its decentralized and inherently scarce nature, unlike potential central bank digital currencies which would not be scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Its well-designed protocol, including halving events and difficulty adjustments, contributes to its uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

## Tail Risks and Investment Outlook

A potential risk for [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] is government attempts to ban or disallow it, which could relegate it to a black market item rather than a broad asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. Historically, during the 1930s, the US made possession of [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]] mostly illegal, but many people simply held onto it, making it an unenforcable policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:28">[00:46:28]</a>. Given [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin's]] encrypted and decentralized nature, it could similarly go "underground" if banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. Additionally, since it's mined and traded globally, not every country would necessarily ban it, providing resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:12">[00:47:12]</a>.

From an investment perspective, given its small market cap relative to [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]], a 1% allocation to [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] is seen as having defined downside (potentially zero) but undefined upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. The speaker turned "firmly bullish" on [[role_of_bitcoin_and_government_control | Bitcoin]] in early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>. While not giving a specific price target for [[gold_market_dynamics | gold]], the expectation is for it to reach over $3,000 by the end of the decade as a lower-end target, possibly doubling its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. There are "tail scenarios" where it could go much higher, especially if momentum investors get involved or if there's a more rapid [[gold_and_currency_dynamics | currency devaluation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>.

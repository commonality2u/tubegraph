[[Diversification in investment strategies | Diversification]] is considered the "only free lunch in finance" for trading systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:49">[00:45:49]</a>. Expanding the number of markets traded, especially in futures, can enhance performance.

## Number of Markets and Asset Classes
The speaker's personal trading system, which is fully automated, trades approximately 40 futures markets spread across all main asset classes and geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>. The system requires very little time per marketâ€”about five minutes per month per market, thanks to automated filters for bad prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

There are about 150 truly liquid futures markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If sufficient capital were available, the speaker would trade all of them because even adding a few basis points from the last market is worth the minimal time investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Capacity vs. Diversification Benefits
While adding more capital enables trading more markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>, there's a discussion regarding whether additional markets always provide [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | diversification benefit]] or if they are primarily for increasing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

Theoretically, there is always a benefit to adding another market, unless it is 100% correlated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. The crucial consideration is the cost associated with including that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. Even a tiny fraction of portfolio addition or a few basis points in performance can be valuable if operational and back-office costs do not exceed that gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.

### Strategies Across Markets
The speaker concluded that there isn't sufficient evidence to suggest that different systems work significantly better in different asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. While some exceptions exist, such as quick [[importance_of_diversification_in_trend_following | trend following]] not performing as well in equity indices as in other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a>, statistically rigorous analysis often doesn't show a significant difference for running distinct systems for different markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

A simple approach involves running the same system across all markets, adjusting for expected trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>. For example, faster trading might occur in cheaper markets like Nasdaq or S&P 500 compared to more expensive markets like Australian interest rate futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

## Personal Trading System Components
The speaker's personal trading system incorporates several strategies:
*   **Trend Following**: About 40% of the system is dedicated to [[importance_of_diversification_in_trend_following | trend following]], using a few different, though highly correlated, methods to add variety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.
*   **Carry System**: A significant portion focuses on a carry system, which analyzes the slope of the yield curve, roll arm, and contango in both yields and commodities across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24">[00:49:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Short Volatility Bias**: A systematic short bias is maintained on two volatility index markets (VIX and V2X) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:53">[00:50:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>. This strategy, though highly risky (with four times the skew of equity markets), is allocated a small portion of the overall risk (5-10%) because the [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_trading_systems | diversification]] from trend following and carry strategies helps mitigate concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:37">[00:51:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:54">[00:51:54]</a>.

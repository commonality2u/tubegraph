[[Correlation and diversification strategies in hedge funds|Correlation and diversification]] are crucial concepts in investment portfolios, particularly for strategies like trend following. The effectiveness of a portfolio system generally depends on the [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] and [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios|diversification]] across markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Historical Trends in Correlation

Historically, [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlations]] across Futures markets have shown significant shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>:
*   Before 2008, [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlations]] were generally low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   In 2008, [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlations]] "shot through the roof" and remained high until late 2013 or early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Impact on Trend Following Strategies

For [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio|portfolio construction]], the returns of trend following strategies are driven by market divergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. In a Sharp Ratio context, [[portfolio_diversification_and_risk_management|diversification]] and risk are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   Proper [[diversification_and_portfolio_management|diversification]] in a portfolio depends not only on low volatility but also on low [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] across assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   High [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] implies low [[portfolio_diversification_and_risk_management|diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This means that even if trends exist, high [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] increases risk because it creates a "one-trade world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   Periods of high [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] (like 2008-2013) have coincided with difficult performance for trend following strategies because there wasn't enough [[diversification_and_portfolio_management|diversification]] across their portfolios to support historical performance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Combined with price range compression, high [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] significantly decreased the ability of trend followers to capture divergent moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   With [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlations]] coming down in recent times, trend following strategies have started to bounce back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Evaluating Managers

When analyzing a manager, [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] analysis, especially conditional [[correlation_and_diversification_strategies_in_hedge_funds|correlation]] analysis, is considered very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

## Diversification Decisions

There are pros and cons to being more or less [[diversification_in_investment_strategies|diversified]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.
*   A larger, well-[[diversification_and_portfolio_management|diversified]] CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) with many different strategies tends to be more robust over time by mixing convergent and divergent approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   A pure trend following portfolio represents a pure divergent play, which can be a good complement to a very convergent, value-oriented, and traditional portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   The optimal level of [[diversification_and_portfolio_management|diversification]] depends on the investor's existing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Some investors may benefit from a pure trend following strategy, while others might benefit from a more [[diversification_and_portfolio_management|diversified]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   More resources are generally needed for a [[global_investing_and_the_importance_of_diversification|diversified]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

## Risk Management and Diversification

[[Portfolio Diversification and Risk Management|Risk management]] is considered the "greatest asset of the CTA industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. It is the value added by a manager beyond merely implementing a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. Even with perfect market knowledge, managing risk is crucial to prevent being "completely wiped out" due to price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Proper [[portfolio_diversification_and_risk_management|risk management]] can dramatically improve the Sharp Ratio and reduce drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

### Hidden vs. Unhidden Risks

A distinction is made between unhidden and hidden risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>:
*   **Unhidden risks** are those that appear directly in price movements, such as price risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>. Trend following strategies, which primarily expose investors to price risk, tend to have many small drawdowns because they lack other hidden risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   **Hidden risks** do not appear in price but can inflate Sharp Ratios and lead to large, infrequent drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Liquidity risk:** Does not show up until it materializes and is hard to measure beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. Futures markets generally tend to have less liquidity risk compared to other derivative markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
    *   **Credit risk:** Difficult to estimate and can appear as shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. Credit risk is not typically an issue for Futures-based strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
    *   **Leverage:** While often transparent, leverage can embed risk through dynamic leveraging, where positions grow or risk accelerates. An example is increasing bets when losing, which can create cyclicality in leverage application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Option strategies, for instance, apply dynamic leveraging (Delta increases as a function of P&L), leading to increased leverage with position growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. Trend following strategies typically do not engage in this type of dynamic leveraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Benchmarking and Style Analysis

Benchmarking in the CTA industry is challenging because of the high dispersion of returns among different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. To address this, a framework for style analysis is proposed using a "pure Divergent risk-taking strategy" as a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. This basic system can be adjusted by "tweaks" or factors to analyze individual managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>:
*   **Size Factor:** Accounts for market capacity constraints and allocates risk based on market size and liquidity. This factor indicates the value added by including smaller markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>.
*   **Equity Bias:** Measures the impact of adding long-minus-short positions or cash equities to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.
*   **Trading Speed:** Compares slower trading approaches to faster ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.

These factors can help determine how a manager's strategy fits within the overall structure and explain differences in performance among peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>. For example, in 2013, the size factor was very negative, indicating that bigger markets outperformed smaller ones, which helped explain why some managers performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>.

Investors often desire complexity from their trading managers, believing that extensive research necessarily leads to better systems. However, this pursuit of complexity can paradoxically weaken [[Systematic trading strategies | systematic trading strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Over-Optimization and Complexity

A common misconception is that adding numerous features or variables to a system will improve it. In reality, such additions, especially those designed to prevent drawdowns or only capture the "best" trades, often lead to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This approach tends to:
*   **Lessen the sample size** of trades, making the system less statistically reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Weaken the system's overall robustness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Reduce the system's ability to make significant profits** by cutting profitable trends short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

The objective should not be to completely eliminate drawdowns or achieve an excessively high winning percentage (e.g., above the low 40s), as these characteristics are often indicative of a less robust [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Traders should instead aim for "good enough" systems, rather than striving for theoretical perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.

## Strategies for Robust System Improvement

### Focus on Core Principles and Sample Size
The foundation of a robust [[Systematic trading strategies | systematic trading strategy]] lies in a large sample size of trades. When evaluating a [[Systematic trading strategies | systematic trader]], investors should inquire about their trade sample size and how it is calculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This involves:
*   Conducting 20-30 year backtests across various markets and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   Totaling thousands of trades to analyze their performance consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Instead of trying to eliminate drawdowns or "nice-ify" a system, the emphasis should be on developing a [[Simplicity in trading strategies | simple]], philosophical approach that has proven itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.

### Maintain Discipline and Consistency
Maintaining 100% consistency and discipline in executing systems is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:45">[02:46:45]</a>. This requires:
*   **Commitment to the process**: Sticking to a game plan even during difficult periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.
*   **Computerized execution**: Relying on computer-generated trades and a division of duties (system design vs. execution) to ensure a disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of losses**: Understanding that losing trades and drawdowns are an inherent part of a winning system and should not be eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. As Richard Dennis taught, it's better to lose money following the system than to make money by breaking its rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.

### Embrace Diversification
[[Diversification and risk management in trading systems | Diversification]] across numerous markets is crucial regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Trading all markets in the same systematic way allows for the accumulation of the necessary sample size for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. While markets can be highly correlated during drawdowns, diversification significantly mitigates their severity compared to undiversified portfolios (e.g., only trading stocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:03">[02:34:03]</a>.

### Differentiate Between Risk and Volatility
It's important to distinguish between risking capital and experiencing volatility in open trade profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:03">[02:24:03]</a>. While traders should be conservative about risking initial capital, they should be more liberal with open profits, allowing systems to ride trends without prematurely tightening stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:08">[02:47:08]</a>. Shortening profits through excessive adjustments (like tightening stops based on profit rather than trend) can lead to bigger losses and less overall profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:51">[02:47:51]</a>.

### Adapt to Market Changes, but Stick to the Core Philosophy
Markets constantly change, becoming more choppy and less smoothly trending due to increased participation and computer usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:15">[01:19:15]</a>. This necessitates a longer-term [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]] approach with more tolerant exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. Using multiple entries and exits, all with a longer-term focus, helps stay in trends even when markets are choppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>. However, the core philosophy of following price, taking small losses, being diversified, and letting profits run remains constant and is superior to trying to predict market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:05">[03:06:05]</a>.

### Avoid Common Pitfalls
*   **Excessive leverage, high fees, and commissions**: These practices historically hurt the managed futures industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.
*   **Solely trading diversified portfolios**: CTAs should offer stock-only funds to cater to investor preferences and demonstrate the applicability of [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following]] to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing managed futures solely as a diversifier**: Strategies should be valuable investments on their own merit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.
*   **Seeking external approval**: A trader must be true to their own systematic approach rather than being swayed by others or market fads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:53">[00:55:53]</a>.

By adhering to these principles, traders can improve their [[Evolution of Trading Systems and Strategies | trading systems]] and ensure robustness without falling into the trap of [[Overfitting and strategy robustness in trading | over-optimization]], ultimately providing a more reliable path to long-term success.

The [[2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath|2008 global financial crisis]] (GFC) served as the "catalyst" for the current "Fourth Turning" in history, a period characterized by exceptional upheaval and conflict [02:56:00].

### Definition of a Catalyst
A catalyst in historical cycles is a significant event that discredits existing institutions and their ability to provide security to their populations [03:06:00], [03:09:00]. This leads to an initial period of extreme loss of trust and demoralization within society [03:21:00], [03:26:00].

### Historical Precedents
Financial crashes have frequently been related to the timing of previous Fourth Turnings:
*   **Black Thursday (October 1929)** The Great Crash of 1929, which was a global event, acted as a catalyst for the last Fourth Turning, leading to the Great Depression and World War II [02:58:00], [03:09:00], [03:12:00], [03:15:00].
*   **Crash of 1857** This event had a notable relationship with Abraham Lincoln's election, turning states like Pennsylvania towards a Republican candidate favoring state intervention in the economy [03:35:00], [03:40:00].
*   **London Crash of 1772** This crash, caused by a famine in India, led to efforts to bail out the East India Company by cutting the price of tea imported to the American colonies, which eventually contributed to the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution [03:11:00], [03:19:00], [03:24:00].

### Impact of the GFC
The [[2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath|GFC]] marked the transition from the "third turning" (the fall season or "unraveling"), which was characterized by strong individualism and weak institutions, to the current Fourth Turning [03:12:00], [03:14:00], [03:22:00], [03:25:00]. Before the crisis, the prevailing motif was the "end of history," where markets and individualism were believed to have spread globally, and governments were expected to fade away [03:31:00], [03:40:00]. The GFC shattered this illusion, causing society to question the effectiveness of its institutions.

The crisis prompted a "regeneracy," a phase where people move beyond initial shock and distrust to realign themselves into larger groups [03:45:00], [03:51:00]. In the U.S., this was notably seen in the 2016 election, which ushered in a long-term shift towards populism within the Republican Party and increased political polarization [03:47:00], [03:54:00], [03:56:00]. This polarization is so intense that people are geographically sorting themselves into communities based on political views, and avoiding relationships with those holding opposing views [03:57:00], [04:00:00], [04:02:00], [04:07:00], [04:12:00].

Unlike the Baby Boomer generation, who were "cavalier about risk-taking," the Millennial generation, coming of age during this Fourth Turning, craves order and social guarantees [03:51:00], [03:59:00], [04:14:00]. They prioritize collective security, evident in their investment behaviors like flocking to target-date funds, where they prefer to "go down with their peers" rather than being left behind [04:41:00], [04:46:00], [04:48:00], [05:05:00], [05:11:00], [05:12:00], [05:14:00], [05:16:00].

The [[2008 global financial crisis and its aftermath|GFC]] and subsequent events highlight the cyclical nature of history, where apparent linear projections are often disrupted by sudden, unexpected shifts [02:58:00], [03:00:00], [03:03:00], [03:07:00], [03:09:00], [03:13:00], [03:16:00], [03:19:00], [03:22:00], [03:25:00]. This particular crisis initiated a period that will likely be characterized by increasing volatility in markets and greater governmental control and marshalling of resources, including private assets, to address emerging conflicts [05:55:00], [05:58:00], [09:51:00]. A significant outcome of a successful Fourth Turning is a move towards greater equality, often driven by the devaluation or redistribution of assets [09:56:00], [09:59:00], [10:02:00].

AHL, a firm that has profoundly influenced the world of rule-based investing and inspired countless firms, was founded by Michael Adam, David Harding, and Marty Lewis, who are considered pioneers of [[history and evolution of trading programs | systemic trading]] and [[history and evolution of trading programs | trend following strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Michael Adam and Marty Lewis are also co-founders of Aspect Capital, while David Harding founded and is CEO of Winton Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Genesis: From Oxford to Family Business

The story of AHL's origins begins with Michael Adam, who dropped out of Oxford University without a degree and, for lack of other options, began working in his family's brokerage business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The family firm's specific franchise was selling the Mauritian sugar crop on the London market, a detail that later became relevant due to Man Group's historic connection to sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Michael initially performed manual tasks like bookkeeping and drawing charts by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Driven by "laziness," he automated his job when a computer arrived in the office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. He created a database to draw charts by computer on a flatbed plotter and an accounting package for bookkeeping, marking the beginning of his interest in computer programming and its applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Marty Lewis, who managed to graduate from Oxford, joined Michael, compelled by the opportunity to do "fun coding" rather than a traditional banking job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. He had learned programming during summer holidays at university while working for a Department of Defense contractor in Washington D.C. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### First Forays into Trading

Michael's father played a crucial role in initiating their trading venture, suggesting they "see if there's anything in these technical trading models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. They refined a model based on the only data available at the time: physical commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Their first portfolio, funded with 25,000 pounds from Michael's father, traded six markets: cocoa, coffee, sugar, and three base metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## The Arrival of David Harding

David Harding, a Cambridge graduate, met Michael and Marty while he was working for Sabre Fund Management, then the biggest futures trading CTA in the UK with $4.5 million under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Before Sabre, he had started on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and worked for a commodity broker, where he had to draw hundreds of charts by hand daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This tedious task gave him significant time to reflect on chart patterns and develop an interest in systematic trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

David had read extensively on technical analysis and quantitative methods, holding a strong belief that markets were not efficient and could be forecasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. He was particularly impressed by Michael and Marty's advanced software, which was well ahead of what was seen in most banks and institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. He envisioned them testing his ideas, but soon realized they had many good ideas of their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. A striking moment for David was seeing their computer-generated buy and sell signals on charts, which closely matched the patterns he had learned from technical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## A Scientific and Empirical Approach

The combination of science and finance was uncommon at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. While scientists were increasingly recruited into the financial industry from the early 1980s, most were drawn to the orthodoxy of efficient market theory and stochastic calculus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. In contrast, Michael, Marty, and David, all trained as physicists (Michael had some physics training), were empiricists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Their software enabled them to conduct experiments, fostering an inquisitive mindset that distinguished them from many US-based managed futures managers of that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. They constantly sought to refine their models, add new markets, and increase trading speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Early Discoveries and Technological Edge

The advent of affordable, relatively powerful Hewlett-Packard computers was crucial, allowing them to run complex experiments that others couldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. They continually sought new, more powerful machines to reduce experiment run times, from 36 hours to one hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Their work, particularly their ability to produce heat maps and 3D graphs with color on early personal computers, was seen as "magic" by others in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

Key early discoveries included:
*   **Time-varying volatility and normalization**: Michael discovered a normalization technique using an exponential schema for assessing risk and normalizing markets, which is now a widely used regulatory standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.
*   **Trend-following as market making**: Through consulting work for Guild market makers, they discovered that trend-following trading strategies could model market makers' P&L with high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. This insight highlighted the importance of market access costs, leading AHL to obsessively measure and reduce execution costs from sampling to execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. This drive eventually led them to set up their own trading desk and interact directly with the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Founding AHL: The Startup Years

In February 1987, Michael, Marty, and David split from the Adam family business to form AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. They started with a modest 100,000 pounds in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. At the time, Michael and Marty were considering starting a computer consultancy, but David, confident in the value of their software and ideas, urged them to pursue the investment management business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

They "hustled" by taking on consulting projects, which inadvertently provided valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. For example, research on option replication was later recycled for guaranteed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. They operated on a shoestring, using Michael's father's office space and promising future payment to early team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### Challenges and Cultural Context

Starting a business as three people in their mid-twenties was unusual at the time, without the supportive culture seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>. Most of their friends were pursuing "fancy jobs in big institutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. The founders felt "unemployable" and were doing what was perceived as a "crazy thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

A significant challenge was recruiting talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. They couldn't afford experienced banking or trading professionals, nor would older individuals likely want to work for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. This forced them to recruit "raw talent"—new, young graduates—and train them from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. This turned out to be an advantage, as experienced hires often had to "unlearn" destructive and inappropriate habits from traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## Entry into the Managed Futures Industry

David Harding had prior exposure to the US [[managed_futures_industry_history | managed futures industry]], attending a conference hosted by Mort Baratz in 1985 or 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. At the time, it was a tiny industry, often met with "ridicule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. The Economist, in AHL's first year, published an article claiming they were "doomed to fail" because markets were efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. [[Evolution of Systems Trading | Systematic trading]] was considered a "heresy" and part of the "lunatic fringe" alongside practices like astrological chart predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

However, the late 1980s and early 1990s saw a simultaneous global emergence of systematic approaches in finance, with firms like Renaissance Technologies and Citadel applying computer simulation to financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>. The founders believe the prevalence of this work in commodities stemmed from their market structures becoming a template for other highly liquid markets, such as Treasury bond futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. With their ability to normalize data, AHL could immediately add new financial futures markets to their portfolio, realizing diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.

## Acquisition by Man Group

In 1989, the Man Group decided to acquire a part of AHL, purchasing 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. This decision was influenced by Man Group's successful existing relationship with Mint (Matthews and Ullman), another systemic trading firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Man Group sought to avoid a deadlock, as they had a 50% stake in Mint, and aimed to digest and control the investment management half of AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.

AHL's motivations for the sale were primarily **distribution** (access to Man Group's money-raising machine) and **market access** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. As an outsider, AHL struggled to get cost-effective market access, a problem Man Group could solve due to its existing market connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>.

This acquisition, however, created tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. Man Group's brokerage division was accustomed to a lucrative arrangement with Mint, where orders were faxed and executed at leisure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. AHL, focused on reducing time between sample and execution and lowering costs per round turn to trade faster and exploit tiny edges, constantly pushed against the brokerage's natural instincts for secure, profitable order flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. This drive made AHL "extremely unpopular with the brokers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

Five years later, Man Group acquired the remaining part of AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:57">[00:41:57]</a>. While the founders had conversations about building something that would outlast them, they didn't necessarily expect the firm to become such an institution that it would still carry their names years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. Michael Adam, in particular, was surprised by its long-term success, always feeling that the edge they had found might be taken away and that the firm had a very limited life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:38">[00:43:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>.

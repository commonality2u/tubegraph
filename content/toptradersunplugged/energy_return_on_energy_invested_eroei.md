Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) is a concept in energy economics that measures the ratio of usable energy delivered from an energy system to the energy consumed to obtain, process, and deliver that energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>. The basic intuition is that producing energy requires energy, and EROEI quantifies how efficient different energy sources are at generating energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:14">[01:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

## Historical Context of EROEI

Human history and evolution can be studied through the lens of being able to harness energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. For much of human history, until around 1650 AD, people primarily consumed energy in the form of food (for humans and animals) and wood for heat and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:42">[01:16:42]</a>. During this period, the EROEI was typically between 5 and 10 to 1 at the energy source level, or closer to 5 to 1 societally, accounting for all energy inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

With such low EROEI, there was almost no surplus energy left over after providing for subsistence and creating more energy for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This lack of surplus energy meant no ability to grow surplus capital or expand the economy, leading to a period of almost zero growth in real GDP, population, and energy consumption for about 16 centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>.

### The Shift to Coal

Around 1650, the UK, having run out of trees, was forced to move to burning coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>. Coal offered a significantly higher EROEI compared to wood, initially around 15 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:09">[02:11:09]</a>. This difference created free surplus capital, which led to an explosion in growth rates for population, real GDP, and energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:32">[02:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The ability to dewater coal mines using early steam-powered pumps, a direct application of this surplus energy, further increased energy availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:36">[02:37:36]</a>.

### The Age of Fossil Fuels

In the late 19th century, the harnessing of fossil fuels like oil and natural gas led to even greater efficiency. Today, traditional fossil fuel hydrocarbons have an EROEI of about 30 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. This high EROEI has enabled the modern world, drastically increasing energy consumption and driving economic growth by a factor of 20 compared to previous periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:47">[02:22:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:06">[02:23:06]</a>.

## EROEI of Renewable Energy

While fossil fuels emit carbon, a concern for climate change, the proposed [[challenges_of_renewable_energy | solutions]] involving renewable energy sources like wind and solar have a significantly lower EROEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:06">[02:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.

For wind and solar, the EROEI is drastically reduced when considering the entire system, including:
*   **Utilization Rate**: The dispatching power of a wind turbine can vary from less than 10% to 35-40% depending on location, with the average fleet at 15-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:07">[02:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
*   **Intermittency**: Wind and solar are intermittent (the sun doesn't always shine, and the wind doesn't always blow), requiring backup systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:47">[02:06:47]</a>.
*   **Redundancy**: The cheapest way to deal with short-term variability is to build huge redundancies, such as two windmills instead of one, placed far apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:12">[02:08:12]</a>.
*   **Battery Backup**: Batteries (e.g., lithium-ion) are needed to manage day-night variations, but they are very energy-intensive to mine materials for and manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:54">[02:14:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:55">[02:16:55]</a>. Almost half the energy consumed by an electric vehicle over its life is embedded in the battery itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:07">[02:17:07]</a>.
*   **Seasonal Variability**: No current battery solution adequately addresses seasonal patterns (winter vs. summer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:46">[02:18:46]</a>.

When these factors are accounted for, the EROEI for wind drops to between 5 and 10 to 1, and for solar, it falls to between 1 and 5 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:19">[02:28:19]</a>. This low EROEI means there is little surplus energy available for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, which could lead to a significant decline in quality of life and limited economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Misconceptions about Cost Reduction

There is a misconception that wind and solar costs will continue to fall indefinitely, similar to Moore's Law, or follow a "learning curve" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:11">[02:59:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:05">[03:00:05]</a>. While the levelized cost of electricity for wind and solar units has fallen significantly (75-80% in the last decade) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:11">[03:30:11]</a>, this trend is unlikely to continue because it begins to violate laws of physics and chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:53">[03:09:53]</a>. For example, lithium-ion batteries have a raw material cost of approximately $100 per kilowatt-hour, making it physically difficult to achieve a target of $100 per kilowatt-hour for the finished battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:46">[03:31:46]</a>.

The historical cost reduction in wind and solar was primarily driven by:
*   The lowest cost of capital in 4,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:24">[03:30:24]</a>.
*   A 90% fall in the price of all forms of energy from peak to trough over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:30">[03:30:30]</a>.

Windmills and solar panels require significant capital and energy for their manufacturing processes (e.g., tons of steel, cement, carbon fiber) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:58">[03:39:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:07">[03:40:07]</a>. For instance, ten 100-meter-tall windmills yield the same usable energy as one Permian shale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:48">[03:48:48]</a>. The prevailing belief that falling oil and gas prices have been a headwind for wind and solar is incorrect; instead, cheap energy and capital actually facilitated their cost reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:37">[03:55:37]</a>. Now, with rising energy prices and capital costs, the manufacturing of these assets is becoming more expensive, leading to write-offs of wind and solar assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:54">[03:55:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:26">[03:58:26]</a>. This highlights a [[sustainability_and_challenges_in_renewable_energy_investments | significant challenge]] for the [[challenges_of_renewable_energy | renewables sector]].

This situation indicates a [[current_energy_crisis_origins_and_impacts | full-blown energy crisis]] where companies do not have the latitude to invest in traditional energy assets due to [[impact_of_esg_policies_on_energy_investment | ESG pressures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:51">[03:50:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:51">[03:54:51]</a>. The [[economic_implications_of_deglobalization_and_energy_policies | malinvestment]] of capital and energy into inefficient technologies contributes to this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:52">[03:37:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:08">[03:40:08]</a>.

## Nuclear Power: A High EROEI Solution

Nuclear power stands out as an energy source with an exceptionally high EROEI and no carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:22">[04:13:22]</a>. For one unit of energy invested, nuclear power yields 100 units of energy out, significantly higher than fossil fuels' 30 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:58">[04:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:42">[04:14:42]</a>.

Despite concerns about nuclear waste (which is manageable and addressable, especially with new small modular reactor designs) and historical cost overruns, nuclear power is gaining renewed attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Nuclear power is extremely safe by any metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:17">[04:16:17]</a>. Europe has added it to its green taxonomy, and countries like France, the UK, China, and India are pursuing ambitious new nuclear programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:20">[04:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:25">[04:24:25]</a>. If embraced, nuclear power could lead to a step change in energy efficiency, comparable to the shift from wood to coal in 1650, potentially ushering in a period of great prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:55">[04:29:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:08">[04:33:08]</a>. This represents a promising avenue for [[role_of_renewable_energy_in_the_energy_crisis | addressing the energy crisis]].

## EROEI and Economic Growth Thresholds

Historically, when energy expenditures exceed about 10% of Western GDP, it acts as a significant drag on economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. At $150 per barrel of oil, the economy would likely slow down because too much of the economic system's productive energy is directed towards simply making its own fuel, causing it to "stall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>. This highlights the importance of EROEI for sustained [[potential_economic_growth_in_emerging_markets | economic growth]].

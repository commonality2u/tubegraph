Marty Luuk, co-founder and Director of Research at Aspect Capital, describes the journey of building successful quantitative investment businesses like AHL and Aspect Capital. This process involved careful team formation, the establishment of a strong culture, and a continuous focus on research and adaptation.

## Genesis and Early Team Formation
Marty Luuk co-founded AHL in the mid-1980s, an endeavor he describes as a "happy accident" [00:06:49]. His journey into quantitative investment began when his Oxford University friend, Michael Adam, whose family business was in physical commodities, was encouraged by his father to investigate technical trading models [00:07:38]. Michael, a year ahead of Marty at Oxford, taught himself to program in Pascal on a rare personal computer in 1983 [00:07:43].

Marty joined Michael at Rockem Securities, Michael's father's small broking house, after leaving Nomura in 1984 [00:08:26]. Together, they investigated various trading strategies, distilling them into fundamental rules [00:08:36]. Their first systematic portfolio managed Â£25,000 of Adam family money across six commodity markets [00:08:48].

They later met David Harding, a Cambridge graduate working at Sabre Fund Management [00:09:11]. David was an understudy to Robin Edwards, a chartist fund manager who used chart patterns to determine trading decisions [00:09:34]. Marty, Michael, and David realized they could encode Robin's rule set into a systematic approach [01:09:08]. This meeting of minds led to David joining the Adam family business [01:10:20], and eventually, AHL was founded in February 1987 after Michael and his father had a difference of opinion [01:10:42].

At AHL, the three founders, whom Marty refers to as "three nerds," approached model development like a scientific experiment [01:12:28]. They used historical data and models to continuously improve their strategies, adding markets and refining components [01:12:30]. This scientific approach became a defining "DNA" for the industry, contrasting with the more rule-set-based approaches of early US CTA firms [01:12:52].

## Evolution and Institutionalization with Aspect Capital
After Man Group's IPO in 1994, Marty, Michael, and David went their separate ways [01:27:10]. Marty left Man Group at the end of 1995 after spending a year dismantling much of AHL's research and technology teams [01:28:17]. He then co-founded Aspect Capital with Anthony Todd and Eugene Lambert, both former AHL colleagues, in 1997 [01:28:25]. Michael Adam was a shareholder and backer in Aspect but not an executive [01:33:51].

The vision for Aspect was to take the managed futures business developed at AHL and Man and bring it to an institutional audience [01:28:39]. They believed that statistical models had broad applicability and that managed futures, with its liquidity, directional agnosticism, and diversification benefits, should be an integral part of a balanced portfolio [01:37:00]. The goal was to establish a business that was institutional in outlook, setup, and fees, with a high level of transparency, in contrast to the opaque, high-fee retail-focused structured products prevalent at the time [01:34:49].

## Building and Managing the Team at Aspect Capital
Aspect Capital was built from the ground up to attract institutions, emphasizing thoroughness [01:40:34]. They did not manage client money until they had enough staff for a 24-hour trading operation and a disaster recovery facility [01:40:43]. While some software is outsourced, much of the operational infrastructure is handled in-house [01:41:09].

The organization currently has around 120 people, with 70 focused on research, trading, and supporting technology [01:42:11]. The research process and team structure have evolved significantly [01:41:34]:
*   **Division of Labor**: The team moved from everyone doing everything to a structured division of labor, avoiding silos by asset class [01:41:44].
*   **Specialized Teams**: Key teams include technical production, software development (supporting production and research), a core research team, a dedicated [[evaluating_hedge_fund_performance | risk management]] and risk review team, and a product management group [01:42:26]. The product management group acts as an interface between clients and the research team, allowing researchers to focus on their core job [01:42:51].
*   **Technology Team**: Supports data and provides tools for exploring new areas [01:43:05].

## Hiring Philosophy and Culture
When adding new members, Marty emphasizes that "the cultural piece is more important than you might think" [01:43:52]. Aspect doesn't solely rely on graduate intake or "hoovering up PhDs willy-nilly" [01:44:27]. Instead, they target specific skill sets, such as a fantastic statistician or expertise in signal processing, often seeking skills "not far removed" from their core discipline [01:44:33].

For junior roles, while qualifications like PhDs in finance and programming skills are important, the most crucial attributes are "attitude and ... cultural fit" [01:45:40]. Marty refers to this as the "three C's: character, competence, and chemistry" [01:45:49].

Building a strong culture, especially in asset management which can lend itself to a "cult of the individual" [01:46:35], is critical. Marty notes that the transition from a top-down, character-led business to a genuinely academic, multidisciplinary, collegiate research effort is challenging but essential [01:47:02]. A successful trading system needs to evolve and be improved upon, and no single individual can corner the market [01:47:46]. The ability to build a team, trust, and delegate is essential for creating longevity in the program [01:48:08]. The sustained success of firms like AHL, Winton, and Aspect is a "tribute" to their research processes rather than the "genius of the individual model" [01:48:55].

Marty highlights the importance of choosing the right people and maintaining commitment within long-term partnerships, acknowledging that "it's about the people that you choose to work with and then it's it's about commitment" [01:50:38].

## Evolution of the Trading Program and Risk Management
The success of Aspect Capital's track record is a testament to the persistence of trend-following models across various economic scenarios [01:52:50], and the fact that it is an "evolving process" [01:53:07]. Marty compares their research process to pharmaceutical research: a continuous "pipeline of products" that evolve rather than relying on a single, static solution [01:54:08].

While changes are largely incremental, Marty points to two significant evolutions:
1.  **Importance of Risk Management and Portfolio Construction**: In the 1980s, the diversification offered by the range of markets meant that trend-following models "risk managed itself" [01:57:08]. However, as markets became more homogenous and correlations increased (e.g., with macro effects and the advent of VaR metrics), explicit [[challenges_and_considerations_in_hedge_fund_management | risk management]] and portfolio construction became paramount [01:57:29]. As portfolios become more complex, it's crucial to explicitly manage "edge cases" and [[hedge_fund_management_challenges | risk management]] challenges [01:59:38].
2.  **Transition to Analog Implementation (2004-2005)**: Initially, AHL and early Aspect models were based on binary breakout models that traded in discrete, large chunks, leading to significant market impact and visibility to brokers [01:07:01]. Around 2004-2005, a transition to an "analog implementation" allowed for smoother, effectively invisible entry and exit points in markets, which was crucial as markets became more disintermediated (e.g., in FX) and other market participants began to understand their models [01:09:08]. This change was a direct response to mitigating market impact and avoiding being "picked off" by other traders [01:09:04].

The current low-volatility environment and its impact on performance are constantly investigated to ensure that the strategy isn't self-sabotaging and that market dynamics haven't fundamentally changed [01:00:50]. Marty draws comfort from having lived through similar periods of "doldrums" before, such as after the 1987 crash, reinforcing his confidence in the ability of systematic models to adapt to changing market environments [01:01:31]. He stresses that their systemic approach is "not scenario specific," allowing models to adapt to whatever the markets present [01:03:49].

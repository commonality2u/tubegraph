Marty Lueck, co-founder and Director of Research at Aspect Capital, is a well-known figure in the alternative investment industry. He was also a co-founder of [[history_and_origins_of_ahl | AHL]] in the mid-1980s, a firm that has become the root of many successful European investment managers [02:07:09]. Aspect Capital embarked on a mission to democratize the managed futures industry, providing access to successful quantitative strategies without expensive structures or guarantees [01:40:40].

## Early Beginnings and the Founding of AHL

Marty Lueck studied physics at Oxford [00:06:55]. His friend, Michael Adam, also from Oxford, took a year off and began working for his father in the family's physical commodities business [00:07:16]. In 1983, Michael's father, Cyril Adam, encouraged him to explore technical trading models [00:07:38]. Michael taught himself Pascal on a Hewlett-Packard 9816 [00:07:50].

Marty joined Rochem Securities, Michael's father's small broking house, in January 1984, after leaving a job at Nomura [00:08:02]. Together, they investigated a wide range of trading strategies and distilled them into fundamental rules [00:08:32]. Their first systematic portfolio managed 25,000 pounds of Adam family money across six commodity markets: cocoa, coffee, sugar, aluminum, copper, and zinc [00:08:48].

During this period, they met David Harding, a Cambridge graduate who was working at Sabre Fund Management [00:09:11]. David was an understudy to Robin Edwards, a chartist fund manager [00:09:34]. Edwards' trading decisions were based on chart patterns, which David would meticulously update [00:09:41]. Marty, Michael, and David realized that if they could encode Robin's rule set, it "would be something" [00:10:14]. David eventually joined the Adam family business [00:10:31].

In early 1987, due to differences in business direction between Michael and his father, Marty, Michael, and David left to found AHL [00:10:38]. They started with one client and $100,000 of investor money [00:10:48]. AHL was officially set up in February 1987 [00:11:02]. Initially, they operated out of borrowed office space, including Marty's father's office and a "cupboard at the back of the Sabre office" [00:11:10]. Sabre Fund Management even took an early stake in AHL [00:11:18].

The co-founders of AHL approached model development like a scientific experiment, using historical data and distilling models to essential characteristics [00:12:28]. They sought to improve models, add markets, and test different parameters, rather than looking over their shoulders at others [00:12:39]. This scientific method became a significant feature of the industry's evolution [00:21:37].

Early AHL models were primarily breakout models that would scale into positions based on repeated patterns [00:18:27]. While they admitted to making "schoolboy errors" like over-optimization, the scaling-in feature of their models made them "reasonably robust" [00:18:57]. They started incorporating moving averages into their program in the late 1980s or early 1990s [00:20:07].

Marty Lueck initially pursued a career in quantitative investment research because he was "happy accidently" drawn into it, rather than a conscious determination to get rich [00:29:44]. He credits Michael's father for suggesting the idea [00:30:07]. A trading game they developed, where they analyzed random market data without emotion, helped them realize the potential for systematic trading by removing noise and focusing on price information [00:30:20].

## Partnership with Man Group and AHL's Evolution

AHL began a [[Partnership with Man Group | partnership with Man Group]] after Marty Lueck provided consulting services to Man's commodity division [00:23:02]. Man Group, through its joint venture with Mint, a pioneering systematic CTA, had already achieved significant success, managing over a billion dollars by the end of the 1980s through structured products and global distribution [00:13:25]. Mint's success meant they were at capacity [00:23:50].

In 1989, Man Group acquired a stake in AHL [00:23:32]. At the time, AHL had $30 million under management [00:24:46]. Man Group encouraged AHL to focus solely on the development of the AHL program, halting the commercialization of their software and consulting business [00:24:21]. By 1994, when Man Group bought out the remaining minorities and IPO'd, AHL managed $300 million [00:25:01].

A key difference between AHL and Mint/Man Group was AHL's strong commitment to a research effort [00:25:51]. While Mint's business was successful with only 24 people in New Jersey, AHL had over 70 people in London, including large trading, research, and technology teams [00:26:07]. Man Group initially questioned the need for such extensive research and technology [00:26:20]. However, in the mid-1990s, Mint funds "struggled," while AHL's research-driven approach began to "deliver on the research promise" [00:26:41].

## The Founding of Aspect Capital

After the Man Group IPO in late 1994, Michael Adam, David Harding, and Marty Lueck went their separate ways [00:27:10]. Michael left to start a software venture capital firm [00:27:17]. David Harding formed a separate research team within Man Group, which ultimately led to the genesis of Winton Capital Management [00:33:02]. Marty stayed on to manage AHL through a "depressing year" in 1995, dismantling much of the research and technology team [00:27:42]. He decided to leave at the end of that year [00:28:17].

After a year and a half break, Marty Lueck co-founded Aspect Capital with Anthony Todd and Eugene Lambert [00:28:23]. Both Todd and Lambert had previously worked at AHL [00:28:29]. Michael Adam also became a shareholder and backer of Aspect, though not an executive in the early years [00:33:51].

The core vision for Aspect Capital was to democratize the managed futures business developed at AHL and Man, and bring it to an institutional audience [02:50:53 | 00:34:42]. The managed futures industry at the time, particularly the Mint and AHL programs within Man, was predominantly a retail business, often delivered through opaque, high-fee structured products [00:34:13]. Institutional investors often turned their noses at this "scruffier industry" compared to quantitative equity or statistical arbitrage models [00:38:04]. Aspect aimed to establish a business that was "institutional in outlook, in set up, in fees" [00:34:58].

[[Building and growing a boutique investment firm | Building and growing Aspect Capital]] involved initially aspiring to be a quantitative multi-strategy firm, even developing a quant equity business [00:39:22]. However, after the "trauma of 2008," they closed that business [00:39:37]. Today, Aspect Capital operates as a single-product, predominantly [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | trend-following business]] [00:39:48].

## Aspect Capital's Structure and Evolution of Strategy

Aspect Capital manages its operations largely in-house, believing that to attract institutional clients, a thorough, self-built infrastructure is necessary, including a 24-hour trading operation and disaster recovery [00:40:30]. While they outsource some software, much of their operational infrastructure is handled internally [00:41:09].

The firm's organization includes around 120 people, with 70 focused on research, trading, and technology [00:42:11]. The research team, in particular, has evolved from a state where "everyone did everything" to one with a division of labor, including:
*   Technical production [00:42:26]
*   Software development (supporting production and research systems) [00:42:29]
*   A core research team [00:42:36]
*   A dedicated risk management and risk review team [00:42:39]
*   A product management group that interfaces with clients and protects the research team's focus [00:42:49]
*   A technology team that supports data and tools for new research areas [00:43:05]

Marty Lueck emphasizes the importance of cultural fit and attitude when hiring, noting that the "cultural piece is more important than you might think" [00:43:52]. While they do make targeted hires for specific skills, such as a statistician [00:44:33], they do not simply "hoover up PhDs willy-nilly" [00:44:27].

A strong organizational culture is built by transitioning from a "top-down character lead" approach to a "genuinely academic, multidisciplinary, collegiate research effort" [00:47:02]. This transition is crucial because even a "terrific trading system on day one" will need to evolve and improve [00:47:41]. Marty believes "no individual is able to corner the market" and that building a robust, trusting team is essential for longevity [00:48:00]. The persistence and evolution of businesses like AHL, Winton, and Aspect are a "real tribute" to their shared research process, rather than the "genius of the individual model" [00:48:33].

### Key Changes in Strategy

The [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic and trend-following investment approaches]] at Aspect have undergone significant evolution. Marty highlights two major developments:

1.  **Importance of Risk Management and Portfolio Construction**: In the 1980s, the wide range of available markets provided sufficient diversification, meaning the combination of trend-following models across sectors "risk managed itself" [00:56:56]. However, as markets became more homogenous and investors' portfolios globally began to look similar, correlations increased [00:57:43]. This led to a greater "propensity for shock effects" [00:58:31]. In response, Aspect and the industry began to seek new sources of diversification, not just across markets but also timescales and models [00:58:38]. Explicitly dealing with "edge cases" in risk management became "super important" as the portfolio became more complex [00:59:34].

2.  **Transition to Analogue Trend Capture Models (2004-2005)**: Early AHL and Aspect models were "binary models" across various timescales, meaning positions would change in "discrete chunks" [01:07:01]. By 2004, Aspect's size and good performance meant their trading flow was "noticeable" and could be "picked off" by market participants, especially in disintermediated FX markets [01:07:57]. To address this "market impact" and visibility, Aspect transitioned to an "analogue implementation" of trend capture models [01:09:08]. This new approach captured the same market effects but allowed for much smoother and "effectively invisible" entry and exit to the markets [01:09:17].

Marty reflects on periods of underperformance, noting parallels between the current environment and the doldrums experienced by AHL after the 1987 crash, which lasted until 1993 or 1994 [01:01:40]. He draws comfort from having lived through such periods, emphasizing that [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic models]] can adapt to changing market conditions because they are not "scenario specific" [01:03:52]. He also points to the "price range compression" in recent years as a visual explanation for why momentum strategies might struggle [01:04:22]. Despite recent challenges, many long-term trend-following strategies, including Aspect's, have returned to all-time highs [01:05:08].

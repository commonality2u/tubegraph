[[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | Trend following]] is a core commitment for Aspect Capital, focusing predominantly on medium-term [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] to deliver returns to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The firm maintains this commitment even during challenging periods for [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]], resisting the temptation to introduce other models or change weights based on past or perceived future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategy

Initially, Aspect Capital experienced significant market impact due to its visibility in trades, leading to being "picked off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This led to a substantial focus on execution to make entries and exits smoother and effectively "invisible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The approach shifted to dribbling trades into markets in random pieces and at random delays, exploiting market volatility rather than forcing immediate execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Composition

Aspect Capital's portfolio is structured as follows:
*   **80%** focused on [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
    *   They trade over 150 markets, encompassing approximately 180 to 200 instruments with multiple contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **20%** dedicated to complementary or modulating models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. These models are designed to:
    *   Smooth out the "rough edges" of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
    *   Take advantage of orthogonal or diversifying effects with similar persistence as the momentum component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
    *   Capture other factors, which may include relative momentum between instruments, carry effects (in FX, fixed income, or equities), and dynamics of the term structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
    *   Some of these are faster strategies, including mean-reverting or other market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   The firm continually evolves and improves the core [[trend_following_basics | trend following]] component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Construction and Risk Management

The starting point for portfolio construction is an agnostic outlook, seeking broad diversification across seven sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This diversification is adjusted based on:
*   Long-term structural correlations between markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   Liquidity characteristics of markets, including hard limits from exchanges and conservative internal constraints on average daily volume or open interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   This systematic process regularly determines portfolio allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

The firm has substantial capacity for growth within its existing framework, carefully monitoring how changes in the program impact correlation structure and market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. They are also cognizant of broader market conditions and their potential to dry up, irrespective of their own size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

## Execution and Liquidity Management

The firm primarily uses electronic execution (around 96% box-to-box), which is monitored 24 hours a day by an experienced trading team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. They have "circuit breakers" or thresholds that indicate sporadic changes in liquidity profiles, to which the portfolio construction will adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

While they do not engage in high-frequency trading (HFT), they employ a suite of execution algorithms that are regularly parameterized based on market characteristics like bid-offer spreads and typical clip sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>. These algorithms aim to obfuscate their activities and capture a "patient premium" by not being in a hurry to execute trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

## Position Sizing and Risk Management in Trend Following

Position sizing in [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following]] is a function of both signal strength/conviction and perceived market risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. If market volatility (a proxy for risk) doubles, the position size is halved to maintain the same risk for a given signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.

The process is not an inexorable line where a stronger trend always leads to a bigger position; there's a point to "back off" and potentially become a liquidity provider rather than consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. There is no hard stop-loss; position sizes gradually modulate as signal strength changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.

### Model Risk and Oversight

Model risk is addressed through a rigorous review process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. A dedicated risk team, as experienced as the researchers, critically evaluates all new components and improvements, whether to [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]], modulating strategies, execution algorithms, or portfolio construction methodologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>. This includes using out-of-sample data, synthetic data, and examining failure cases to stress components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.

Furthermore, the risk team reviews the holistic release of the program, assessing how all pieces work together to ensure the overall dynamics are robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. The aim is to avoid situations where, in past market conditions (e.g., 1994, 2005, 2009), the portfolio would have become too concentrated to manage without discretionary intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:10:00">[58:10:00]</a>. This ensures that the models themselves incorporate necessary constraints and appropriate admixture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:50:00">[58:50:00]</a>.

## Investor Understanding and Drawdowns

Despite the complexity, medium-term [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] has intuitive qualities for institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. If one follows global financial news, they can broadly understand why a [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]] portfolio makes or loses money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. The concept of buying when something goes up and selling when it goes down is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.

Investors sometimes struggle with the emotions of drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:33:00">[30:33:00]</a>. It's crucial for clients to understand the role of managed futures as a diversifying constituent in their portfolio, providing low correlation to equities and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>. While not anti-correlated, this low correlation means it will behave differently from mainstream assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:00">[34:07:00]</a>.

Every strategy experiences drawdowns, and losing confidence in [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | trend following]] during such periods goes against the principle that no single factor works all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>. Sticking with a strategy that provides utility to the portfolio is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>. Managers should focus on explaining *why* they do what they do, rather than just *how* or *what*, to build investor belief and comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities

The fund management industry, including managed futures, is experiencing an evolution characterized by fee pressure and a demand for "pure factor" delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>. While some view this as a negative, it's seen as a natural evolution that also brings opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:41:00">[48:41:00]</a>. Products, once complex and expensive, are becoming more accessible, leading to the "democratization" of the managed futures industry and a potential broader place in institutional and retail model portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:16:00">[49:16:00]</a>.

A potential risk is that smaller firms struggle and are forced out, leading to a concentration of assets among a few large managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>. However, a return of performance for [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] could provide opportunities for smaller firms and new entrants, fostering continued development in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Managers

*   **Be true to yourself**: If you are a passionate discretionary trader, hone those skills rather than forcing a systematic approach, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:19:00">[56:19:00]</a>.
*   **Systematic vs. Discretionary**: If a manager claims to be mostly systematic with a "discretionary overlay," they are 100% discretionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:32:00">[57:32:00]</a>. True systematic approaches must embed responses to extreme events directly into the models, ensuring their integrity and the usefulness of backtests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:50:00">[57:50:00]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach**: Successful management is a holistic challenge, combining various pieces (models, markets, risk management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. Managers should be able to articulate how they integrate components, manage risk, and continuously evolve their program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:38:00">[54:38:00]</a>.
*   **Teamwork and Continuous Learning**: Recognize the value of team chemistry and relying on talented people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Maintain a "childlike enthusiasm and energy" to explore new information and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:46:00">[42:46:00]</a>.

The future of systematic trading is less about the "genius of the trader" and more about the repeatability, robustness, thoroughness, and extensibility of the approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:53">[01:05:53]</a>. It plays into a model portfolio view where systematic trading is a key component alongside other strategies, emphasizing reliability and evolutionary improvement over personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

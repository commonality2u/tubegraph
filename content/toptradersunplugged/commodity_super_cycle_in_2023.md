A new global macro order is emerging, characterized by a significant natural resource shift. This article delves into the perspectives of Jeff Currie, Head of Commodity Research at Goldman Sachs, on the current [[commodity_super_cycles | commodity super cycle]], its unique characteristics, and the outlook for 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:52">[01:33:52]</a>.

## Jeff Currie's Background
Jeff Currie serves as the Head of Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58">[02:58]</a>. His entry into the commodity space was influenced by the first Gulf War in 1990, where oil prices at $40 a barrel led him to his first job in the oil market before completing his PhD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18">[03:18]</a>. His doctoral dissertation focused on the geographic extent of the oil market, noting oil as the largest, most global, and fungible market in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>.

## Unique Characteristics of the Current Commodity Cycle
The current inflationary period, particularly the [[commodity_markets_and_economic_impacts | interplay between commodities and inflation]], is distinct from previous periods like 2008 or the 1970s primarily due to the intense focus on decarbonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15">[05:15]</a>.

### Impact of Decarbonization
The emphasis on decarbonization makes it challenging for the commodity sector to generate a typical supply response under current pricing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>. Publicly traded commodity companies often prioritize share buybacks with their cash flow over new drilling, despite economic incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47">[05:47]</a>. This trend affects all commodities, not just oil, as the "old economy" (which creates 80% of global emissions) is seen as "dirty" compared to the "clean" new economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07">[06:07]</a>. Consequently, capital attraction to the commodity space has been severely constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>.

This limited ability to achieve a supply response is the single most distinguishing factor of the current cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37">[07:37]</a>. A preferred solution would be to implement a carbon price or tax, as it avoids distortions in investment and prevents higher prices than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53">[07:53]</a>.

### Drivers of Commodity Inflation
Jeff Currie posits that commodity bull markets and inflation are ultimately created by low-income groups, not high-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>. This is because commodities are volumetric markets, driven by the quantity consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06">[10:06]</a>. High-income groups, who control dollars in financial markets, cannot control the sheer volume of physical goods necessary to drive commodity inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25">[11:25]</a>. Hoarding commodities like corn or oil is numerically impossible for a small segment of high-income individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50">[12:50]</a>. The only commodity high-income individuals could potentially hoard is [[gold_and_commodity_cycles | gold]], due to its high density and easy storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58">[12:58]</a>.

Historically, commodity bull markets have been driven by low-income groups. Examples include:
*   The 2000s China story, fueled by 400 million low-income rural Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10">[15:10]</a>.
*   The 1970s commodity story, driven by the War on Poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19">[15:19]</a>.

Current policy responses, such as windfall profit taxes in Europe, which redistribute returns to lower-income groups, inadvertently worsen supply problems while accentuating demand issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42">[14:42]</a>.

## Commodity Outlook for 2023

### Demand Side Dynamics
The biggest drag on commodities in the second half of 2022 stemmed from the demand side, particularly from China, the world's largest commodity consumer and oil importer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42">[17:42]</a>.

*   **China's Rebound:** China has abandoned its zero-COVID policy, and indicators like mobility, subway ridership, and holiday bookings are sequentially turning up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46">[18:46]</a>. A "big golden week" holiday is anticipated, further reinforcing oil demand recovery by potentially 1.2 to 1.5 million barrels per day over the next six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28">[19:28]</a>. Stimulus focused on the property market and a shift back to growth will make commodities the best play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50">[19:50]</a>.
*   **Europe's Reprieve:** Europe experienced an energy-induced slowdown in late 2022, but a mild winter and adjustments have eased the immediate energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27">[20:27]</a>. PMIs in Europe and India are rebounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56">[20:56]</a>.
*   **United States:** The US has digested 425 basis points of rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10">[21:10]</a>. As the market becomes more comfortable with terminal rates, there is potential for upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24">[21:24]</a>.

The commodity sector has largely priced in a recession, yet there is little evidence of one globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38">[21:38]</a>. Physical suppliers and inventories are positioned for a recession in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58">[21:58]</a>. The question remains: what happens if a global recession doesn't occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06">[22:06]</a>?

### Supply-Side Challenges and Investment
Despite recent outperformance, the commodity space remains "unloved" and underinvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:09">[24:09]</a>.
*   **Outflows:** The sector saw $60 billion in outflows last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12">[24:12]</a>. Hedge funds dedicated to commodities are significantly fewer than in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16">[24:16]</a>.
*   **Equity Valuation:** Commodity equities are undervalued, with high free cash flow yields, indicating a lack of belief in the sector's long-term story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40">[24:40]</a>. Energy's market cap in the S&P 500 is 5-5.3%, but its revenue share is closer to 9-10%, reflecting underinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51">[24:51]</a>.
*   **Historical Losses:** The sector has a history of epic losses, with E&P companies destroying 54 cents on every dollar given to them over the last decade, and commodities themselves generating a 60% loss over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54">[25:54]</a>.
*   **Track Record Needed:** Investors typically require a three-year track record. Commodities posted 42% returns in 2021 and 26% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24">[26:24]</a>. Another strong year in 2024 might be needed for significant rotation to occur, potentially taking another 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38">[26:38]</a>. This pattern mirrors the "Revenge of the Old Economy" concept seen after the dot-com bust in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55">[26:55]</a>.

## Specific Commodity Markets

### Oil Market
*   **Russian Supply:** Since the December 5th price cap implementation, Russian oil flows are down 200,000-300,000 barrels per day due to frictions, but this is not catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06">[29:06]</a>. The bigger problem is expected in February with refined products, as they are less fungible than crude oil and logistical issues could lead to another 600,000 barrels per day loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00">[30:00]</a>.
*   **OPEC's Power:** OPEC's (specifically core OPEC such as Saudi Arabia and UAE) market power has never been higher since its inception in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01">[33:01]</a>. They are the only major producers with reinvestment rates at or above 2019 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48">[31:48]</a>. The "game's over" for long-term investments in deepwater offshore platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07">[32:07]</a>. The only three engines of growth going forward are fast-cycle production from US Shale, the Middle East, and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19">[32:19]</a>. With Russia constrained and US Shale limited by capital attraction, the Middle East is the primary engine of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:31">[32:31]</a>. OPEC's credibility with global investors is also very high, and they have adhered to their announced production cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:17">[36:17]</a>.
*   **Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR):** The US stopped selling from its SPR in December 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45">[33:45]</a>. The loss of up to a million barrels per day from the SPR, coupled with gaining over a million barrels per day of Chinese demand and losing 500,000-600,000 barrels per day of Russian supply, creates a huge shift in balances, leading to an upside for oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50">[33:50]</a>. The SPR is unlikely to be used in 2023, possibly being held for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11">[34:11]</a>.
*   **Monetary Policy Impact:** A stronger dollar and higher interest rates were significant drivers of oil price declines in H2 2022, effectively reducing the money available to chase oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:38">[38:38]</a>. OPEC's November 2022 production cut was historic as they preempted a demand loss, which was previously impossible due to cheating and higher supply elasticities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27">[39:27]</a>.

### Metals
*   **Aluminum:** Aluminum is expected to be one of the most bullish commodities over the next 5-10 years, driven more by China than Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:35">[40:35]</a>. The "climate paradox" of aluminum is that it requires significant emissions to produce but is critical for solving climate change as a "green metal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48">[40:48]</a>. Supply curtailments in Europe (due to energy crisis) and China (export tariffs to keep energy domestic) contribute to this bullish outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:02">[41:02]</a>.
*   **Titanium & Rare Earths:** Russia holds large market shares in smaller, rare earth-type metals like titanium, platinum, and palladium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30">[43:30]</a>. These can be used to create significant problems for the West if Russia chooses to, as they have huge market share in these critical, tiny markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40">[43:40]</a>.

### Natural Gas (Europe)
Europe consumes about 45 BCF per day of gas, with Russia historically supplying 15 BCF (one-third) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01">[45:01]</a>. Europe lost about 10 BCF of Russian gas, replacing 4 BCF with LNG and 1 BCF with coal switching, leaving a shortfall of 5 BCF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:17">[45:17]</a>.
*   **Near-Term Relief:** Warm weather and China's demand weakness have allowed Europe to manage the mismatch by bidding away LNG from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:44">[45:44]</a>.
*   **Future Challenges:** The problem re-emerges if China rebounds and a cold winter occurs in late 2023 or 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51">[45:51]</a>. The gas problem is global, except for the US east of the Rockies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16">[46:16]</a>.
*   **LNG Limitations:** Europe's manufacturing sector, particularly in Germany, cannot operate sustainably off LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:42">[46:42]</a>. LNG is an emergency fuel, not a long-term solution, due to the high costs and infrastructure required for liquefaction, shipping, and regasification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15">[47:15]</a>. This suggests that industrial activities may need to relocate to regions with cheaper gas (like the US) or problems with Russia will eventually need resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:32">[47:32]</a>.

### Agriculture
Agricultural commodity prices, particularly for soybeans and corn, have rebounded to highs seen during the initial Russia-Ukraine conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50">[50:50]</a>. These remain among the tightest markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:13">[51:13]</a>. The driving factors are summarized as the "three C's":
1.  **Climate:** Changing yields due to weather shocks, especially in traditional breadbasket regions like the US Midwest or Brazil's Mato Grosso <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:39">[51:39]</a>. This may necessitate a shift in agriculture to more northern climates or areas with better yields, which will take time and create supply restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:07">[52:07]</a>.
2.  **Conflict:** Geopolitical conflicts, as seen with Ukraine, exacerbate food insecurity, particularly in vulnerable regions like Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:20">[52:20]</a>.
3.  **Carbon:** Underinvestment in carbon-related assets affects agriculture, as food is a carbohydrate (carbon-hydrogen bond) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:31">[52:31]</a>. This leads to the same underinvestment dynamic hitting the oil, metals, and mining sectors, creating a [[structural_changes_in_commodity_markets | structural bull market]] in agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33">[53:33]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in Commodities
The most asymmetric way to profit from the [[commodity_super_cycles | commodity super cycle]] over the next decade involves investments in equities within the space, as trillions of dollars of capital expenditure will be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>.
*   **Equities:** Owning commodity-related equities is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **Commodity Basket:** A basket of commodities can serve as an inflation hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.
*   **Uranium:** An excellent example of a commodity to own in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.
*   **Green Metals:** Metals and miners that enable the "Green Revolution" are important, specifically:
    *   Copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>
    *   Aluminum (Alley) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>
    *   Silver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:47">[01:00:47]</a>
    *   Nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>
    *   Lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>
    *   Cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>
    *   Rare earth metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>

If forced to choose one, oil is the most strategically important commodity, driving macro variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. The inability to stop investing in such a critical commodity, while consumption continues, will lead to a widening gap between supply and demand, creating significant [[volatility_in_commodity_markets | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:45">[01:01:45]</a>. This emphasizes the need for a carbon price or tax to curb consumption rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:39">[01:01:39]</a>.

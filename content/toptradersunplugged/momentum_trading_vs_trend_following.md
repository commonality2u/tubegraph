This article delves into the distinctions between momentum and [[Trend following as a trading strategy | trend following]] strategies, explores the broader concepts of convergent and divergent risk-taking, and discusses what constitutes a "pure trend" approach in investment. The discussion also includes a review of market themes from 2023 and an outlook for 2024, particularly concerning fixed income and commodities, all through the lens of systematic, algo-based investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

## Momentum vs. Trend Following

Historically, "momentum" in academic literature was synonymous with **cross-sectional momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This phenomenon, widely documented since Jagadesh and Titman in 1993, refers to persistence in the cross-section of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. It involves buying winners and selling losers with the expectation that relative outperformance will persist over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

[[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]], initially viewed with disdain by academics due to less available data in futures markets, made its debut around 2013 in papers titled **Time Series Momentum** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This approach looks for persistence in the time series, meaning an asset itself continues moving in the same directionâ€”like an object in motion remaining in motion until stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

In summary:
*   **Cross-sectional momentum** (or popularized "momentum") is about relative outperformance across assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Time series momentum** ([[Trend following as a trading strategy | trend following]]) is about following momentum in individual assets across a basket of assets to build a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

It is possible to combine these approaches, a concept known as **Dual Momentum**, as described by Gary Antonacci in his book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This involves looking for persistence in both individual assets and across assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While many [[Trend following trading strategies | trend following]] practitioners use absolute momentum, some employ [[Trend following strategies | trend following]] on a relative basis, such as in currencies, which are inherently cross-sectional assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Convergent vs. Divergent Strategies

This framework, highlighted by Mark Kinsky, helps understand the underlying philosophy or implicit belief in an investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Risk-taking is defined by beliefs, perspectives, and past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Convergent Risk-Taking
A **convergent** approach views the world as stable, somewhat dependable, and relying on symbiosis, often expecting an equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
*   **Behavior**: When convergent strategies win, they confirm their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. When they lose, they tend to "double down" because they believe the market will revert to their expected equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. They take profits when they think they are right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.
*   **Return Profile**: Lots of small wins, but occasionally large negative losses when they are fundamentally wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

### Divergent Risk-Taking
A **divergent** approach views the world as non-deterministic and random, accepting that unpredictable events can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. It's about accepting the unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Behavior**: When divergent strategies lose, they move on, understanding that the current trend is not materializing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. When they win, they continue to pursue the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
*   **Return Profile**: Lots of small losses, but occasionally very large wins when they capture an unexpected market movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> (e.g., the Yen trade in 2022). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>

[[Trend Following Investment Strategy | Trend following]] is a **divergent strategy** because it systematically cuts losses when things don't go in the direction of the trend and follows trends when they increase, regardless of a predefined belief system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This means it works well when the world is divergent and things change unexpectedly (e.g., Ukraine, COVID, inflation flux) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Conversely, in a convergent world (like 2023's consolidation period aiming for a "soft landing"), divergent strategies experience more false starts and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## The Concept of "Pure Trend"

"Pure trend" refers to a strategy where **conviction directly links to position sizing**, primarily by following market price moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. It uses price movements as the sole basis for position sizing, aiming to remain agnostic to external views or beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

Adding other signals, like a "carry" signal, or certain risk management approaches, can introduce "convergent beliefs" into the system, diluting the purely divergent nature of a [[Trend Following Basics | pure trend]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>. An example of this is **constant risk targeting**, where a trend signal is always scaled to a specific target volatility (e.g., 10% VaR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>. While seemingly prudent, this can paradoxically dial down positions when signals are strong and dial them up when signals are weak, thereby introducing a convergent element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>.

> "A purely divergent strategy would be a pure Trend strategy that doesn't incorporate any sort of more views-based assumptions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>

Historically, during crisis periods marked by unpredictability, [[Trend Following Basics | pure trend]] strategies have shown to be the best at reacting to changes, rather than predicting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. This "crisis alpha" characteristic makes pure trend strategies a crucial first line of defense when convergent views are challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. For instance, in 2022 and during COVID, [[Trend Following Basics | pure trend]] performed well by following strong trends like short energy and long bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.

While some risk management frameworks, like setting guardrails for diversification, do not inherently negate a divergent approach, extreme constant risk targeting can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

## 2023 Market Review

The year 2023 was challenging for [[Trend following and momentum strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.
*   **Rare Events**: The regional banking crisis (SVB) had a spectacularly large impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Inflation Trade**: The residual effects of the inflation trade continued to dissipate into new themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.
*   **Short Bond Positions**: Short bond positioning was profitable for parts of the year, contrary to common norms, before consolidating in Q4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>.
*   **Statistical Properties**:
    *   Fixed income volatility remained 50% higher than pre-2020 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
    *   Stock-bond correlations remained positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>, indicating a different regime than the "Great Moderation" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:29">[00:35:29]</a>.

Despite individual asset classes showing more than 50% positive days for [[Trend Following Basics | trend following]], the SG Trend index was down, largely due to specific difficult days like March 10th and 13th (the second and eleventh worst days since inception) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. Removing these two days would flip the index's performance from negative to positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

2023 was an outlier year compared to historical data, with lower Sharp ratios across various look-back periods beyond 100 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Performance correlation across different windows was also at a historical low, suggesting a turbulent year with significant consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>.

### Drawdown Recovery
Analysis of the SG Trend index shows that after large drawdowns (e.g., minus 10% to 15%), average forward returns tend to be slightly higher than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Conversely, after periods of very high returns (e.g., 25% to 30%), subsequent average returns are typically lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>. This aligns with the [[Trend Following Basics | trend following]] philosophy of cutting losses and waiting for the next big divergent market move after periods of consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

## Fixed Income Insights

A significant theme was the **nine quarters of net short signals for [[Trend following in various markets | trend following]] in fixed income**, one of the longest such runs in over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:11">[00:44:11]</a>.

The fixed income trade can be broken down into three phases:
1.  **Inversion and Rising Rate Cycle**: [[Trend following strategies | Trend signals]] tend to be short and perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.
2.  **Flattening Yield Curve**: [[Trend following strategies | Trend signals]] are still likely to be short but with more mixed performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
3.  **Stabilization or Steepening Yield Curve**: [[Trend following strategies | Trend signals]] are likely to shift to long positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

Empirical studies show these patterns persist over 40-50 years of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. Looking back to the 1960s, fixed income volatility was higher, and stock-bond correlation was positive, similar to the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:46:48]</a>. This suggests the current higher bond volatility may not be merely transitory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>.

While traditionally, shorting fixed income faced a "headwind" due to negative carry (having to provide the coupon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:41">[00:48:41]</a>, the drastic movements in bond prices (e.g., crashing values) have outweighed the negative carry, making short positions profitable during periods of significant price drops or inverted yield curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

The historically negative stock-bond correlation, particularly prominent from 2000 to 2019, is an outlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>. Investors should reconsider their portfolio allocations (e.g., 60/40) as bonds may no longer provide the same level of safety or negative correlation as previously assumed, given increased volatility and potentially positive stock-bond correlations in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.

## 2024 Outlook

The market outlook for 2024 suggests a **"bumpy landing"** scenario rather than a smooth "soft landing" or a harsh "hard landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>. There is an anticipation of more volatility in inflation and growth, leading to a wider range of outcomes than many anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. This means continued swings between optimism and pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.

**Commodities** currently show short [[Trend following strategies | trend signals]] on average, though there's a tug-of-war between geopolitical tensions and demand dissipation in the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. A potential rebound in commodities could signal a new cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. The ability of [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] to move across different asset classes provides a valuable opportunity set to capture trends wherever they occur, not being confined to only financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

Chesapeake Capital is an investment firm founded in 1988 by Jerry Parker, who also serves as its chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The firm's origins are directly tied to the renowned [[historical_evolution_and_strategy_changes_in_turtle_trading | Richard Dennis Turtle program]], from which Parker and other participants "scattered and went back to where we wanted to be" to start their own funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Early Formation and Growth

Chesapeake Capital began with a significant advantage due to its affiliation with the Turtle program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. People believed the track record from the program was legitimate, leveraging the reputation of Richard Dennis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. Parker recounts an anecdote where merely mentioning being one of the "Turtles" immediately opened doors for meetings on Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Early support came from firms like Kidder Peabody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

The executive team includes Mike Ivy, described as a "great researcher, computers and math guy," and Anil Ladd, who has been the head trader and president of compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. They have worked together for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

Chesapeake Capital was one of the first dedicated managed futures firms, gaining significant public fund money from major institutions like Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, and Prudential in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. A substantial commitment from Abu Dhabi also played a crucial role in supporting the managed futures industry for over two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. For many years, the firm managed billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Challenges and "Detours"

The firm faced challenges when mutual funds, particularly CTA mutual funds, emerged, leading to the decline of public fund investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Chesapeake Capital was "not very prepared for replenishing that asset base" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

Around 2006-2007, after a decade of consistent winning years, Chesapeake Capital experimented with deviations from its classic trend-following approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. These "detours" involved incorporating profit objectives, smoothing techniques, [[Evolution of Systems Trading | dynamic position sizing]], correlation management, and volatility management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. This was influenced by observations that "everyone else was doing it" and a desire to "get bigger and better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. However, within months, they observed performance "that we had never seen in the back test before," prompting them to revert to their "classic one entry, one exit, and a stop loss type trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. Parker noted that his role was often to restrain the research team from deviating from core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Strategic Evolution

Jerry Parker emphasizes his strict adherence to the "eternal truths" and "Ten Commandments" taught by Richard Dennis, even more so than Dennis himself or other Turtles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. While others felt more freedom to expand beyond pure trend following into broader [[Evolution of Systems Trading | systematic trading]], Parker remained "dedicated to the trend following" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

### Key Philosophical Pillars:
*   **Built-in Risk Management:** Trend following offers inherent risk management without sacrificing profit potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>.
*   **Embrace Difficulty:** Trading "should be hard," "difficult," "painful," and "annoying," as this often indicates being on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:30:00">[26:30:00]</a>.
*   **Sample Size:** The answer to "every trading question is something about sample size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Core Rules:** Take small losses, let profits run, massive diversification, one entry, one exit, and a stop loss are fundamental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.
*   **Volatility is not Capital Risk:** While used for initial position sizing, volatility on open trades does not directly represent capital risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:06:00">[36:06:00]</a>.
*   **Discipline:** Following the system 100% of the time, even if it's an "average system," can outperform a "better system" that is not strictly followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a>.
*   **Trade Small:** The most important rule to "stay in the game" is to avoid trading too large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. Trading too large can "impinge on your ability to follow the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.
*   **Disregard for Sharpe Ratio:** Parker argues that the Sharpe ratio "penalizes unfairly and inaccurately" for trend-following strategies due to their non-normal distribution, outliers, and positive skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>. It prevents letting profits run, a cornerstone of trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a>.
*   **Money Management:** Chesapeake Capital uses "closed trade equity" to size new trades, maintaining a fixed trade level for long periods (e.g., a year or more) before incorporating profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>. This contrasts with other CTA money management schemes that use current AUM, which can lead to rapid unwinding of positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

### Evolution in Strategy:
The most significant change in Chesapeake Capital's strategy was moving from a short-term (20-day) look-back period to a much longer one, now in the hundreds of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>. This shift, which Parker sometimes refers to as "Buy and Hold" in a managed futures context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>, was prompted by poor performance in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. By observing weekly charts, Parker noticed "big trends" lasting one to three years and tasked his research team with exploring longer look-back periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. Back-testing confirmed that longer-term approaches were "always better," not necessarily in terms of Sharpe ratio, but in terms of risking "one dollar to make three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>.

Chesapeake Capital maintains a diversified portfolio, embracing [[Investment strategies in a changing economic landscape | single stocks]] (making up half the portfolio with 150 stocks), and trading "as many commodities as we can, currencies, so many currencies and cross currencies, interest rates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. They are constantly seeking new markets, including ETFs, mortgage-backs, TIPS, corporate bonds, and Muni bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. This broad market diversification is crucial for their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Clients and Industry Views

Parker believes there is an inherent conflict between adhering to strict trend-following rules and satisfying investor preferences for smoothness and lower volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>. He argues that clients "will steer you wrong" and "pressure you to take those profits too quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>. He aims to offer clients "what you need versus what you want," substituting volatility control with consistency in annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:22:00">[37:22:00]</a>.

He is dismissive of strategies like "Trend following plus say long equities" or combining trend following with other systems, as he believes 90-95% of CTA returns are "totally due to Trend following" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:00:00">[47:00:00]</a>. He stresses that everything should be trend-followed with a stop loss and trailing stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:07:00">[51:07:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Jerry Parker is excited for the future of trend following, believing that the period of 2020-2022 is "just the beginning of getting back to sort of a normal situation" where diversified trend-following strategies will be superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:36">[01:07:36]</a>. He aims to see trend following "elevated to its proper position," as it "just keeps cooking and going right along" even when "famous hedge funds" experience "horrible periods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>. He feels people underestimate "how dangerous the world is and how crazy things can happen," positioning trend following as "one of the best solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:11">[01:08:11]</a>.

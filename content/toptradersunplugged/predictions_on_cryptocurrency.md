Mahendra Sharma, founder of Mahendra Prophecy Publications, offers specific forecasts for the cryptocurrency market based on his astrological and "wave of nature" theories. He views [[investment_strategies_and_market_predictions | investment strategies]] as requiring precise timing and understanding of market cycles to generate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

## Overall Outlook

Sharma does not recommend investing hard-earned money in Bitcoin currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. Instead, he suggests considering gold or stocks like Amazon for better returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. He predicts that the right time for significant investment in cryptocurrency will be from **2026 onwards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:33">[01:04:33]</a>. This is because he anticipates many central banks worldwide will launch their own cryptocurrencies around that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>.

## Bitcoin Specifics

Sharma notes that Bitcoin should not be sold or shorted at this stage, as it is currently very close to a high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. He outlines a critical period for Bitcoin:

> "It's very interesting date I think is something major we're going to happen on the 20th of February 2021 that will be there to watch I think uh in my astro cycle theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>... between 20th February and 27th February 2021. So that week is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>."

During this crucial week:
*   If Bitcoin fails to drop drastically, it could test price levels of $45,000 to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.
*   Conversely, if it does experience a drastic fall within this period, it will crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>.

He emphasizes that even with a volatile trend, Bitcoin can currently hold value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

Sharma foresees the period from 2027-2028 as the "right time" for cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. During this time, he believes it may become legalized or significant changes will occur within the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:37">[01:02:37]</a>. However, for the next six to seven years (from the time of recording), traders should remain cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>.

He contrasts the role of gold and cryptocurrency in the future, stating that gold can play a far more significant role than cryptocurrency, even before 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. This perspective highlights his long-term view where traditional assets like gold may maintain their importance despite the rise of new digital forms of value.

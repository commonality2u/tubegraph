Covenant Capital Management approaches market selection and [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | diversification]] with a clear philosophy rooted in systematic trading and cost efficiency.

## Systematic Approach and Market Variety
The systematic and mechanical approach to trading, favored by Covenant, is chosen partly because it is "much easier to apply to a wide variety of markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Scott Billington, co-founder of Covenant Capital Management, highlights the difficulty for a discretionary trader to be an expert in vastly different markets, such as the Yen and cotton, if using fundamental inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The firm applies the "exact same trading signals" across all its programs, with the only difference being position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Similarly, they run the "same model on all markets" with every input being identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>. This contrasts with approaches that use "63 different models," each tuned for specific markets like wheat or the S&P, which Billington considers "the ultimate height of curve fitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>.

## Market Categorization and Liquidity Constraints
Covenant categorizes CTAs and hedge funds into four types: boutiques, battleships, emerging, and experimental managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>. This categorization influences their views on market diversity and capacity:

*   **Battleships:** These are giant, well-established managers (e.g., North of $750 million to a billion dollars AUM with over a 10-year track record) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:20">[00:48:20]</a>. Their primary limitation is that the liquidity of various markets restricts them "to primarily financials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:45">[00:48:45]</a>. While they may have some commodity exposure, it's typically in aggregated groups (e.g., all grains) because "you just can't do a 15,000 lot and cocoa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Boutiques (Covenant's category):** With lower assets under management, boutiques like Covenant can maintain exposure to a wide variety of markets, long and short, that would not significantly impact the outcome for larger groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.

## The Advantage of Market Diversity
From a "scientifically" driven perspective, "the more times I can apply that edge the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. Therefore, "trading more markets is without question more desirable than trading fewer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>. This is based on the assumption that markets are "diversified enough" to provide more instances to apply a trading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:48">[01:19:48]</a>.

Scott uses an analogy: it would be "foolish" for a casino to close all its blackjack tables except for the one that had done the best in the last hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. This illustrates the folly of not diversifying across available opportunities.

### Short-Term vs. Long-Term Returns
While short-term sector outperformance might occur (e.g., stock indexes performing well for a few years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>, this is often attributed to "luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. Over longer periods (e.g., 10 years), the performance of different sectors, such as cotton and coffee versus the euro currency, tend to "cancel each other out," allowing "the real strategical differences" to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>.

Investors, however, frequently chase "whatever happened to have been hot in the last... 18 to 36 months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. This short-term focus leads them to sort managers by their recent performance, favoring those who "happen to specialize in that sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>, rather than evaluating the long-term strategic benefits of [[diversification_and_portfolio_management | diversified]] market exposure.

### Role of Short Trades in Diversification
Covenant's model initially eliminated short trades but later evolved to incorporate them again. Short trades have "proven to be the best [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | diversifier]] versus Longs" over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. Although Long trades are inherently better due to unbounded upside and compounding within the trade, short trades are a crucial "part of the portfolio" for their [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | diversification]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>. The firm has developed "tactics to minimize the weakness of short trades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:26">[01:03:26]</a>.

## Conclusion
Covenant's philosophy emphasizes a systematic, robust approach that can be universally applied across a wide range of markets to maximize the application of their trading edge. This commitment to [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | market diversity]], combined with a long-term perspective, aims to build a resilient and consistently profitable strategy, acknowledging that short-term performance often comes down to luck or specific sector exposure, which allocators tend to chase despite the long-term benefits of [[global_investing_and_the_importance_of_diversification | global investing and diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:51">[01:18:51]</a>.

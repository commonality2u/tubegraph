China plays a crucial, yet dependent, role in the global semiconductor supply chain. While serving as a major assembly hub for finished products, [[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]] remains significantly vulnerable due to its reliance on foreign technology for advanced chip design and manufacturing.

## China's Position in the Semiconductor Supply Chain

In a typical chip manufacturing process, the final assembly of chips into a product often takes place in [[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. However, this position highlights a key vulnerability: [[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]] is "utterly dependent" on firms primarily in the US or allied with the US for the foundational technology needed to produce these chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

## Historical Challenges and Technological Lag

The history of computing technology shows that the Soviet Union, despite its ability to produce early Cold War military technologies like nuclear weapons and long-range missiles, "completely failed" to produce the advanced weapon systems and computing components that defined military power by the end of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This struggle with miniaturizing computing power is evident even in recent conflicts, such as Russia's war in Syria (2015-present), where at least 80 percent of bombs dropped were unguided "dumb bombs," similar to those used in World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This historical example illustrates the ineffectiveness of a "copycat strategy" of stealing intellectual secrets as a sole basis for technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Key Vulnerabilities and [[Choke points in chip manufacturing and their significance | Choke Points]]

[[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]]'s semiconductor industry faces significant [[choke_points_in_chip_manufacturing_and_their_significance | vulnerabilities]]:

*   **Chip Design Software**: To design a chip with billions of transistors, specialized software is required, not manual drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This software allows for drawing schematics and modeling chip functionality before production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. Three major companies, all based in the US, design and produce this critical software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>. This provides the US with the ability to cut off foreign companies' access, making it "basically impossible" for them to design cutting-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.
*   **Advanced Manufacturing Equipment**: The most advanced chips rely on sophisticated lithography machines, such as those produced by ASML, a Dutch company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. ASML holds a 100% market share for these critical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, without which advanced chips cannot be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.
*   **Fabrication Facilities (Foundries)**: TSMC, a Taiwanese company, dominates the manufacturing of advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Over one-third of the new computing power added globally each year comes from chips produced by TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. This includes nearly all smartphones, easily a third of PCs, and many data center chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

## US Actions and Their Impact

The US has leveraged these [[choke_points_in_chip_manufacturing_and_their_significance | choke points]] as levers of power against [[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

### Jinhua (DRAM Chips)

Jinhua, a Chinese company, sought to enter the market for DRAM memory chips, dominated by three companies (two in South Korea, one in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Jinhua reportedly worked with former Micron (US firm) employees in Taiwan to acquire trade secrets to upgrade its production capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. The Chinese government accused Micron of intellectual property (IP) violation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>, complicating Micron's pushback given [[Chinas economic policies and market impact | China]]'s importance as a market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

Under the Trump administration, the US government, frustrated by the ongoing IP theft issues, took unprecedented action. It made it illegal to sell certain types of equipment to Jinhua <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>. Without this machinery, Jinhua could not produce advanced chips, effectively putting the company out of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>. This demonstrated the "visceral way" the US government could unilaterally impose a "death sentence" on a firm by restricting access to essential equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.

### Huawei (Telecom Equipment)

Huawei, a Chinese telecom equipment maker, gained popularity by providing good equipment at low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>. While the US raised concerns about sanctions violations and espionage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>, the primary issue was Huawei's growing size and deep integration into global telecom networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

Historically, countries controlling telecom infrastructure have used it for espionage and military purposes, as seen in World War I with British cutting off Germany's telegraph access and during the Cold War with KGB and NSA tapping telephone networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. The US concluded that if [[Chinas geopolitical moves and Taiwan | China]] was a [[USChina relations and geopolitical dynamics | geopolitical adversary]], Huawei would inevitably be used in the interest of the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>. This led to a strategy of blocking Huawei from US, Japanese, Australian, and many European cell phone networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:24">[00:46:24]</a>.

## [[USChina relations and geopolitical dynamics | Geopolitical Implications]]: Decoupling and the "Chip War"

The actions against Huawei suggest a broader trend: the West will not accept a Chinese firm integrated into its technology ecosystem in the same way as a Japanese or Korean firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>. This implies a future with "two in some sense fully separate" telecommunications and technology infrastructure systems, signaling a potential end to globalization in this sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.

The US is essentially telling [[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]]: "You're welcome to use our system, but we're not going to use your system" for critical technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:10">[00:47:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. Where [[Chinas economic trajectory and global influence | China]] has its own capabilities (like telecom equipment), the "inevitable result is two different systems" or a "decoupling" of the tech infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:36">[00:47:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. This dynamic contributes to the concept of a "Chip War," with serious potential for conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Mutually Assured Destruction in Economics
> The historical record suggests that deep economic integration does not always prevent conflict. Examples include Britain and Germany before World War I, and the US and Japan before World War II, where major trading partnerships rapidly dissolved into blockades at the outbreak of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>. More recently, Germany's strategy of deep economic integration with Russia did not yield the hoped-for results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:43">[00:50:43]</a>. This raises concerns that current interdependence may not be a stabilizing force but could lead to a more vulnerable position during a crisis, such as a conflict in the [[Chinas geopolitical moves and Taiwan | Taiwan Straits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:12">[00:51:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

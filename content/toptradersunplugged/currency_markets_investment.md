Chris Cruden, founder and CEO of Inch Capital Management, is a veteran in the alternative [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment business]] with a long career spanning firms like Dean Witter and AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. His company, Inch, specializes in currency markets, a choice that helps them stand out in a world often dominated by diversified managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Early Career and the Shift to Currencies

Cruden's career began as a British Army officer before he transitioned into finance as a gold analyst for a bank in South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. He then joined Dean Witter Reynolds in the U.S., which had a managed futures department led by Ken Tropin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. In the early days, "hedge funds" were not a common term; the industry was primarily "CTAs" (Commodity Trading Advisors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Dean Witter was highly successful, with one new offering oversubscribed by more than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

After the 1988 market crash, Cruden returned to London and joined AHL, a firm that later became a significant source of talent for European managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. At AHL, which started with $5 million under management, the focus was on replicating the success of firms like Mint by adding more markets and increasing diversification, becoming more systematized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Cruden was attracted to AHL's endeavor to become more systematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Mentorship and the Genesis of a Currency Focus
A significant influence on Cruden was Bob Tamiso, a "guiding light" and mentor, whom he joined in New York in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Tamiso, a highly systematic trader and a good friend of Larry Hite from Market Wizards, instilled in Cruden the importance of being "entirely systematic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The most crucial lesson learned from Tamiso was to "always show up," meaning to remain in business and avoid being forced out by excessive leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

Tamiso and Cruden held the opinion that markets were becoming too crowded as more people became registered CTAs, making them "over-leveraged" and "bad places to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This led them to seek an uncrowded market: the interbank foreign exchange market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Bob Tamiso famously stated that currency markets were "so big that we can't screw them up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. In contrast, they observed that when "quote-unquote funds" enter commodity markets like the London Metal Exchange (LME), they tend to upset the balance, making them less reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Their first currency program, "Kintyre" (named after a Scottish place), was launched and quickly became more successful than Tamiso's diversified commodity trading business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This program operated with extreme simplicity, with trading signals generated once a day and trades executed via phone and fax, highlighting that success doesn't require high-frequency trading or nanosecond systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

## Inch Capital Management and the Cantillo Program

In 2000, Cruden launched Inch Capital Management, which operates the Cantillo program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. The firm maintains a lean structure, with eight people in Lugano, Switzerland, and a small representative office in London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. Cruden prefers working with young people who haven't worked elsewhere to avoid preconceived notions about "how we used to do it at Merrill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. The firm's culture emphasizes self-management, with very low employee turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>.

### Track Record and Strategy
Inch presents its track record in two ways: a "pure alpha" number without fees or leverage, and a version net of two-and-twenty fees at three times leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. The three-to-one leverage is chosen because it yields a similar standard deviation to the S&P 500, but with substantially higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

The Cantillo program has not fundamentally changed over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. It is a systematic trend-following strategy focused on major currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. Initially trading 10 markets, it gradually expanded to 16, including Swissy crosses and Euro crosses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>.

The strategy is built on four main drivers for a currency system:
1.  [[the_carry_trade_and_interest_rates | Interest rate differential]] (the "carry trade") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>
2.  Momentum breakout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>
3.  Volatility trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>
4.  Purchasing power parity type programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>

Inch's system is primarily based on [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rate differential]] and breakout, with a 70/30 favoring interest rate differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:02">[00:55:02]</a>. Due to low [[impact_of_shortterm_interest_rates_on_investments | interest rates]] in recent years, returns from the carry trade have been limited, with gains primarily coming from interest rate differentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

The program aims to produce absolute returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. It has also shown a strong positive benefit when added to an equity portfolio, as its positive months tend to align with negative months in equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. Cruden suggests this may be because currency markets are primarily markets of capital flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.

### How the Program Works
The Cantillo program treats currency crosses as "rows of numbers" rather than countries, focusing on changing relationships in terms of volatilities or correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. All trades are risk-equivalent at the time of instigation, as they have "no idea what tomorrow's prices are going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>.

Key aspects of the strategy:
*   **Volatility as an Exit Signal:** An increase in [[impact_of_market_volatility_on_investment_returns | volatility]] tends to terminate a trend, while low [[impact_of_market_volatility_on_investment_returns | volatility]] tends to initiate one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Volatility is generally what triggers an exit from a trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.
*   **Low Leverage:** The program uses very low leverage, ranging from one-to-one to three-to-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. This is crucial for "showing up again tomorrow" and avoiding going broke, even in challenging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Systematic and Disciplined:** The system is "entirely systematic" and "entirely disciplined" to remove emotion (hope, greed, fear) and ego, which are seen as detrimental inputs for a trading strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   **Independent Algorithms:** Unlike older models, each of the 16 currency crosses in the Cantillo program has its own algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>. These algorithms are simple "sets of rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. The parameters, such as those measuring volatility, are set differently for each cross to maintain risk equivalency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:46">[01:01:46]</a>.

Cruden believes in simplicity, stating that excessive "cleverness" or complexity in [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment strategies]] can be unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.

### Market Environment and Outlook
For currency programs, the environment over the last five years has not been favorable, largely due to low [[impact_of_market_volatility_on_investment_returns | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. Despite this, Inch has performed well compared to peers, many of whom have faced "horrific and fatal periods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.

Cruden expects a return of volatility, which would be very positive for genuine trend followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. He compares the current period to 1990-1993, which was followed by a more volatile 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. He notes that [[impact_of_market_volatility_on_investment_returns | volatility]] tends to "jump" rather than rise slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>.

While acknowledging that authorities are using "new techniques," Cruden strongly believes that current [[global_economic_conditions_and_currency_trends | economic conditions]] created by these tools are unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. Central bank interventions in currency markets, such as those by Australia and Japan, have generally not been "particularly successful" over the long term, only slowing or briefly reversing a trend before it resumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. He anticipates the environment for currencies will become "very much more favorable, and very quickly" precisely *because* of the tools that have been used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

### Philosophy
Cruden emphasizes that their approach is about showing up daily and executing their system with discipline and patience at low leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. They do not claim to have "predictive or special insights" into [[investment_strategies_and_market_predictions | market predictions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>. He views the business as "extremely easy" because performance is quantifiable daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. While some managers focus on perceived "cleverness," Cruden advocates for simplicity and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.

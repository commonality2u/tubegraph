Top Traders Unplugged is a podcast dedicated to learning from top hedge fund managers to enhance investment careers and due diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The systematic investor series with Niels Kaastrup-Larsen and Katy Kaminsky provides insights into global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

It is crucial to remember that all discussions about investment performance pertain to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or infer future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. All investment strategies carry a significant risk of financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Investors should request and understand specific risks from investment managers before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Momentum vs. Trend Following

Historically, in academic literature, "momentum" was often synonymous with cross-sectional momentum, which involves buying winners and selling losers based on the persistence of relative outperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. [[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]], however, gained academic recognition around 2013 under the title "Time series momentum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This approach focuses on persistence in an asset's own time series, meaning an object in motion continues in motion until stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Time series momentum is about following momentum in individual assets across a basket to build a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. While most practitioners use absolute momentum or [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following]], some use relative basis [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following]], particularly in cross-sectional assets like currencies where there isn't a single directional benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Convergent vs. Divergent Strategies

The distinction between convergent and divergent strategies provides a philosophical understanding of investment approaches and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. It reflects an implicit belief about the world's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Risk-taking is influenced by beliefs, perspectives, and past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

*   **Convergent Approach**: Views the world as stable, dependable, and tending towards equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
    *   When convergent risk-takers win, it confirms their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
    *   When they lose, they tend to double down, believing the market will revert to their assumed equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
    *   This approach typically results in many small wins but occasionally large negative losses when their assumptions are wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   **Divergent Approach**: Views the world as non-deterministic, random, and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. It involves accepting the unknowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
    *   When divergent risk-takers lose, they move on, cutting losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.
    *   When they win, they continue, believing they've found an exciting new trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
    *   This approach typically results in many small losses but occasionally very large wins when big trends are captured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

[[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]] is considered a very divergent strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. It systematically cuts losses when things don't trend and follows trends when they increase, regardless of underlying belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. [[Trend following as a trading strategy | Trend following]] excels in divergent environments where things change unexpectedly (e.g., Ukraine conflict, COVID, inflation flux) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. It struggles more in convergent environments where markets consolidate and seek a "normal" equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

> "It's usually not what you know that is risky that causes you to go belly up, it's what you think that is not risky and then you add leverage to it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

This highlights the danger of convergent philosophies, where perceived certainty can lead to excessive risk-taking, unlike [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following]] which adheres to "knowing what you don't know" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

## The Concept of "Pure Trend" in Risk Management

"Pure Trend" involves increasing position size as a trend measures higher, linking conviction to position sizing based purely on market price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. From a divergent perspective, a pure [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following investment strategy]] avoids incorporating any convergent beliefs, such as adding a carry signal or other view-based assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

Historically, especially during crises, "pure [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following]]" strategies tend to react best to unpredictable and difficult market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. They are often seen as the first line of defense when convergent views are challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.

### Risk Management Considerations

The term "pure trend" often sparks debate, particularly concerning the role of risk management. Some argue that incorporating measures like correlations or [[Volatility Targeting in Trend Following | volatility targeting]] into position adjustments compromises "pure trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

*   **Constant Risk Targeting**: This approach aims to maintain a fixed volatility target (e.g., 10% VaR) for the [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. The challenge is that when signals are strong, positions are dialed down, and when signals are weak, they are dialed up, effectively introducing a convergent, mean-reverting risk-taking approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. While long-term backtests may show similar results, their profiles differ significantly during extreme environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Prudent Risk Management**: Many managers utilize a risk framework to stay within certain boundaries without necessarily targeting a specific volatility for the entire program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. This allows positions to remain dynamic and still capture large outlier moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. This approach is distinct from aggressive risk adjustment and is more about maintaining a consistent risk posture and diversification through guardrails on position sizing across asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

## Market Observations and [[Challenges and strategies in trend following | Challenges and strategies in trend following]] (2023)

2023 was a challenging year for [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]], marked by significant impact from rare events like the SVB regional banking crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. The year saw the dissipation of the inflation trade and profitable short bond positioning for parts of the year, consolidating in Q4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

Key empirical observations:
*   Fixed income volatility remained 50% higher than pre-2020 stationary levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
*   Stock-bond correlations continued to be positive, indicating a departure from the "Great Moderation" regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.
*   The SG Trend index experienced its second and eleventh worst days in Inception history on March 10th and 13th, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. Taking these two days out flips the index's performance from negative to positive for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>.

> "I agree with you it is a very outlier year even though the performance actually wasn't [concerning]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

Performance correlation across windows was historically low in 2023, suggesting significant consolidation and turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

### Drawdown Recovery

Analysis of the SG Trend index shows that after large drawdowns, [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] tends to have higher than average subsequent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:13">[00:42:13]</a>. This aligns with the strategy's philosophy of cutting losses until a large divergent market change occurs, which it then aims to capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:22">[00:42:22]</a>.

## Fixed Income [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | Trend Following Investment Strategy]]

The period of short fixed income signals in [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] lasted for nine quarters, one of the longest runs in over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. The fixed income trade generally follows three phases:
1.  **Inversion**: Beginning of the rising rate cycle, where [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following trading strategies]] tend to be short and perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
2.  **Flattening**: The yield curve flattens, and while trends are still likely short, performance can be mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>.
3.  **Stabilization/Steepening**: The yield curve stabilizes or steepens, leading to more long signals for [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>.

Empirical studies dating back 40-50 years show these patterns in [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following trading strategies]] persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. The shift to long signals in fixed income began in 2023, suggesting that if historical patterns persist, [[trend_following_in_investment_portfolios | trend following in investment portfolios]] will likely be long bonds more often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a>.

From the 1960s and 70s, bonds exhibited higher volatility and positive stock-bond correlations, similar to the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. This suggests that the current regime of higher bond volatility and positive stock-bond correlations might be more persistent than transitory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

While shorting fixed income typically faces a "negative carry" from roll yield, the significant drastic movements in bond prices can far outweigh this negative carry, making short positions profitable during large value declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>.

The traditional negative correlation between stocks and bonds, often assumed by strategies like 60/40 portfolios, was largely a phenomenon of the 2000-2019 period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:26">[00:50:26]</a>. Investors should reassess whether their portfolios provide the expected level of comfort in this new environment of potentially positive stock-bond correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

## Outlook for 2024 and Risk Anticipation

[[Trend following strategies | Trend following strategies]] do not predict future market movements but rather react to existing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. Overly optimistic market views on quick interest rate cuts are likely an underestimate of potential volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>.

The expectation for 2024 is a "bumpy landing," characterized by significant volatility in inflation and growth, creating a wider range of outcomes than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. This contrasts with a "soft landing" (smooth transition) or "hard landing" (severe disruption), implying periods of turbulence and swings between optimism and pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>.

Commodities are also being watched, as their movements often signal broader market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>. While they have been difficult to trade due to geopolitical tensions and demand fluctuations, a clear upward trend could indicate a new cycle beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. The ability of [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] to adapt and go wherever trends occur across different asset classes provides significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.

Global financial markets are frequently impacted by unpredictable events, such as the war in Europe, which few could have foreseen as a major market driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">00:00:09</a>. In an environment of increasing global uncertainty, understanding and analyzing the riskiness of one's portfolio, including whether one is long or short volatility, is crucial for survival when the next crisis emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:02">02:09:02</a>. This highlights the growing importance of [[portfolio_construction_and_protection | portfolio construction]] and [[the_role_of_hedging_and_portfolio_protection | portfolio protection]] for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:09">01:59:09</a>.

## Alex Gordaevich's Approach to Portfolio Management

Alex Gordaevich, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Houndstooth Investments and author of "The Trades of March 2020," brings a unique background to his investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:27">02:44:27</a>. With a PhD in mathematics from the University of Chicago, he chose an unconventional path into "actual strategic trading" on Wall Street, rather than purely quantitative research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:06">04:01:06</a>. His early experience as a market maker in fixed income derivatives, especially in esoteric products like municipal index swaps and basis index swaps, was formative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:07">05:01:07</a>. These less liquid products taught him that macro factors, like interest rate movements or crises, profoundly affect even seemingly unrelated trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:47">05:48:47</a>. He learned that different types of crises (e.g., war, recession, pandemic) have distinct impacts, meaning a strategy effective against one might not protect against another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:03">06:11:03</a>.

Running a large portfolio of client trades at JPMorgan Chase, which often involved multi-billion dollar notionals that could not be easily unloaded, forced him to consider how his overall portfolio was positioned across various scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:40">06:41:40</a>. This was his introduction to [[portfolio_construction_and_protection | constructing balanced portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:38">07:15:38</a>.

### Valuing Treasuries and the "Theory of Relativity" in Finance

Gordaevich challenges the common perception that Treasuries are overvalued, arguing that such claims have been made consistently since 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:06">08:05:06</a>. He dismisses the concept of "term premium" as "smoke and mirrors" with "absolutely zero meaning," unnecessary for deriving bond prices or swap spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:06">08:56:06</a>.

He identifies two primary ways to value any asset:
1.  **Supply and Demand:** Assets rise with more buyers than sellers, and fall with more sellers than buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:46">10:05:46</a>.
2.  **Cash Flows:** Evaluating the actual cash flows received from the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:20">10:36:20</a>.

His thinking evolved from a "hold to maturity" mentality, where bonds yielding low percentages seemed unattractive compared to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:19">11:56:19</a>. Around 2000, he became part of the discovery and implementation of what he calls the "theory of relativity in finance": [[risk_management_in_investment_firms | risk parity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:44">12:07:44</a>. This framework posits that bonds are not a displacement for stocks but rather an enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:45">12:26:45</a>. By using stocks as collateral to own bond futures, a portfolio can become both safer and more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:39">12:34:39</a>. This shift in [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | portfolio construction]], holding a combination of stocks and bonds in certain ratios, dramatically improves portfolio performance due to the [[hedging_strategies_and_risk_management | negative correlation]] between these asset classes, especially on a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:47">13:04:47</a>. Thus, bonds are viewed as protecting other investments while still generating returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:21">14:05:21</a>.

### Treasuries as Cash and Duration Risk

Beyond their role in [[risk_management_in_investment_firms | risk parity]], Treasuries function as a highly liquid investment, essentially "cash," that can be used as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:02">14:28:02</a>. While they are considered risk-free in terms of default, they carry duration risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:32">14:53:32</a>. A common misconception is that low yields mean limited upside, but due to convexity, a 30-year bond's price can significantly rally even with small yield drops, as demonstrated by Austrian bonds issuing at negative yields and then rallying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:54">15:00:54</a>. At around 3% yield, the risk-reward for bonds can be symmetric, even considering a complete default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:51">16:11:51</a>.

The post-2008 emphasis on collateralized lending has increased the importance of bonds, as the global debt market's rapid growth drives demand for safe collateral like Treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:09">16:38:09</a>. Even with increasing U.S. Treasury issuance, the demand for collateral from pension funds and foreign investors may outpace supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:07">17:50:07</a>.

## Trading Strategy and Psychological Aspects

Gordaevich generally prefers to avoid options as a client, noting the challenges of bid-offer spreads and the many ways to be wrong, even if the general direction of the underlying asset is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:16">19:52:16</a>. Instead, he seeks convex trades that offer positive carry, like Treasury bonds, or by carefully structuring trades with esoteric products to achieve convexity without negative carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:29">21:25:29</a>. Examples include being long the dollar to earn carry, or finding assets that are historically cheap with more upside than downside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:26">22:24:26</a>.

His approach emphasizes [[investing_strategies_and_risk_management | portfolio risk management]] over individual position risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:37:41">55:37:41</a>. It's crucial to understand the overall portfolio's balance and avoid cutting profitable trades that act as a lifeline in a downturn, as this can lead to further portfolio decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:48:19">56:48:19</a>.

He acknowledges that not every trade will be a winner, and mistakes are inevitable, even in successful years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:07">25:39:07</a>. A critical psychological ability for traders is to move on from losing trades without excessive self-criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:19">26:04:19</a>. The victory in trading is the ability to "play again," much like a poker session that never ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:35:05">26:35:05</a>. Trading is a lifestyle that requires constant thought, not just time in front of a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34:07">39:34:07</a>. The most rewarding moment is not making money, but conceiving a trade with high conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:06:14">41:06:14</a>.

### Crisis Trading: March 2020

During the March 2020 crisis, Gordaevich had confidence in the Fed's ability to inject sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:07">30:31:07</a>. He chose to position in assets like oil, TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), and dividend futures, reasoning that things would eventually return to a "kind of normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:50:35">30:50:35</a>. His rationale for dividend futures was that in a world where the pandemic eventually ends, companies would resume paying dividends, making their crushed prices attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:04">29:10:04</a>. TIPS were considered "insanely mispriced" at the time, indicating an expectation of inflation following the deflationary shock from the Fed's liquidity injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:02">31:14:02</a>.

While he foresaw an inflation shock, he admits to being "blindsided" by the magnitude of the supply chain issues that emerged in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:21">33:01:21</a>. During the height of the March 2020 panic, despite being down money on the month, he focused on holding onto positions like Treasuries and precious metals, which he believed would eventually rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:55:04">34:55:04</a>.

### Central Bank Dynamics and Future Outlook

Gordaevich closely monitors the synchronization and asynchronization of central bank actions, which create "causality flows" and investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:02">42:04:02</a>. For example, if the U.S. Federal Reserve becomes aggressive while the ECB maintains negative rates, interest rate differentials will widen, leading to dollar strengthening, euro weakening, and eventually, a lagged inflationary response in Europe that forces the ECB to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">42:11:00</a>. He views the Fed as a "juggernaut" that tends to set a policy and push it through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:07:05">45:07:05</a>.

He observes a trend of reducing size and duration of hike cycles over time, suggesting future rate increases might be even smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:10:48">46:10:48</a>. He questions the need for rate increases before unwinding the Fed's large balance sheet, arguing that balance sheet reduction itself provides significant tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">46:51:00</a>.

For the future, he speculates on a central scenario where the war in Europe resolves, potentially leading to a "catastrophic collapse" in energy prices within two years, with oil possibly going below $40 as Russia increases sales and other nations pursue energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:13:30">50:13:30</a>. This, combined with "late cycle" signals, could lead to a hard reversal in commodity prices and negative month-to-month inflation by the end of 2022, pushing rates back toward zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:04:36">51:04:36</a>. He emphasizes that while he has these speculative views as a layperson, his expertise lies in constructing trades without relying too heavily on specific forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:39">51:50:39</a>.

## The Unpredictable Nature of Markets

Gordaevich's career has shown him that every few years, an unpredictable event occurs – from the Asian Contagion and Russian Debt Crisis in the late 90s, to 9/11, the Global Financial Crisis, European Debt Crisis, Chinese devaluation, Brexit, Covid, and the war in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:14:48">57:14:48</a>. These events constantly redefine the global financial landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:22">58:28:22</a>. It is crucial for investors to remember this inherent unpredictability when positioning for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:32:00">58:32:00</a>. His approach to [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | portfolio diversification and risk management]] focuses on broad macro-level views and constructing resilient trades, rather than over-focusing on granular economic data releases which may be stale or revised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:33:03">53:33:03</a>. This strategic thinking and the ability to manage psychological pressures are vital for navigating the continuous "battle" of the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00:27">59:00:27</a>.

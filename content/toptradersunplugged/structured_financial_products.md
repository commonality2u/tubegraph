Structured financial products are complex financial instruments that combine multiple underlying assets or derivatives to achieve specific risk-return profiles [00:24:50]. Their issuance has grown significantly, especially in the US and Asia, influencing global market dynamics and volatility [00:24:50].

## Market Impact and Growth
The size of [[role_of_structured_products_in_global_markets|structured product]] issuance has become substantial relative to underlying markets [00:25:00]. This growth means that prediction and second-order Greeks (like gamma and vol-of-vol) are working incredibly well, particularly for strategies that take the opposite side of common positioning [00:24:55]. For instance, funds are now successfully buying what is high and selling what is low, essentially betting against crowded positioning, where dealers are often short [00:25:28].

In the US, [[role_of_structured_products_in_global_markets|structured product]] issuance tied to the S&P 500 has doubled in two years, reaching $1 trillion annually [01:16:47]. Global structured product issuance has also doubled, with a significant focus on the US market [01:17:00]. This growth is driven by the need for alternatives to traditional beta exposures, as 60/40 portfolios may underperform in the coming decade [01:17:47]. Options and derivatives, even those with [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] selling components, are seen as offering non-directional diversification [01:18:01].

## Historical Context and Regional Differences
The surge in structured products in Asia, particularly callable bonds, was initially driven by financial repression and mercantilist policies, leading to excessively low interest rates [01:19:01]. These callable bond structures, especially Bermudan swaptions, are massive and have been in use for decades, with the first known Korean callable bond issued in 1992 [01:19:50].

In Korea, at their peak pre-COVID, pension funds held 60% of their fixed income in callable bonds, accounted for to the call date, introducing significant hidden leverage and duration risk [01:20:16]. This led to considerable blow-ups in Korean rate [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] in 2016 and 2021 [01:20:29].

While US structured product issuance has focused primarily on equity space, Asian markets see structured products across various asset classes [01:19:37]. The belief in stability and historical lows in [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|FX volatility]] has also made FX-based structured products popular [01:21:04]. Historically, Asian markets have experienced a dynamic where prolonged [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] selling leads to extended duration structures, resulting in inverted volatility and skew term structures [01:22:20].

## Risk and Challenges
The growth of structured products, particularly those involving [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] selling, creates a "dry brush" effect in financial markets [01:13:12]. This "dry brush" represents leverage in the system, where seemingly independent assets become highly correlated when stressed [01:13:16]. The risk is not necessarily how a crisis starts, but how quickly it spreads through the highly correlated, leveraged portfolio [01:13:28].

Regulation, such as Basel 3 for banks, IAS 19 for pension funds, and Solvency 2 for insurance companies, has inadvertently hardcoded assumptions from modern portfolio theory and capital asset pricing models that rely on flawed understandings of correlation [00:30:15]. For example, liability-driven investment (LDI) schemes assume that leveraging gilts is risk-reducing, a notion that is mathematically incorrect [00:30:28].

This reliance on diversification in models often leads to underperformance because correlations prove to be too low in good markets and too high in bad markets [01:13:49]. When correlations break down, institutions are forced to reduce risk due to insufficient capital, leading to left-skewed returns [00:28:45].

The current environment shows an increasing dichotomy between structural [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] selling driven by structured product issuance and the underlying market volatility [01:24:03]. Equity [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] (like the VIX) is often compressed due to this selling, potentially leading to underperformance as a hedge, while other asset classes like FX and interest rates might offer better hedging opportunities as they are less influenced by these concentrated sales [01:03:01].

## Investment Implications
For investors, the core principle is to focus on positioning and leverage in the system, rather than trying to predict future events [00:27:04]. A key strategy is to own "negative carry" options or [[insurance_and_hedging_strategies_for_long_assets|convexity]], which acts like "distressed volatility investing" [00:37:37]. This involves purchasing liquidity that others are selling cheaply, holding it until the market demands it [00:38:08]. Such positions provide highly convex, asymmetrical returns, particularly if they are not marked-to-market over short periods [00:38:22].

A "total portfolio approach" emphasizes that only negative correlation and risk mitigation add value to a portfolio, not traditional hedge fund strategies or bonds [00:39:33]. This approach advocates pairing growth assets with highly asymmetric negative correlation [00:39:53].

The best [[systematic_investing_strategies|systematic investment strategies]] involve owning something with a decent weighting of US beta and opportunistic [[impact_of_structured_products_on_volatility|volatility]] in global multi-asset classes [01:25:52]. This approach has historically outperformed traditional portfolios that rely on modern portfolio theory and diversified risk [01:26:09].

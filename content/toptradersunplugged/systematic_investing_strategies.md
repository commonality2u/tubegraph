[[Systematic investing strategies | Systematic investing]] involves a raw and honest journey into the world of rules-based investing, focusing on dependable, consistent, yet often overlooked investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach aims to provide a structured method for navigating market dynamics.

## Core Philosophy

A key philosophical approach to developing and trading a [[systematic_investing | systematic investing]] system is encapsulated by the phrase "loose pants fits everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The market is inherently unpredictable in the short term, meaning systems should not be overly specific or constrained in their definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Instead, successful trading hinges on the ability to perceive the broader picture, the "shape of the price moves," rather than focusing on highly specific patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This flexibility allows strategies to endure numerous challenging scenarios, which is why long-term moving averages are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Risk Management

Risk management is a critical aspect of [[Systematic investing strategies | systematic investing]], as it's the primary factor traders can control, unlike returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Volatility Stabilization (Targeting)

A significant improvement in [[systematic investing | systematic investing]] work, particularly in quantitative strategies, has been the development of volatility stabilization, also known as volatility targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This approach involves targeting a specific acceptable volatility level for the portfolio, typically around 12% annualized for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

The mechanism works as follows:
*   Calculate the annualized volatility of the portfolio's daily returns over a recent period (e.g., 20, 30, or 40 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   If volatility exceeds the target (e.g., 12%), positions are cut to bring it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   If volatility falls below the target, leverage is increased to bring it back up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Adjustments are typically not made daily but when volatility moves by a significant threshold (e.g., 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

A surprising outcome of this method is that most performance improvement comes from *raising* volatility when it's low, rather than reducing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. When volatility drops significantly below the target (e.g., to 6-8%), the portfolio's expected return is reduced by nearly 50% if leverage isn't increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This ensures that long-run performance matches theoretical expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Reducing volatility when it's high (often during strong trends) improves the return-to-risk ratio by taking profits and reducing exposure when returns don't justify the high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Ineffectiveness of Fine-Tuning for Risk Reduction
It is a mistake to attempt fine-tuning a system specifically to reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Risk is inherent and will always manifest in different ways; trying to suppress it in one area often causes it to "pop up" elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The objective should be to understand the real risk and manage the portfolio to avoid being wiped out when it occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Position Sizing and Market Selection

### Equal Risk (Volatility Parity)
Position sizing is crucial for controlling risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. For futures traders, "volatility parity" or "equal risk" is a standard approach, ensuring that every trade carries the same risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Allowing one trade to have greater risk implies a prediction of higher returns, which is generally not reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Dynamic Market Selection
Instead of broad diversification across all available markets, a more focused approach involves selecting markets based on their past performance under the trading system's rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This relies on the "persistence of success," meaning markets that have performed well on a system tend to continue doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

Key aspects of this selection process:
*   **Ranking by Returns**: Markets are ranked based on their returns (not risk-adjusted returns like Sharpe ratio) over a relatively short period (e.g., 60 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Dynamic Re-ranking**: Rankings are updated daily, and if a market falls out of a specified top tier (e.g., top 10), it is replaced by a higher-ranked one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This can shorten holding periods, even for markets still generating profit, if others are performing better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   **Sector Diversification**: If only one sector (e.g., interest rates or FX) is performing well, total exposure in that sector is reduced (e.g., 50%) to manage risk, leveraging up only when more sectors provide diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>.
*   **Extreme Risk Exit**: An emergency exit is implemented if the portfolio's volatility exceeds a high threshold (e.g., 32% annualized for a stock portfolio) and the market is trending downwards for multiple days (e.g., three days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. This mitigates risk during correlated downturns when investors seek cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

### Market Characteristics and "Noise"
The efficiency ratio measures the "drunken sailor's walk" of a market, assessing how perfectly trending it is (ratio close to 1) versus how noisy it is (ratio close to 0) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.
*   **Trending Markets**: Interest rate markets and FX markets tend to have higher efficiency ratios, making them more suitable for trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>.
*   **Noisy Markets**: Equity index markets are typically noisier and better suited for mean reversion strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:42:58]</a>.
*   **Maturity and Noise**: Counter-intuitively, as a market matures and gains liquidity, it can become noisier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. This is attributed to diverse retail and institutional investor behaviors (e.g., random deposits/withdrawals, rebalancing schedules) that introduce illogical price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:30">[00:50:30]</a>.

## Profit Targets and Stop Losses

### Profit Targets
Profit targets are highly effective in short-term trading because short-term price movements are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>. Taking profits in multiple parts (e.g., three equal parts) is recommended as it reduces risk with each realized gain and makes it harder to turn a profit into a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>. However, profit targets are generally *not* suitable for trend following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. Trend following success relies on capturing "fat tails"â€”large, sustained moves (like those seen in interest rates, Tesla, or Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>. Taking profits prematurely prevents capturing these long-term gains, and while re-entry rules can be developed, they typically don't yield profits as high as simply maintaining the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>.

### Stop Losses
Similarly, stop losses are detrimental to long-term trend following systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. Exiting a position before a trend has truly reversed eliminates the potential to capture the fat tail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. Just like with profit targets, stop losses necessitate re-entry methods, which add complexity and often result in inferior overall performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.

## The Enduring Nature of Trend Following

Despite periods of subpar performance, [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | trend following]] is not "dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Its persistence stems from fundamental economic drivers and central bank policies that create long-lasting trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>. For example, central bank interest rate policies, adjusted incrementally over months or years, drive major trends in bond and forex markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. While increased market noise means trends might be identified later, and the portion of the trend captured might be smaller, the underlying trends remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:16">[00:55:16]</a>. Adjustments in portfolio items or leverage can adapt to these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:46">[00:55:46]</a>. Different markets also exhibit different trend characteristics:
*   **Interest Rates**: Historically the best-performing sector for trend followers, with long-lived trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.
*   **Forex**: Tends to have shorter trending periods than interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:04">[00:56:04]</a>.
*   **Commodities**: Often driven by supply and demand shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>. Agricultural markets, influenced by seasonal moves, require shorter moving averages (e.g., 20 days) to capture profitable movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>.

## Long vs. Short Trades

Historically, in [[quantitative_investment_strategies | quantitative investment strategies]], most performance has derived from long-sided trades rather than short trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>.
*   **Equity Markets**: Shorting equity markets with long-term trend systems is challenging because declines are violent and short-lived, making it difficult to enter and exit profitably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>. While events like the 2008 crisis yielded "crisis alpha" from shorting the S&P futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>, subsequent downturns have been too rapid to capture significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.
*   **Futures Markets**: Most futures markets have experienced price increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. Interest rate markets are largely long-only in terms of profitability on the short side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:22">[01:02:22]</a>.
*   **Challenges of Shorting**: Shorting individual stocks is complex due to borrowing requirements, costs, and the risk of positions being called away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:48">[01:07:48]</a>. Additionally, the upward bias seen in equity indices (due to survivorship bias) masks the "graveyard stocks" that have gone to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.

## Individual Stocks vs. Indices

When considering [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation | investment strategies and asset allocation]], individual stocks are generally preferred over equity indices for active trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Trading individual stocks allows for greater diversification benefits and captures the unique "personality" of each company, which is lost when trading a basket of stocks chosen by an index provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:25">[01:05:25]</a>. While there is a strong long-term upward bias in stocks generally, this is partially due to the survivorship bias in indices that remove underperforming or defunct companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.

## Future of [[Systematic Investing Strategies | Systematic Investing]] Research

While many core concepts have been discovered, ongoing research in [[systematic_investing | systematic investing]] and [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] continues to refine approaches. The use of multiple parameters (e.g., different calculation speeds) in a system is crucial to smooth out performance and make expected returns more closely align with actual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This acknowledges the unpredictability of which specific parameters will perform best at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:34">[01:38:34]</a>. The latest addition to [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic and trendfollowing investment approaches]] has been the implementation of robust extreme risk control mechanisms, which are vital given the increased volatility and correlation in markets during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:53">[01:23:53]</a>. This involves bailing out when high volatility combines with a downside shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.

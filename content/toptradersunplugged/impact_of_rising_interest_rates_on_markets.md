The significant shift in interest rate levels, from near zero to three to five percent, has a notable impact on global markets and various investment strategies like volatility and trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This change requires a reassessment of asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

## General Impact on Investment Strategies

In an environment of rising interest rates, the returns from having money in a CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategy also increase, as cash held by these funds earns more interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This directly contributes to expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

Historically, low interest rates have been a factor in advocating for alternative strategies due to low returns in traditional assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Now in a higher rate environment, the case for these strategies, from an asset allocation perspective, may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

Rising interest rates lead to increased interest rate volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. When the discount rate used to price assets becomes more volatile, asset prices themselves become more volatile, leading to greater dispersion in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Higher rates also lead to greater dispersion in market expectations, opening up new trading opportunities that were not present when rates were low and forward guidance was strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. This environment with changing discount rates creates more dispersion in pricing, leading to greater opportunities for strategies like trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[01:01:01]</a>.

## [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | Impact on Different Asset Classes]]

During inflationary regimes (which often coincide with rising rates):

*   **Equities**: Short-term volatility increases, and equities tend to flatline in nominal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. There is a higher risk premia due to a more two-sided market, and longer-term volatility is largely a "sale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.
*   **Bonds (Treasuries)**: Short-term volatility increases, and there is a directional decline as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. Volatility markets have seen a relatively efficient move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **FX (Dollar)**: Short-term volatility increases, and there is dollar strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Volatility markets have seen an efficient response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Commodities (Oil)**: Volatility paradoxically *doesn't* increase, which is counter-intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Longer-term volatility gets compressed because producers like OPEC can control the downside in a period of resource scarcity, acting like a "put" for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. This can create a secular upward move and an equity-like distribution for commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Short-term volatility increases, and there is directional strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Gold volatility, however, has not increased, making long-dated calls look cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

## [[Market volatility and interest rates | Impact on Market Microstructure and Liquidity]]

[[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | Rising interest rates]] contribute to a market environment with more uncertain and two-sided outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Less liquidity in the market means higher risk premia and more opportunities in diverse areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Mark warns that a fundamental decline in liquidity would be detrimental to many hedge funds and strategies, including trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>. He suggests that liquidity issues are likely to be a major factor in 2023, potentially causing market breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. The growth of ETFs providing liquidity for illiquid assets is also a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.

The treasury market is a specific concern, with issues noted in March 2020 requiring Federal Reserve intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>. Changes in market microstructure, such as less prop desk trading by investment banks, mean banks hold less asset inventory, making market making more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. While high-frequency traders tend to disappear when volatility increases, potentially widening spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>, bond market liquidity might improve in the near future as central bank balance sheets reduce and more bonds are available for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:17">[00:49:17]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Systemic Risks

The current period is characterized by more certain outcomes, more leverage, and more momentum, but also more extreme short-term tails, indicating a change in the distribution of outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. If the Federal Reserve loses control and interest rates continue to rise with less leverage in the system, it could lead to a more two-sided market, requiring greater diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Concerns exist around the stability of the pension fund system, especially given recent losses experienced by large public pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>. There's also a risk that if inflation rises again next year and interest rates continue to increase without a policy pivot, markets could lose confidence in central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.

The growth of the shadow banking system, including pension funds, hedge funds, and insurance companies, poses risks, particularly how the re-marking of private assets will play out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. The possibility of a non-linear reaction to higher interest rates, similar to the adjustable-rate mortgage crisis, is a potential scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

Other significant risks include:
*   Unforeseen systemic vulnerabilities, like the LDI (liability-driven investment) crisis in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.
*   Leveraged balance sheets accumulated during periods of [[impact_of_low_interest_rates_on_economy | low interest rates]] as investors sought yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:15">[00:59:15]</a>. These "cockroach" events, where one crisis leads to multiple others, are a real possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>.

## Outlook for 2023

The market is still adjusting to what is believed to be a regime shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. The shift from a period of cooperation and globalization to one of nationalism and protectionism, driven by resource scarcity and higher inflation, will lead to more short-term crises and more frequent "fat tail" distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:28">[01:03:28]</a>. This implies a higher risk premium and ultimately, higher interest rates for a more secular time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.

While there's an optimistic view that interest rates and inflation will come down in the second half of 2023, creating a "round-trip" environment for trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:41">[01:00:41]</a>, the potential for policy mistakes by governments and central banks will create further adjustments and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:53">[01:01:53]</a>.

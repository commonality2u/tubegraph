Rule-based trading strategies, also known as [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading systems]], involve designing and running a trading program based on predefined rules rather than discretionary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:04">[01:22:04]</a>. These strategies are developed to react to market conditions in a consistent and disciplined manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:48">[05:01:48]</a>.

## Tushar Chande's Approach to Systematic Trading

Tushar Chande, co-founder and Head of Research at Row Asset Management, is a notable expert in designing rule-based trading systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:09">[01:17:09]</a>. With over 20 years of actively trading these systems, he offers unique insights into establishing a successful [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:25">[01:30:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:09">[01:38:09]</a>.

Chande's background in engineering, specifically in high-powered R&D with a PhD, involved extensive mathematical modeling and simulations to understand underlying processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:27">[03:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:21">[03:09:21]</a>. This training naturally led him to primarily use quantitative methods, making the [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic approach]] align with his problem-solving abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:21">[03:22:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

He found the markets interesting because, fundamentally, they appear to be a random situation without a clear cause and effect relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:04">[03:56:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:23">[04:00:23]</a>. Despite this inherent randomness, Chande saw the ability to be original by finding rules that allow reactions to the market differently than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:06">[04:48:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:39">[04:54:39]</a>. This curiosity to deal with a predominantly random situation using a structured approach steered him toward [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:04">[05:19:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:09">[05:21:09]</a>.

Chande has also authored several articles and books on the topic, including "Beyond Technical Analysis," which has been translated into multiple languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:47">[05:48:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:27">[06:00:27]</a>.

## The Row Asset Management Alys Program

The Alys program at Row Asset Management began in November 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:07">[06:45:07]</a>. It is a medium-term [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following program]] that aims to capture different types of market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:05">[06:58:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:30">[07:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:04">[07:10:04]</a>.

A key aspect of the program is its robust design, using the same rules across all markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:04">[07:59:04]</a>. This approach contrasts with hiring specialized traders for different markets (e.g., bond traders, energy traders, currency traders), each with their unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>. While the rules are uniform, the program is designed to capture behavioral styles of individual discretionary traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:03">[08:11:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:03">[08:18:03]</a>. For instance, discretionary traders might vary position size based on conviction from external information (e.g., a new prime minister's mandate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:05">[08:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:08">[08:31:08]</a>. The Alys program incorporates rule-based algorithms to change position size, mimicking this behavior without needing to explicitly factor in specific news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:02">[09:15:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:03">[09:34:03]</a>.

### Organizational Structure

Row Asset Management is based in Zug, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:09">[10:17:09]</a>. They employ a high level of automation for day-to-day trading, reconciliation, back office, and record-keeping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:08">[10:24:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:04">[10:48:04]</a>. This automation ensures tremendous control, consistency, and disciplined execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:06">[11:47:06]</a>.

Key functions kept in-house include:
*   Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:07">[12:27:07]</a>
*   Trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:07">[12:27:07]</a>
*   Software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:07">[12:27:07]</a>
*   Client relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:08">[12:30:08]</a>

Functions that are partly or fully outsourced include:
*   Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:02">[11:08:02]</a>
*   Accounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:09">[11:11:09]</a>
*   Legal and compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:08">[11:13:08]</a>

Outsourcing provides third-party assessment, efficiency, and an arms-length measurement of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:03">[11:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:04">[11:57:04]</a>.

### Strategy Capacity

The Alys program's capacity is well in excess of a billion US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:07">[13:05:07]</a>. At higher asset under management (AUM) levels, more [[systematic_trading_systems | systems]] might be added, or execution issues related to slippage might need addressing to maintain profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:06">[13:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:06">[13:26:06]</a>.

### Performance and Market Environment

The Alys program's performance has differed after 2009 compared to before, a common experience in the CTA industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:05">[14:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:05">[14:12:05]</a>. While the fund has generally performed as designed, it wishes it had done better given the difficult macro environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:08">[14:16:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:03">[14:20:03]</a>.

The period after 2009 was characterized by fewer significant trends outside of equity and bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:05">[16:29:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:04">[16:34:04]</a>. This meant that managers with strong exposure to these specific markets tended to perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:06">[16:36:06]</a>. As a highly diversified trader, the Alys program does not overweight any particular sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:03">[16:49:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:04">[16:51:04]</a>, which made the environment unusually difficult for the last five years (as of the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:04">[17:08:04]</a>.

The "Rowe Trend barometer" measures the percentage of markets that are trending. A break-even level is around 42.5% to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:05">[17:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:05">[17:22:05]</a>. After 2009, more than two-thirds of the months saw trending markets below this break-even level, indicating a challenging environment for diversified [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:01">[17:42:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:09">[17:50:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:01">[18:03:01]</a>.

### Program Evolution

For managers with long track records (e.g., 20 years), it is almost certain that their current [[systematic_trading_systems | systems]] and market trades differ significantly from two decades prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:05">[19:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:03">[19:43:03]</a>. This evolution is driven by internal research, customer demands, and reactions to AUM changes or market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:02">[19:48:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:02">[20:04:02]</a>.

The Alys program has two roughly distinct periods in its track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:05">[20:58:05]</a>. Significant changes were made in late 2010/early 2011, stemming from events in 2009 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:04">[21:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:01">[21:26:01]</a>. The program started with three systems and now uses six, with most original systems still in use with minor modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:02">[21:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:07">[21:09:07]</a>.

### Key Performance Statistics

*   **Average Fee Structure**: Close to the industry benchmark of 2/20 (2% management fee, 20% incentive fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:07">[22:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:01">[22:26:01]</a>.
*   **Commissions**: Approximately $10 USD per trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:04">[22:37:04]</a>.
*   **Maximum Drawdown**: 22% (occurred in February 2010) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:02">[23:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:20:00">[23:20:00]</a>. This is consistent with their rule of thumb that worst drawdown is typically four times the monthly standard deviation (5.1% monthly standard deviation, implying a 20% expected drawdown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:03">[23:01:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:00">[23:09:00]</a>. They have managed to control risk well, staying within this drawdown range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:27:07">[23:27:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:03">[23:44:03]</a>.
*   **Offense-Defense Ratio**: 1.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:25:00">[25:25:00]</a>. This ratio is calculated as the average winning month (4.65%) divided by the average losing month (3.42%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:09">[25:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:05">[25:21:05]</a>. A ratio greater than one indicates the system responds aggressively to opportunities and shrinks risk during adverse conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:03">[25:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Winning Months**: Approximately 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:02">[26:19:02]</a>.

### Program Structure and Market Focus

The Alys program trades across 44 diversified markets, with roughly similar weights across major sectors such as currencies, bonds, interest rates, equities, and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:07">[27:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:15:03">[27:15:03]</a>. It has a notable commodities orientation, with over half of the markets being commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:02">[27:24:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:09">[27:28:09]</a>.

The core benefit of the Alys program, consistent with the role of CTAs, is to offset significant declines in equity and bond markets over sustained periods (one month to six months or more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:06">[27:54:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:06">[28:11:06]</a>. This serves as a form of "portfolio insurance" for investors with exposure to stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:08">[28:49:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:02">[29:12:02]</a>.

The program consists of three groups of [[systematic_trading_systems | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:02">[29:17:02]</a>:
1.  **Groups 1 & 2**: Primarily [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]], buying strength and selling weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:08">[29:20:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:24:03">[29:24:03]</a>. They allow markets some "wiggle room" and are designed to differentiate performance through initial risk, entry, and exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:01">[29:26:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:07">[29:38:07]</a>.
2.  **Group 3**: Serves as a counterweight to Groups 1 and 2, reinforcing the portfolio offset function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:02">[29:48:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:56:04">[29:56:04]</a>.

### Model Design and Implementation

The Group 1 [[systematic_trading_systems | systems]] are primarily long-short [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:03">[31:27:03]</a>. Decisions involve:
*   Determining whether to go long or short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:02">[32:01:02]</a>.
*   Setting initial risk (e.g., 1%, 2%, 3%, 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:05">[32:12:05]</a>.
*   Defining exit points for losing trades (stops) and profitable trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:01">[32:25:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:47:04">[32:47:04]</a>.

Instead of Market-specific models, the Alys program uses the same rules across all markets, ensuring robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:01">[33:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:03">[33:27:03]</a>. This means no system is designed exclusively for bonds or other single markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:04">[33:30:04]</a>.

The program primarily uses **breakout-style systems** rather than moving average crossover systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:07:05">[34:07:05]</a>. The reasons for this choice include:
*   **Avoiding unprofitable signals**: Breakout systems help avoid trading in narrow, range-bound markets where moving average systems generate many false signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:09">[34:17:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:07">[34:39:07]</a>.
*   **Improved winning percentage**: Breakout strategies allow for more creative entry definitions by combining a small number of conditions, aiming for a higher percentage of winning trades (closer to 45-50% compared to typical 25-35% in traditional [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]] systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:48:01">[34:48:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:04">[35:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:01">[35:38:01]</a>.

This choice also influences [[risk_management_in_trading_strategies | risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:15:02">[36:15:02]</a>. While moving average systems tend to be always long or always short, leading to a continuous equity curve, breakout systems create a discontinuous equity curve by avoiding positions in non-trending markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:03">[36:28:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:02">[37:09:02]</a>. This allows for a large number of positions when markets are trending and a small number when they are not, impacting the equity curve's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:00">[37:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:21:02">[37:21:02]</a>.

### Operational Details

*   **Inputs**: The models primarily rely on daily price data (open, high, low, and close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:53:07">[37:53:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:04">[37:57:04]</a>. They do not require fundamental data, other data sources, or multiple contract data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.
*   **Frequency**: The Alys program is an end-of-day trader, meaning the model is run once a day after trading hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:07">[38:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:30:00">[38:30:00]</a>.
*   **Order Types**: Primarily, stop orders are used, meaning trades are executed only when the price exceeds or falls below a certain level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:24:06">[39:24:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:03">[39:36:03]</a>. Spread orders are used for rolling over positions, and market orders are occasionally used for new accounts or trading errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:10:04">[39:10:04]</a>.
*   **Position Sizing and Leverage**: The strategy is "all in or all out," aiming to put on or take off the entire position at or close to a single price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:06">[39:57:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:11:06">[40:11:06]</a>. Position sizing and leverage are determined by embedding risk control in the design process, based on long-term simulations of the system, initial risk levels per market/system, and total standard deviation of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:04">[40:47:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:35:08">[41:35:08]</a>. All rules are automated within their Integrated Trading Platform (ITP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:41:06">[41:41:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:43:08">[41:43:08]</a>.

## Overview
[[Volatility in Commodity Markets | Volatility in commodity markets]] has seen significant increases, particularly in areas like oil and the dollar, prompting questions about its warrant and similarities. This surge is linked to changes in market dynamics and the influence of various entities like central banks and commodity producers. While implied [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in the S&P 500 has been described as "pinned and tethered," [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in foreign exchange, bonds, and commodities has increased across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:20">[00:54:20]</a>.

## Key Examples of Commodity Volatility

### Nickel
The London Metal Exchange (LME) has taken steps to manage [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in nickel. The LME hiked initial margin by 28% on nickel and targeted it for heightened monitoring due to heavy [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in recent days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This followed a significant fall of as much as 15% in nickel prices, which had already breached the LME's 15% daily price swing limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This situation reminds observers of earlier events in the year involving the LME and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Oil
The [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] for oil has dramatically increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Historically, oil has seen significant price swings, such as going from negative $30 to $180 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.

While there hasn't been one dominant force controlling oil prices for some time, an "OPEC put" is developing, suggesting a structural shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>. This is seen in a period of broad resource scarcity and increased competition, where entities like OPEC will likely exert more power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02">[01:07:02]</a>.

Ironically, despite the potential for demand for [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in energy assets due to these factors, [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] for commodities like oil tends to compress. This is because the downside is cut off, similar to how the U.S. announced it would refill its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at $72, acting as a "put" on oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:25">[01:07:25]</a>. OPEC is expected to defend prices, creating a two-sided market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>. This dynamic aims to control [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] while allowing for upside drift, making it look more like [[volatility_in_financial_markets | equities]] from a [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

### Gold
Gold is considered an asset that tends to perform well during secular inflationary periods, benefiting from first-order effects as a store of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:45">[01:04:45]</a>. There is a perceived significant opportunity for upside in long-dated calls in gold, especially since [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in gold has not yet risen as much as in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:57">[01:10:57]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Commodity Volatility

### Liquidity
The level of liquidity significantly impacts [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]]. During periods of inflation, there is generally less liquidity, which means a reduced ability to absorb risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>. This scarcity of players willing to absorb risk can lead to higher risk premia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

### Monetary Policy and Central Bank Control
Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, have less control over the dollar's price during inflationary periods due to their dual mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>. Similarly, bond [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] structurally goes higher when the "Fed put" comes off the table, as the Fed's ability to control and provide liquidity is diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>. This diminished control releases [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:52">[01:05:52]</a>.

### [[Structural Changes in Commodity Markets | Structural Changes]] and Geopolitical Factors
[[Structural Changes in Commodity Markets | Structural changes]] and geopolitical strife contribute to [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]]. Inflationary periods often lead to increased competition, protectionism, and fear, driving a flight to safety in certain assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:31">[01:04:31]</a>.

The reopening of China is also expected to drive commodity inflation higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

### Inverse Relationship with US Dollar Strength
Historically, a stronger U.S. dollar has allowed the U.S. to "export" inflation, preventing commodities from broadly exploding to the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. However, a declining dollar is expected to import inflation back to the U.S., which, combined with China's reopening, is anticipated to drive commodities that have been "hemmed in" a bit higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Trading [[Volatility in Trading Strategies | Volatility]] in Commodities
While there is limited implied [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] data from past inflationary periods, the general expectation is that risk premium tends to increase during such times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. This creates opportunities for those willing to "warehouse risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.

Despite this, the overall approach to [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | trading volatility]] in commodity markets must adapt to the new regime. It is possible that an interesting [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] selling opportunity could emerge broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

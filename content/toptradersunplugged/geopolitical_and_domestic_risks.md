The current period is described as a "trajectory moment," not just for the year but "in history," indicating a significant [[geopolitical_challenges_and_global_macroeconomic_trends | regime change]] from the past 40 years that continues to unfold non-linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This shift could accelerate rapidly, suggesting a "calm before a bigger storm" rather than a market crash, but a significant acceleration into a broader [[geopolitical_challenges_and_global_macroeconomic_trends | regime change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Landscape

Current concerns include the impact of the new US administration on Europe, particularly regarding the Ukrainian situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. There is a concern that support for Ukraine could diminish rapidly based on election campaign discussions, for which Europe may not be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. This situation is tied to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

Broader [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical issues]] are also on the radar, such as a Chinese ship being held in Denmark under suspicion of cutting two fiber cables in the Baltic Sea, which could open a "whole can of worm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. These events underscore the "regime shift" that will impact many levels beyond current imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

### Populist Periods and Market Dynamics

Analysis of US election years over the past 100 years reveals that while the average return is around 11.5%, five specific election years (1964, 1968, 1970, 1972, 1976, 1980) had an average return of 21.5% and were all up double digits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>. If these five years are removed, the average return for other election years drops to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:51:00">[34:51:00]</a>.

These high-performing election years coincide with a period from 1968 to 1982, during which the market generally went nowhere in real terms, losing 70% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:08:00">[35:08:00]</a>. This phenomenon is attributed to "populist periods" characterized by contested elections and significant political turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>. During these times, politicians "feed money to people" through Federal Reserve policy to get elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:26:00">[36:26:00]</a>.

The current populist period in the US began around 2009 with the emergence of the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a>. This shift is linked to demographic changes, as younger generations (those who experienced inequality) gain political dominance, shifting the "Zeitgeist" and political winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:26:00">[44:26:00]</a>.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a catalyst, akin to the assassination of Kennedy in the 1960s, releasing massive fiscal spending that extended populist policies for 10-20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:39:00">[47:37:00]</a>. This period, potentially starting in 2020, resembles the 1964-1982 period, but with the added factor of inflation driving nominal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:58:00">[48:58:00]</a>.

### Federal Reserve's Role

The Federal Reserve faces a "tricky situation" with a dual mandate but only one tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:30:00">[52:30:00]</a>. They are tasked with controlling an environment of structural inflation, which is expected to harm both sides of their mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:06:00">[53:06:00]</a>. If the "fed put" (the market's expectation of Fed intervention) is no longer valid, market volatility is expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:00">[54:21:00]</a>.

Historically, during populist periods, the greatest volatility is observed in FX, yield bonds, and precious metals, rather than equity or commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:46:00">[54:46:00]</a>. This is due to a time of de-[[global_economic_and_geopolitical_risks | globalization]], [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | global strife]], and the Fed's reduced control over economic outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. The recent US election is seen as an "acceleration point" for this volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>.

## Domestic Political Influence

The election of Donald Trump is seen as an "acceleration point" for volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>. His approach of "gutting government" is considered interesting but potentially problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. While his 2016 mandate included populist messaging and actions like tariffs, his tax cuts primarily benefited corporations and wealthy individuals, which could exacerbate populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.

Trump's ability to "pull levers" and secure more power, potentially extending his influence beyond typical terms, is a consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:35">[01:07:35]</a>. If he continues a dual approach of populist marketing (immigration, tariffs) alongside policies that primarily benefit the wealthy, it could prolong the populist cycle and lead to more volatile equity performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>. The impulse of populism and demographic realities are not going anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:08">[01:10:08]</a>. The dismantling of government functions without rebuilding them effectively could lead to further public dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>.

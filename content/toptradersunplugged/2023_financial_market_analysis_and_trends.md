The year 2023 was characterized as a challenging period for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. Key themes included the significant impact of rare events and the dissipation of the inflation trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Market Overview
Short bond positioning proved profitable for parts of 2023, contrary to common norms, before consolidating in Q4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. The short bond trade maintained momentum until October 15th, when the 10-year yield reached 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>.

The year also saw a low correlation across performance windows, suggesting significant consolidation and turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Despite Q2 and Q3 showing positive trending environments, and over 50% of days being positive for Trend signals across all asset classes, the overall trend index was down 4% for the year after a 28% gain in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:27">[00:40:27]</a>.

## Key Statistical Properties

> [!info] Data Points for 2023
> *   **Fixed Income Volatility**: Increased by 50% from pre-2020 stationary levels, indicating a continued high level of bond volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.
> *   **Stock-Bond Correlations**: Remained positive, suggesting a different regime for fixed income compared to the Great Moderation and pre-COVID periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>. This correlation has been positive for a long time, with the two decades from 2000-2019 being an outlier with negative correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a>.

These statistical properties suggest that the market has not yet returned to a "normal" state, as many anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>. The asset class of bonds has entered a new regime with significantly higher volatility and daily swings than previously seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

## Notable Events and Their Impact
The **SVB Regional banking crisis** significantly impacted [[Liquidity and market risks in 2023 | 2023 market performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. March 10th and March 13th, 2023, were the second and eleventh worst days for the SG Trend index since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. If these two days were excluded, the index performance for 2023 would have flipped from negative to positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. The recovery from the SVB event was robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>, though bonds later made new lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

## Fixed Income Trends
Trend following strategies saw nine quarters of net short signals in fixed income, one of the longest runs in over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. [[Market trends and macroeconomic factors | Fixed income trends]] typically follow three phases related to the yield curve:
1.  **Inversion**: The beginning of the rising rate cycle, where trend tends to be short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:38">[00:44:38]</a>.
2.  **Flattening**: Trend is likely short but performance is mixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:43">[00:44:43]</a>. This phase aligns with the experience of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
3.  **Stabilization/Steepening**: Trend signals tend to shift to long positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

Empirical studies spanning 40-50 years show similar patterns in trend signals, suggesting that fixed income behavior today mirrors historical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. Trend signals have begun shifting to long positions, indicating a potential stabilization of the yield curve in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>.

During the 1970s, bonds exhibited higher volatility and positive stock-bond correlation, a phenomenon currently observed again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>. Historically, being short fixed income is generally not favorable due to roll yield and negative carry, unless spot prices drastically move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>. When bonds are "crashing," the NPV change outweighs the negative yield, making short positions viable, particularly during inverted yield curves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.

## Outlook for 2024
Experts suggest that people tend to be overly optimistic and underestimate the volatility of inflation and growth for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. The year is anticipated to be a "bumpy landing" rather than a soft or hard landing, characterized by swings of optimism and pessimism as the market attempts to define its new regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

For [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | trend following strategies]], 2024 is seen as a period of draw-down recovery and consolidation, waiting for the next significant market signal as current data remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:56">[00:54:56]</a>. Commodity markets have been difficult to trade and bumpy, with trend signals generally short, but geopolitical tensions and energy demand dissipation create a tug-of-war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>. A pop in commodities could signal the start of a new cycle, with commodities often leading the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.

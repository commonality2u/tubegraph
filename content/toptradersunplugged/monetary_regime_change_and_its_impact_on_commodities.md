The current global financial system is perceived to be on the verge of a [[global_monetary_system_changes | monetary regime change]], likened to being at "11:59" on a "Doomsday Clock" for such a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>. This impending change is considered a significant catalyst for a major bull market in [[commodity_markets_and_economic_impacts | commodities]] and real assets, potentially lasting 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Historical Precedents for Monetary Regime Change

Historically, every major bottom in the commodity-to-stock price ratio and the subsequent start of a new bull market in commodities has coincided with a shift in the [[global_monetary_system_changes | monetary regime system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Key historical instances include:

*   **1929 – End of the Gold Standard:** Following World War I, many European countries suspended their gold standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. Efforts by the New York Fed under Benjamin Strong to devalue the US dollar through quantitative easing to help revalue the British Pound ultimately led to a massive stock market boom in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. Strong's policies were undone after his death in 1928, leading to the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This period marked the effective end of the hard gold standard that had been in place since the Napoleonic Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

*   **1968-1971 – End of Bretton Woods:** The commodities bottom and subsequent rally in the late 1960s and early 1970s correspond with the dissolution of the Bretton Woods system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. While often attributed to Nixon closing the gold window in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, it was actually President Johnson who signed a bill in 1968, indicating the dollar no longer needed to be backed by gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. This removal of capital requirements for the dollar led to a run on the bank and the eventual closure of gold convertibility in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

*   **1999 – Aftermath of LTCM:** The commodity bottom in 1999 was linked to the fallout from Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) and the Asian financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>. Asian countries had pegged their currencies to the dollar, expecting liquidity support from the IMF and World Bank, which did not materialize following LTCM's crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>. This led to massive currency devaluations and countries subsequently deciding to peg their currencies below market value to boost exports. This created the "dollar recycling standard," where trillions of dollars in US treasuries flowed East, contributing to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.

## Current Outlook and Catalysts

The current environment suggests a new monetary regime change is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

### Potential Agents of Change

While previously anticipated to come from BRICS countries (Brazil, India, China, and others) seeking a rival to the US dollar for international trade settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>, the most likely catalyst for change in the [[global_monetary_system_changes | global monetary plumbing]] could now originate from within the United States itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.

One notable proposal discussed is the potential for "monetizing the Fed's balance sheet," possibly by revaluing the Treasury's gold holdings, which are currently valued on the books at $42 an ounce, a stark contrast to market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. This, alongside proposed new tariff systems, indicates a departure from the previous dollar recycling standard model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

### The Role of Political Change and Populism

The current political landscape, characterized by figures like Trump, is seen as a "burn it down" phase in the "Arc of History," where people seek disruptive change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. Such figures, akin to Nixon, are capable of radical shifts like opening up China or taking the dollar off the gold standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. The prevailing desire for change makes significant policy shifts highly probable in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

### Timing of the Shift

While [[commodity_markets_and_economic_impacts | commodity markets]] have been undervalued for a long time (since 2015), the timing for a significant upward move is now considered to be approaching rapidly, possibly within the next 6 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. The shift in US policy stance and the political will to implement large-scale changes are key indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.

## Monetary Regime Change and the "Carry Trade"

The undervaluation of real assets and commodities is viewed as a symptom of a larger "carry regime cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This regime, prevalent from 1980 to today, is characterized by a "levered short volatility trade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. This involves borrowing cheaply and investing in higher-yielding assets, effectively being "short volatility" – betting that market structures and conditions will remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

Key characteristics of a carry trade regime include:
*   Outperformance of growth stocks over value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   Suppression of interest rates and risk, leading to higher valuations for far-out cash flows (e.g., conceptual stocks with high multiples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.
*   Similar patterns were observed in the 1920s, 1963-1968, and 1992-1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:12">[00:36:12]</a>.

The catalyst to unwind this carry trade is a "volatility shock" or a change in the underlying system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>, such as a [[global_monetary_system_changes | monetary regime change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>. When such a fundamental change occurs, it can trigger a forced unwind of highly leveraged positions, leading to crises and significant market dislocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

> [!warning] Portfolio Diversification
> Many diversified portfolios today (US, Europe, emerging markets, private equity, hedge funds) are effectively all part of the carry trade, making them vulnerable to an unwind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. [[commodity_markets_and_economic_impacts | Commodities]] are considered an anti-carry trade asset and therefore offer true diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a>.

## Impact on Specific Commodities

### General Outlook
[[Structural Changes in Commodity Markets | Structural changes in commodity markets]], including years of underinvestment and restricted exploration, are leading to supply responses across various commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The fundamental picture is increasingly bullish, with strong demand and constrained supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.

### Oil and Natural Gas
*   **Oil:** US Shale oil growth, the primary driver of global oil supply for the past 15 years, has turned negative, with most shale basins in sustained decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This marks a significant shift in global oil supply dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The US oil market is seen as precarious, similar to its position in 1970 when US production peaked and fell, leading to OPEC gaining market power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:24]</a>.
*   **Natural Gas:** US natural gas production has turned negative by 2-3% year-on-year for the first time in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is happening amidst massive new demand from AI data centers and increasing US Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. The current US gas price is 80% below the world price, and this disparity could close rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Europe faces a difficult energy situation and may struggle to secure US LNG exports if the US prioritizes domestic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:28">[01:14:28]</a>.

### Uranium
The uranium market is in a sharp deficit due to years of underinvestment and the unexpected continued operation and new construction of nuclear reactors worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Inventories are near zero, and there is no significant new mine supply expected until 2027-2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>. This creates a strong bullish fundamental situation, although uranium prices can be opaque and influenced by speculative movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. [[Geopolitical factors influencing commodity markets | Geopolitical factors]], particularly the concentration of uranium production in Kazakhstan, present a potential risk for supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

### Gold
[[Gold and currency dynamics | Gold prices]] are reaching new all-time highs with limited Western investor participation, driven primarily by central bank buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. Western investors are procyclical and tend to chase price, suggesting significant future buying power if prices continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. Central banks, being price agnostic, are continuing to buy gold as part of policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

### Bitcoin vs. Gold
Bitcoin is considered an asset outside the traditional financial system and not a liability of any entity, similar to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>. However, concerns exist about its suitability as a long-term store of value:
*   **Supply Growth:** Bitcoin's supply is designed to asymptote, not growing in line with GDP, which raises questions about its long-term stability as a store of value compared to gold, whose supply growth has historically mirrored real GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.
*   **Energy Consumption:** Bitcoin mining is a "huge energy hog," and increased usage would demand immense quantities of energy, potentially making it unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:54">[01:01:54]</a>.
*   **Carry Trade Asset:** Bitcoin has traded like a tech stock, a high-duration bond, or a high-multiple valuation company, indicating it is likely a carry trade asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. This makes it vulnerable to a carry trade unwind, as demonstrated by its poor performance in 2022 when traditional carry trade assets struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>. Gold, conversely, is an anti-carry trade asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications
There's a renewed appreciation for the fragility of raw material supply lines and the need for security of supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. While not explicitly a "weaponization of commodities" in the same vein as China's rare earth metal restrictions in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>, there's a growing awareness that secure access to raw materials is a strategic vulnerability in a more hostile global environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. The US is seeking to re-establish domestic supply chains for critical minerals like antimony and uranium, having previously liquidated strategic stockpiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:09">[00:50:09]</a>.

> [!info] Previous Weaponization
> During World War II, major powers like Japan (incursions in South China Sea) and Britain (coaling stations for navy) made significant moves to secure energy supplies, demonstrating historical examples of commodities playing a [[geopolitical_factors_influencing_commodity_markets | geopolitical role]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.

[[Volatility in trading strategies|Volatility targeting]] is a concept adopted by many successful Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) in recent years, aiming for a constant target of a specific [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] level, such as 10%, 15%, or even 20% products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This approach contrasts with earlier methods where managers might have simply accepted the [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] that the design of their [[trend_following_strategies | strategy]] naturally produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Historical Perspective

In the late 1980s, when the Turtle program concluded, the risk-free rate was significantly higher than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Investors at that time were more accepting of [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] and drawdown, as they sought returns that were three, four, or five times the risk-free rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, as risk-free rates have declined over the years, so has investors' appetite for [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This shift has led to a demand for lower-volatility products that better fit investor mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Views on Volatility Targeting

### Richard Dennis's Stance
Richard Dennis, creator of the Turtle program, expressed that he has "never quite understood the problem with [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. He suggested that individuals can modify [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] themselves by simply investing less money if it's a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. He does not currently manage money and is not familiar with how managers specifically target [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Jerry Parker's Perspective
Jerry Parker, founder and president of Chesapeake Capital and a "Turtle," holds strong views against [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility targeting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He states he has "no interest in the targeting and I just don't understand it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. While acknowledging that clients often desire it, he believes it is a "more sophisticated way of taking profits before the trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Parker considers a daily return average of 5% plus or minus as too much [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. He emphasizes that if a trade is stopped out with a 50 basis point loss, it's different from letting a profitable trade draw down 500 basis points before hitting a trailing stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He views [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility targeting]] as "just another way of taking profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Parker also suggests that the [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility targeting]] adopted by large CTAs is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. He links this to market events, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 1,000 points in August 2015, where CTAs likely played a major part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. He observes that when long-term trends reverse and [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] picks up, frequent crashes occur, possibly due to managers exiting trades simultaneously as [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. He describes [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility targeting]] as a "sophisticated" way of programming bad ideas into systems, akin to discretionary counter-trend philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

### Brian Proctor's Approach
Brian Proctor, a "Turtle" and managing director of EMC Capital Advisors, noted that after the Turtle program, his firm reduced [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] in their flagship program, though "not much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, they have also developed newer programs with different [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] targets to market to investors who have those specific requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This indicates a pragmatic adaptation to client demands while maintaining their core philosophy.

## Current Market Context
Recent years have seen fewer extreme trends and a contraction of [[volatility_in_trading_strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This has put performance under pressure for many managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Brian Proctor acknowledges that central bank intervention and government policies have reduced liquidity in many markets, making it more challenging for professional money managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. However, he remains cautiously optimistic that [[volatility_and_trend_following_in_markets | volatility]] may increase, citing examples like crude oil prices dropping significantly, which are beyond government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of [[diversification_in_trend_following | diversification]] and being involved in markets like commodities if financial sectors aren't trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

Jerry Parker agrees that markets are currently not trending strongly, with stocks being a notable exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. He considers the current low-return period a "lack of trends" rather than a "system failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. Despite the [[challenges_and_strategies_in_trend_following | challenges]], he maintains confidence in his [[trend_following_strategies | trend-following]] approach, stating it "does work" and will continue to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

Effective [[portfolio_diversification_and_risk_management|portfolio management]] should be constructed based on what is unknown, ensuring the portfolio performs optimally in extreme scenarios rather than merely anticipating average expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach builds resilience for unpredictable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Critiquing Traditional Portfolio Models

The traditional 60/40 portfolio model is fundamentally flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its bond component (the "40") often holds capital out of market-participating assets and fails to provide adequate, or eventually any, portfolio protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

The historical negative correlation between bonds and stocks, which underpinned the 60/40 model, was largely an artificial construct of the "Greenspan Put" era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Central banks would cut interest rates when asset prices fell, creating a multi-decade false benefit for holding these two asset classes together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. However, once interest rates reached zero, this correlation became risk-additive rather than risk-mitigating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The widespread adoption of "Sharp World mathematics"—a framework encompassing concepts like random walk, Gaussian distribution, efficient market hypothesis, modern portfolio theory, and Value at Risk (VaR)—has, in essence, encouraged financial fiduciaries to prioritize their own enrichment at the expense of long-term compounding for capital owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This has led to governments accumulating over 100% debt-to-GDP ratios globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### The "Sharp World" Critique

The "Sharp World" approach creates a "metaverse fantasy land" where:
*   Historical [[understanding_volatility_dynamics_in_investment_strategies|volatility dynamics]] and correlations remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Geometric compounding paths are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   [[Volatility and market positioning|Tails are never fat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Leverage is not considered risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Frequency matters more than magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   Ensemble averages dominate time averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

This framework allowed financial institutions to believe they could endlessly tranche and innovate derivatives to create "AAA super senior tranches" of subprime assets, treating them as zero-risk assets and leveraging them infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. This led to uncapitalized tail risks, where a small change in implied correlations could wipe out significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Embracing Unpredictability through Convexity

Instead of predicting market movements, the focus should be on building a portfolio for what is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>. This involves constructing [[investment_strategies_for_volatility|resilience]] and emphasizing convexity.

### The Importance of Extremes
In financial markets, the most significant impact on compounded returns comes from the "two percentile tails"—the extreme best and worst months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. For example, over a 40-year period, the 10 best months contributed about 30% of long-term compounded returns, while the 10 worst months contributed about -40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. This highlights that [[market_volatility_and_volatility_strategies|magnitude]], not frequency, drives returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

### The Football Analogy
Just as in a football match, where the ball spins 96% of the time in the middle of the pitch but only the 2% in the penalty boxes truly matters, market outcomes are driven by what happens in the extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. The goalkeeper is the most important player because they ensure compounding through multiple matches, symbolizing the defensive, risk-mitigating role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>.

### Convexity as Portfolio "Brakes"
Convexity in a portfolio acts like the brakes on a Formula One race car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. While brakes don't directly contribute to speed, having good brakes allows the car (or portfolio) to drive faster and more confidently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. This defensive positioning is crucial for long-term compounding, even if its contribution isn't easily measured by traditional metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>.

### Sourcing Convexity
*   **Value in Volatility:** This approach involves being "value investors in volatility," acting as "stores of highly convex liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. The goal is to absorb volatility supply where uncapitalized tails exist and liquidity becomes highly desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Understanding Supply and Demand:** It is crucial to understand the supply of volatility, particularly from structured product machinery and how banks manage their risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>.
*   **Focus on Asymmetry:** Rather than predicting market direction, decisions are based on potential asymmetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. This means seeking assets priced as if extreme events "can't happen," and someone is willing to sell them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>.
*   **Longer-Term Perspective:** This strategy typically involves a much longer time horizon than traditional approaches, continuously working to extend duration and convexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Identifying Areas of Opportunity
Currently, areas where central banks actively suppress [[importance_of_volatility_in_financial_markets|volatility]] and provide liquidity offer unique opportunities for sourcing cheap convexity:
*   **Japan:** The Japanese structured product market is the oldest and largest, maintaining an interest rate peg for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>. The Bank of Japan's ongoing efforts to suppress yields (e.g., the 10-year JGB pegged at 25 basis points) create an environment where volatility is artificially low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.
*   **China:** China's central bank actively suppresses currency volatility, which extends to interest rates. They are also engaging in informal quantitative easing (QE) by incentivizing state-related institutions to buy bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:35">[01:01:35]</a>.
*   **Europe:** Despite recent market movements, the European Central Bank (ECB) continues to provide quantitative easing (QE) and has kept policy rates low even with skyrocketing inflation. This creates interesting opportunities for long-dated volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>.

This approach focuses on identifying "dry brush" in the financial forest—areas where supply/demand imbalances and a lack of capital in the traditional financial food chain create high endogenous fire risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:32">[01:10:32]</a>. When a "spark" occurs, these areas experience significant [[market_volatility_and_volatility_strategies|volatility]] and provide outsized payoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. This leads to a layering of convexity, where lower-convexity outcomes are monetized to acquire more of the truly "insurance-like", highly convex positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>.

For large institutional investors who cannot actively manage risk or trade on short-term imbalances, improving portfolio convexity offers a way to enhance compounded returns and efficiently utilize capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This focus on "what you don't know" and structuring for extremes is a form of [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios|diversification and risk management]] that differs from traditional portfolio models and emphasizes the long-term benefit of robust protection against unexpected events, reflecting the true [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios|importance of diversification in portfolios]].

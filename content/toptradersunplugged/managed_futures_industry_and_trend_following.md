This article delves into the history and evolution of the [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures industry]], with a particular focus on [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | trend following]] strategies, as discussed by veteran hedge fund manager Marty Lueck.

## Introduction to Top Traders Unplugged
Top Traders Unplugged offers insights from hedge fund managers to help with manager due diligence or investment careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. It's important to remember that all discussions about investment performance refer to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or infer future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. All investment strategies carry a significant risk of financial loss, and specific risks should be understood from the investment manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

## Marty Lueck: A Pioneer in Quantitative Investment
Marty Lueck, co-founder and Director of Research at Aspect Capital, is a well-known figure in the alternative investment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. He was also a co-founder of AHL in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Lueck and his partners at Aspect Capital aimed to democratize the [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures industry]] by providing access to successful quantitative strategies without expensive structures or guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Their work at AHL is considered the root of many successful European investment managers of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Lueck describes his entry into quantitative investment research as a "happy accident" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Trained in physics at Oxford, he applied his background to developing investment models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. He believes that his career has unwittingly contributed to democratizing a new form of investment that genuinely benefits pension funds and individual investment portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

### The Genesis of AHL and Early Models
Marty's journey began after leaving Nomura in 1984 to work for Michael Adam's father's small broking house, Rocam Securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Michael Adam, also an Oxford chum, had taught himself Pascal and was investigating technical trading models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Together, they distilled a range of trading strategies into fundamental rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Their first systematic portfolio traded six commodity markets with Â£25,000 of family money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

They met David Harding, a Cambridge graduate working at Sabre Fund Management, where he assisted Robin Edwards, a chartist fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. The idea emerged to encode Robin Edwards' rule set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. In early 1987, after a difference of opinion within the Adam family business, Marty, Michael, and David left to found AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. They started with $100,000 of investor money from a client who bridged the transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

Lueck emphasizes that they didn't know about the existing US [[managed_futures_industry | industry]] at the time, operating independently from well-known experiments like the Turtles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. Their approach was like a "scientific experiment," using historical data and existing models to continuously improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. This scientific method became a significant feature of how the [[managed_futures_industry | industry]] evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>.

Initially, AHL's model was a breakout model that scaled into positions based on repeated patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:27]</a>. While they made "schoolboy errors" like over-optimization, the scaling-in feature made the models reasonably robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>. They later explored and incorporated moving average components into their program in the late 1980s or early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.

### AHL and Man Group's Influence
Man Group had a pioneering systematic CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) called Mint in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>. Mint funds were marketed globally, often embedded in guaranteed structures (like zero-coupon bonds funding margins), which was considered "absolute genius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. By the end of the 1980s, Mint was managing over a billion dollars, making it one of the first alternative investment shops to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.

AHL's connection to Man Group began through consultancy work, modeling how different funds were operating in commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. In 1989, Man Group took a stake in AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>. At the time of the stake sale, AHL had $30 million under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>. By 1994, when Man Group bought out the remaining minority shares and IPO'd, AHL had grown to $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:01:00">[25:01:00]</a>.

Man Group saw Mint as a billion-dollar business with 24 people, while AHL, with $300 million, had over 70 people dedicated to trading, research, and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. Man Group initially questioned the need for such extensive research and technology given Mint's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>. However, in the mid-1990s, Mint funds struggled, while AHL's research-driven approach started to deliver on its promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:00">[26:39:00]</a>.

After the 1994 IPO, Marty Lueck, Michael Adam, and David Harding largely went their separate ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10:00">[27:10:00]</a>. Michael pursued a software venture capital firm, and David formed a separate research team within Man Group, which became the genesis of Winton Capital Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:05:00">[33:05:05]</a>. Marty managed AHL through a challenging 1995, during which he had to dismantle much of the research and technology team, before leaving himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>.

### The Birth and Vision of Aspect Capital
After a year and a half break, Marty Lueck founded Aspect Capital with Anthony Todd and Eugene Lambert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23:00">[28:23:00]</a>. Aspect's core vision was to bring the [[managed_futures_industry | managed futures business]] developed by AHL and Man to an institutional audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>. The Mint/AHL business under Man was predominantly retail, structured, high-fee, and opaque, which institutional investors typically avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>. Aspect was founded on the premise that [[managed_futures_and_trend_following_strategies | managed futures]] had broad applicability due to their statistical characteristics and scientific rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>.

Aspect aims to be institutional in outlook, setup, and fees, with a focus on transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>. Marty highlights the intrinsic characteristics of [[managed_futures_as_a_diversification_tool | managed futures]], such as liquidity, directional agnosticism, ability to move risk, and diversification, as essential for a balanced portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:42:00">[38:42:00]</a>.

Initially, Aspect had ambitions to be a quantitative multi-strategy firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:00">[39:22:00]</a>. While they developed quant equity strategies, they closed that business after the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:37:00">[39:37:00]</a>. Today, Aspect is primarily a one-product (with various flavors) [[trend_following_strategies | managed futures]], predominantly [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | trend-following]] business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>.

### Aspect Capital's Organization and Culture
Aspect Capital employs over 100 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00:00">[40:00:00]</a>. From day one, they believed in thoroughness, not managing client money until they could support a 24-hour trading operation and had disaster recovery facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:34:00">[40:34:00]</a>. While they outsource some software, much of their operational infrastructure is handled in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:09:00">[41:09:00]</a>.

The research team, which has evolved significantly, currently numbers about 70 people focused on research, trading, and supporting technology within a 120-person organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:06:00">[42:06:00]</a>. The team is divided by labor, including a technical production team, software development team, core research team, and a dedicated [[risk_management_in_trend_following | risk management]] and risk review team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:22:00">[42:22:00]</a>. A product management group interfaces with clients to protect the research team's focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>.

When hiring, Aspect prioritizes cultural fit and attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:52:00">[43:52:00]</a>. They don't typically have a large graduate intake but make targeted hires for specific skill sets, such as statisticians or signal processing experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:25:00">[44:25:00]</a>. Marty emphasizes the importance of building a robust, collegiate research effort rather than relying on a top-down, character-led approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:16:00">[47:16:00]</a>. This team-based approach, fostering trust and delegation, is essential for program longevity, as no single individual can corner the market indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:00">[48:08:00]</a>.

Marty attributes his long-standing partnerships to choosing the right people to work with and maintaining commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38:00">[50:38:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the [[trend_following_strategies | Trend Following]] Approach
Marty views Aspect's track record as a testament to two things: the persistence of predominantly [[trend_following_strategies | trend-following]] models and their ability to capture positive returns in multiple economic scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:50:00">[52:50:00]</a>. The process is continuously evolving, akin to pharmaceutical research, where a pipeline of products (models) is constantly developed and improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:07:00">[53:07:00]</a>.

### Key Developments: [[Risk Management in Trend Following | Risk Management]] and Analogue Models
Two major developments in Aspect's approach are highlighted:

1.  **Increased Focus on [[Risk Management in Trend Following | Risk Management]] and Portfolio Construction**: In the 1980s, the diversification offered by the range of markets meant that [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] essentially self-risk-managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:56:00">[56:56:00]</a>. However, as markets became more homogenous and var metrics led to more correlated responses to events, the importance of explicit [[risk_management_in_trend_following | risk management]] and portfolio construction grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:39:00">[57:39:00]</a>. Diversification became crucial, not just across markets but also timescales and models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:40:00">[58:40:00]</a>. Carefully binding models together and managing edge cases became super important as portfolios grew more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34:00">[59:34:00]</a>.

2.  **Transition to Analogue Trend Capture Models**: Around 2004-2005, [[trend_following_strategies | trend capture models]] transitioned from a "binary" or discrete implementation to an "analogue" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. Early AHL and Aspect models used a range of binary models across timescales, meaning trades occurred in discrete chunks, leading to noticeable market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. As Aspect grew and markets (like FX) became more transparent, their discrete trading became a very attractive piece of flow for market makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The shift to analogue implementation allowed for smoother, effectively invisible entry and exit to markets, reducing market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:19">[01:09:19]</a>.

### Navigating Market Environments: [[Challenges and Successes in Managed Futures Industry | Challenges and Successes]]
Lueck acknowledges that the period after 2009 has been a "trying time" with underperformance for the [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. He draws parallels to the doldrums experienced after the 1987 crash, which took years to recover from, marked by similar factors like recession, government intervention, and suppression of risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>.

He emphasizes that [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is not "scenario specific" and models can adapt to whatever the markets present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>. The persistence of the approach is key. He highlights how low volatility and price range compression, evident visually in market data, clearly explain why [[trend_following_and_momentum_strategies | momentum]] strategies might struggle in certain environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:11">[01:04:11]</a>. Despite public perception that [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is "not working," many managers (including Aspect) have returned to all-time highs, yet this often goes unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. Marty reconfirms his belief in a systemic approach over discretionary macro trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>.

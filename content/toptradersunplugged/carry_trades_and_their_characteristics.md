[[The carry trade and interest rates | Carry trades]] have evolved significantly over the past 30 to 40 years, transitioning from niche strategies in currency and commodity markets to pervasive elements across global financial markets [00:04:00]. This period, often referred to as the "carry regime," has seen these strategies grow in size and scale to the point where global financial markets exhibit characteristics akin to a giant carry trade [00:04:17].

## Core Characteristics of a Carry Trade

According to Kevin C. Conroy, co-author of "The Rise of Carry," [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] consistently exhibit several key characteristics:
*   **Leveraged** [[Understanding and managing trading risks | Trades]]: They are always levered, meaning they use borrowed capital to amplify potential returns [00:04:32].
*   **Liquidity Enhancing**: They channel money from where it is abundant to where it is less abundant [00:04:37].
*   **Short Volatility**: [[The carry trade and interest rates | Carry trades]] perform well when market conditions remain stable and poorly when volatility spikes or "when things change" [00:04:46].
*   **Return Pattern**: Their typical return pattern involves "steady upward profits most of the time" followed by "occasional very large drawdowns" [00:04:55].

These broad conclusions about [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trade]] dynamics have proven accurate, notably playing out during the COVID-19 crash in 2020 and a "mini episode" in August [00:05:22].

## Carry Trades and Market Dynamics

A fundamental aspect of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] is that they are "a bet on stability" [00:07:05]. For instance, a Yen [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trade]] involves borrowing in Yen at zero interest and investing in a currency like the Mexican Peso at 10% [00:06:47]. If the exchange rate remains stable, the yield spread generates profit [00:06:52].

### The Impact of Volatility Spikes
Because [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] are always levered, they are inherently unstable [00:07:30]. A significant market movement, whether triggered by a fundamental event like a pandemic or a "random event," can cause these levered positions to lose money, leading to an "unwind dynamic" [00:07:37]. The COVID-19 crash, for example, saw an "absolute explosion in... the VIX," indicating that short volatility [[understanding and managing trading risks | trades]] lost money violently [00:08:26]. While the trigger was fundamental, the market dynamics were consistent with the unwinding of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] [00:08:45].

### The Role of the Dollar
Historically, the US dollar served as a funding currency for [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] due to low interest rates [00:09:58]. Investors would short the dollar and go long on assets like Emerging Markets [00:10:21]. This was supported by a "fundamental circulation of dollars" where US current account deficits led to dollars building up outside the US, primarily in China and commodity-exporting countries, which would then be reinvested into US treasuries, keeping rates low [00:10:26].

However, this dynamic has changed [00:10:49]. China no longer automatically recirculates its dollar reserves into US treasuries [00:10:52]. With higher US interest rates, the dollar is no longer the primary funding currency, giving rise to [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] funded in less liquid currencies like the Japanese Yen, which makes them more fragile [00:11:10].

### The S&P 500 as a Carry-Like Instrument
The S&P 500, despite current negative carry from a direct futures trading perspective (where funding costs exceed dividend yield), behaves like a [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trade]] due to deeper dynamics [00:24:27]:

*   **Banking Perspective**: S&P 500 companies can act like banks. They issue debt at a lower cost than their earnings yield, creating a positive spread. This debt is then packaged into highly liquid Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), which are held by asset managers as cash or cash-like products [00:25:03]. This process is a "classic liquidity transformation," turning illiquid debt into liquid assets, mirroring a bank's role [00:26:34].
*   **Insurance Perspective**: The S&P 500 ecosystem (futures, options, VIX options) provides an unparalleled insurance service to the global risk market [00:27:31]. It allows investors to hedge risks, similar to how an insurance company earns a premium for taking on risk and occasionally makes large payouts [00:28:20].
*   **Tail Wagging the Dog Perspective**: The volatility of the S&P 500 itself has become a traded asset [00:28:35]. Trading instruments like VIX Futures and VIX Options allow people to directly trade volatility [00:29:00]. Shorting S&P 500 volatility is considered the "ultimate [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trade]]," being profitable when markets are stable but leading to significant losses when volatility spikes [00:29:19]. This dynamic means that volatility, usually a derivative measure, can drive the underlying market's behavior [00:29:40].

### Carry Trades and Short Volatility
Short volatility [[understanding and managing trading risks | trades]] are inherently [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] [00:35:21]. An example is shorting VIX Futures, which profit from the curve rolling down if volatility remains stable [00:35:32]. While other [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] (e.g., Yen [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trade]], selling S&P 500 put options, private equity) may be structured differently, they share a common risk factor: they lose money when volatility increases [00:36:17]. This "common risk factor" has increasingly merged with S&P 500 volatility over time, making it difficult to build a truly [[diverse_trading_experiences | diversified basket of carry trades]] [00:37:08].

## The Fed Put and Market Leverage

Rising interest rates, counterintuitively, have increased the value of the "Fed put" [00:13:52]. The Fed put is the implicit assurance that the Federal Reserve will intervene to stabilize markets if they fall significantly [00:13:57]. As interest rates rise, the Fed gains more "scope" to cut rates and support markets, making this insurance more valuable [00:14:10]. This can encourage leveraged traders to take on more positions because the downside risk is perceived as contained [00:14:49].

Additionally, the payment of interest on reserves to banks (e.g., 5% on trillions of dollars) acts as a direct subsidy, increasing banks' reserves and making funding constraints less tight [00:15:05]. This combination of a stronger Fed put and looser funding conditions allows speculative leverage to continue rising, potentially more than expected [00:16:06].

This "Fed put" has become a permanent feature of the market due to the increasing "financialization of the economy" [00:50:31]. As a large portion of the population's wealth is tied to financial markets (e.g., through defined contribution pension plans), significant asset price declines become politically and economically difficult for central banks to tolerate [00:51:51]. This encourages being long risk assets, especially in the S&P 500, where the "put is kind of most applicable" [00:53:12].

## Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Implications

The growth of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] implies a significant increase in leverage across the financial system [00:41:12]. The book suggests that the "carry regime" might ultimately end with inflation, as higher debt needs to be inflated away [00:41:44].

Historically, central bank interventions to fight deflationary shocks (e.g., 1997, 2001, 2008, 2020) were aligned with the underlying risk [00:18:14]. However, in an inflationary environment, responding with liquidity injections becomes riskier [00:18:38]. The ability of central banks to "get away with" interventions during inflationary periods (like the Silicon Valley Bank situation or the British pension fund crisis) depends on whether the market perceives the problem as a local liquidity issue or a symptom of a wider systemic problem [00:19:35].

### Long-Term Economic Risks
The long-term economic risk of a growing carry regime is a "rising debt misallocation of capital and a falling growth long-term growth rate" [00:57:03]. This was reflected in periods of zero or negative long-term real interest rates [00:57:32]. The behavior of real interest rates is a key indicator of whether this carry regime is undermining real economic growth [00:58:02].

### Geopolitical Impact
Geopolitics impacts [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]], primarily through changes in global capital flows [01:00:02]. The reduced recycling of foreign exchange reserves by countries like China back into US treasuries decreases demand for treasuries, potentially leading to upward pressure on US interest rates [01:01:08]. This also makes the dollar's role as a reserve currency more questionable, though no viable alternative currently exists [01:01:36].

The growth of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] and the ability of short-term traders to move large sums of money can overwhelm smaller markets like Emerging Markets [01:02:03]. This has led to a questioning of the consensus that "open unfettered short-term capital flows is a good thing" [01:02:26]. Future regulatory responses might include "transactions taxes or capital flow restrictions" to mitigate the scale of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] [01:02:49].

## Trading Implications

[[Understanding and managing trading risks | Profiting]] from an unwind of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] is challenging due to the need for "very, very precise" timing, which is difficult for most investors [00:46:47]. A potential strategy involves having cash available to buy assets that get unwound at a discount [00:47:18]. This "buying the dip" can be a form of [[the carry trade and interest rates | carry trade]] itself [00:47:47]. However, this strategy is more comfortable when interest rates are higher (e.g., 5% in the US), as the opportunity cost of holding cash is lower [00:48:11]. In a zero-interest-rate environment with positive inflation, holding cash incurs a negative opportunity cost, making it harder to implement [00:48:25].

### Regulatory Considerations
The growing financialization and the S&P 500's role as a banking and insurance-like service suggest a potential need for tighter regulation of the S&P 500 ecosystem, similar to regulated banks or insurance companies [00:55:10]. This could involve "more tight limits on margin to begin with" to control leverage [00:54:26]. However, market history suggests that ways around such controls often emerge [00:54:34]. The current trend, particularly with products like zero DTE (zero days to expiration) options on individual stocks, indicates a continued expansion of leveraged [[shortterm_trading_strategies | trading]] [00:55:57].

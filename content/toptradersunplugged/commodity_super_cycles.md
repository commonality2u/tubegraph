Commodity markets are characterized by long, cyclical movements, often referred to as "super cycles," though some argue that the term "super cycle" is inappropriate, preferring to simply call them long cycles. These [[commodities_role_in_economic_cycles_and_investment_strategies | cycles]] are fundamentally driven by the capital spending cycle in both the energy and extractive metals industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Mechanics of Commodity Cycles

A typical commodity cycle unfolds through several phases:
*   **Deficit and Price Rises** Periods of slight deficit in commodity supply lead to dramatic price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Companies in these sectors can earn "super normal profits," with yearly cash flow returns potentially exceeding 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Capital Inflow and Supply Lag** Money flows into the sector to chase these high returns, leading to strong stock performance and a "virtuous cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. However, there's a significant delay in bringing new supply online in mining and energy industries, as it involves discovery, proving reserves, and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This delay prolongs the period of super normal profits, attracting excessive capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Surplus and Price Collapse** Eventually, too much supply comes online, shifting the market from deficit to surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Prices collapse, and investor returns plummet, with equity stocks commonly falling 80% in bear market troughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Projects underwritten at high prices become uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Money then pours out of the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Metrics for Identifying Cycle Position

Several metrics are used to assess where the market is within a commodity cycle:
*   **Capital Spending Cycles** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>
*   **Energy and Metals Weighting in Indices** (e.g., S&P 500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
*   **Broad Ratio of Commodity Prices to Stock Prices** (data available for 130 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>

These indicators typically show a period of market collapse and capital spending decline, followed by a reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. When an area is starved of capital for an extended period, supply disruptions occur as depletion takes hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Historical Precedents and Triggers

Historically, major shifts in [[structural_changes_in_commodity_markets | global monetary systems]] or regimes have coincided with the triggers for new [[commodities_role_in_economic_cycles_and_investment_strategies | commodity bull markets]] and strong outperformance of resource stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>:

*   **1929** The end of the classical gold standard, marked by the reversal of Benjamin Strong's quantitative easing policies, led to a stock market collapse but strong absolute and relative outperformance of natural resource equities over the next decade (1929-1940) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.
*   **1968/1970s** The bottoming of the commodities-to-equity ratio in 1968 coincided with President Johnson taking the dollar off gold, preceding Nixon's official closing of the gold window in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This marked the effective end of the Bretton Woods exchange standard and the beginning of an "incredible bull run" for commodity stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.
*   **1999** A complete reordering of Southeast Asian and Chinese Central Bank policies, shifting from dollar pegs to below-market rate pegs to spur exports, resulted in trillions of dollars' worth of treasuries moving East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. This monetary shift corresponded with the start of another period of radical outperformance for commodities and commodity stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

These three historical instances, spanning the entire period of modern finance, suggest that shifts in the monetary system act as crucial catalysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

## Current Market View and Investment Implications

The market is believed to be in the "very early innings of a prolonged and quite large bull cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Commodity prices collapsed between 2010 and 2020, and the market is now in the early stages of reversing that trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Key observations:
*   **Undervalued Assets** Resource equities, particularly energy stocks, are significantly undervalued relative to the S&P 500, with energy weighting at 3.4% as of September 2024, compared to a long-term average of 10-12% and bear market lows of 5-6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.
*   **Supply Disruptions** Major supply disruptions are occurring across various commodities, including crude oil, natural gas, and uranium, due to prolonged underinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Leadership from Extractive Industries** Since the lows of 2020, energy has been outperforming, which is typical for the early stages of a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Quiet Bull Market** The current bull market has been "quiet," with uranium being the main standout so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Strong performance is anticipated for oil, natural gas, uranium, gold, and copper in the next year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Gold
[[gold_and_commodity_cycles | Gold]] is currently considered cheap relative to financial assets, with a fair valuation potentially closer to $10,000 an ounce given the money printed in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Gold stocks are as cheap as they've ever been relative to the spot gold price, comparable to 1999 and 2015 lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The divergence between Western investors shedding gold (e.g., through ETFs) and central banks accumulating gold (more than Western investors are selling) has driven prices higher but kept gold equities undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Copper
Conventional wisdom suggests long-term bullishness for copper due to limited new mine supply and increasing demand from countries like India and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. Demand from these countries is growing significantly (e.g., 30% year-on-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. While the market is currently tight, new [[technological_advancements_and_their_effects_on_commodity_prices | technologies]] in exploration and materials processing could lead to a significant supply response by the end of the decade, potentially disrupting the market as SX-EW technology did in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.

### Oil and Natural Gas
US natural gas production is experiencing a significant decline (5% down in the first seven months of 2024), leading to a rapid balancing of inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. All major US shale oil plays, including the Permian, have seen production roll over since December, marking a decline in the primary source of non-OPEC oil supply growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:56">[01:14:56]</a>. This is seen as a precursor to a large move higher in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:25]</a>. The US Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been significantly drawn down, from 650 million barrels in 2020 to 375 million barrels in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.

## Investment Approach

Investing in [[investment_strategies_in_commodities | commodities]] during these cycles requires a focus on long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>.
*   **Producers over Underlying Commodity** It is often preferable to invest in producers (e.g., mining companies, energy companies) rather than directly in the underlying commodity, especially due to contango in futures markets and the potential for earnings leverage and re-rating of producer equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Contrarian View** The best times to invest are when commodities are undervalued, and investor sentiment is low, making it a contrarian trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Mentality** Patience is crucial as markets can remain undervalued for extended periods. The cost of holding undervalued assets may be low, but the "voting machine" (short-term market sentiment) can diverge from the "weighing machine" (long-term fundamentals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. Real-time data and disruptive events often act as catalysts to force market recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **[[volatility_in_commodity_markets | Volatility]] and Chaos** Moves higher in commodity prices are expected to be volatile and chaotic, with significant pullbacks possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. A "long and strong hands" approach is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.

### The "Carry Trade" Hypothesis
There is a theory that the global market, particularly the S&P 500, has become one giant carry trade. In this scenario, [[commodities_role_in_economic_cycles_and_investment_strategies | commodity markets]], or the broader "real asset trade," appear to be on the other side, acting as a funding mechanism or a "short" that helps propel the long side of the carry trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. An unwind of this carry trade could initiate a rethinking of global monetary systems and serve as a catalyst for a bottom in real assets relative to financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. This aligns with the historical precedent of monetary system shifts triggering commodity bull markets.

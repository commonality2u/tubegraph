Very low interest rates are likened to fertilizer that can "over fertilize the environment" and lead to a "weak and fragile ecosystem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This metaphor is extended to central bankers preventing "creative destruction," similar to the US Forest Service preventing forest fires, which ultimately leads to a build-up of undergrowth and more severe fires, resulting in a less healthy forest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Background and Evolution of Ideas

Edward Chancellor, a financial historian, journalist, and investment strategist, became interested in the role of interest rates after publishing "Devil Take the Hindmost," a book on financial speculation, in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. His initial focus was on speculative manias, particularly influenced by behavioral finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

The [[impact_of_easy_monetary_policy | impact of easy monetary policy]] became apparent to him after the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, when the Federal Reserve cut rates and supplied liquidity, leading to a final surge in the dot-com boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. After the dot-com bust, the Fed again lowered rates to one percent, initiating a global credit boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Following the Global Financial Crisis, interest rates dropped even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Chancellor and his co-author Jamie Lee undertook a long-term interest rate project, discovering that interest rates are not mean-reverting, challenging conventional equity-centric models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This led him to believe that "through the prism of the interest rate, you can begin to understand all the extraordinary low interest rates of the last decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, providing a holistic picture of financial markets, the broader economy, and even the roots of popular discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. He also noted that China's epic credit and real estate booms could be explained through the lens of [[interest_rates_and_monetary_policy | interest rates and monetary policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Chancellor criticizes the central banks' sole fixation on short-term inflation as a guide for setting interest rates, arguing that this approach in a low-inflation environment created conditions for speculative and credit bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. He suggests that contemporary economists often neglect economic history and the history of economic thought, leading to a deprivation of "rich insights of earlier writers on interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This neglect stems from an "illusion that you're dealing with a hard science rather than a social science" and a "desire to make your understanding tractable through a model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

## Unintended Consequences of Low Interest Rates

Low interest rates are argued to have a causal, long-term effect on an economy's performance, contrary to the view that [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_markets | monetary policy]] only affects the cyclical part of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

### Savings and Debt Accumulation
The conventional view is that lower interest rates encourage spending and investment during economic slowdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. However, Chancellor argues that at ultra-low rates, people might save more. Interest is seen as a reward for abstinence and a way of compounding wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>. If low interest rates slow wealth compounding, future consumption will be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

Furthermore, low rates encourage taking on more debt. The subprime crisis saw private sector debt increase significantly in the US, UK, Spain, and Ireland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. This leads to a "balance sheet recession," where too much debt relative to income becomes a drag on demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. The build-up of private sector debt and lack of savings ultimately lowers future consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Low interest rates can also lower current consumption for some, as individuals may need to save more to reach long-term goals like retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. Different cultural and asset exposures influence this response; for instance, Germans, with more assets in cash and bonds, felt the pain of negative rates more than Anglo-Saxons, whose real estate and equity values often offset low savings returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

### Malinvestment and "Zombification"
Ultra-low interest rates can lead to "malinvestment," a concept from the Austrian School of economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. This occurs when capital is tied up for longer periods in "roundabout methods of production" that may not actually improve productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

A significant consequence is the rise of "zombie companies"â€”firms that are unprofitable but allowed to limp along due to low borrowing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. This phenomenon was first identified in Japan in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>. In Europe, after the Euro debt crisis, countries like Greece and Italy had low insolvency rates despite needing reallocation of resources, because of the loan forbearance policy enabled by the ECB's ultra-low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

Zombie companies negatively impact the economy by:
*   Forcing more efficient companies to pay higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   Reducing job creation and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   Decreasing new market entrants, hindering Schumpeterian "creative destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.

This creates a feedback loop: low rates beget low growth, which begets even lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.

Beyond traditional industrial zombies, low interest rates also fuel highly speculative investments in the tech sector, funding "unicorns" (companies with billion-dollar valuations that haven't turned a profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. When capital is "in effect free," the distance to future profits doesn't matter, encouraging risky projects that may never materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. Much of this capital may not be productivity-enhancing, leading to "Pie in the Sky Ventures" rather than useful economic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>. These businesses are often "casino chips," designed to solve for capitalization rates and prepare for IPOs, drawing in vast amounts of capital because low interest rates incentivize chasing "long shot" bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

While some argue that bubbles can have long-term benefits (e.g., fiber optic cables from the dot-com boom), Chancellor contends that often, the investment leads to oversupply and an inefficient allocation of capital, transferring wealth from investors to consumers rather than creating mutually beneficial utility and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>.

### Globalization Bubble and Supply Chain Fragility
Low interest rates have facilitated the creation of complex global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. Historically, periods of rampant globalization in the 19th century were associated with declining interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. Global trade, largely financed in dollars, benefits from cheaper dollar funding when interest rates are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

The ability to access cheap labor globally and the dampening effect on domestic labor bargaining power contribute to disinflation or deflation in traded goods, which in turn induces a decline in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:22">[00:54:22]</a>. However, this encouragement of longer supply chains also makes them more fragile to [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets | rising interest rates]] and external shocks, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>. There is also a political backlash from workers who see jobs outsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

## Critique of Central Banking and Broader Implications

Central bankers face a complex task, but their narrow focus on inflation targets risks destabilizing other areas of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. The policy of "clean up afterwards" regarding speculative bubbles, as seen with Alan Greenspan during the dot-com boom and Ben Bernanke's stance against pricking bubbles, leads to "building up a bigger problem to solve the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Each intervention encourages fragility and growing debt, requiring even larger interventions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:26">[01:08:26]</a>.

Friedrich Hayek criticized the policy of "price stabilization" in the 1920s, arguing that fixing one price (the interest rate) when all others are fluctuating leads to malinvestment, and this criticism was supported by other leading economists of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. The failure to learn this lesson contributed to the Great Crash and Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:10">[01:02:10]</a>. Bernanke's interpretation of the Great Depression, borrowed from Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, is seen as too narrow, ignoring the underlying issues of the 1920s and the Hayekian critique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.

Ultimately, Chancellor argues that zero interest rate policies pose a "genuine threat to capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:41">[01:09:41]</a>. In a market economy, the interest rate is the "universal price," the most important price in the capitalist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. When this price is controlled by a small body of people, it raises questions about accountability and inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.

When the system malfunctions due to low productivity, investment, and savings, and financial fragility, it requires "greater and greater State intervention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:12">[01:11:12]</a>. This has manifested in central banks not only lowering rates to zero or negative and buying government bonds, but also intervening in credit markets and even expressing views on "green investment" or decarbonization, representing a "creeping advance of... Central Bank capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>.

For capitalism to work, it must deliver productivity and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. It must also allow ordinary people without significant advantages to accumulate capital, buy homes, and save for retirement, thereby fostering a "stake in the society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:38">[01:12:38]</a>. Low interest rates make "the price of security more expensive," pushing retirement savings, homeownership, and education out of reach for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>. When security becomes unattainable, fewer people support the system, leading to its atrophy and corrosion from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a>.

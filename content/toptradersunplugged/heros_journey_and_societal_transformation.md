Society requires [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | common action]], which in turn needs a [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | common narrative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The current challenge is that systems of [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | common communication]] and [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | common narrative]] have broken down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This has led to a [[disintegration_of_trust_and_social_narratives | disintegration of the stories]] and [[disintegration_of_trust_and_social_narratives | collapsing of the institutions]] in America today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Hero's Journey as a Societal Framework

The concept of the hero's journey, as explored by Joseph Campbell in "A Hero of a Thousand Faces," provides a mythological framework for understanding transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "cosmogenic cycle" plays out across various religions and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The critical aspect of the hero's journey is transformation through crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

Applying this framework to society, it's suggested that America, for 40 years, has not experienced a "real crisis" that necessitates transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Instead, it has been in a period of stasis, which leads to entropy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The notion of "not heeding the call" implies a refusal to confront necessary challenges, leading to a "wasteland of dry stones" and a sense of meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

## Societal Crisis and Transformation

### Myth and Nihilism
Society's [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | myths]] or stories about itself have broken down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This breakdown contributes to nihilism, particularly "financial nihilism," which views speculative objects as intrinsically worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This phenomenon has been observed in crypto and later in equity markets, exemplified by [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | GameStop]] and [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | Herz]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The underlying story that bred this financial nihilism is identified as the neoliberal philosophy, which emphasizes market efficiency and global GDP but has resulted in wealth and income discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

The [[disintegration_of_trust_and_social_narratives | degradation of myths]] also extends to the United States' role in the world since the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Events like the [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003]] exposed hypocrisy and assaulted institutions, breeding nihilism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### The Role of Accountability and Trust
A lack of accountability for crises, such as financial failures or wars, breeds nihilism by shattering the belief in consequences and revealing that "hard rules" are not always upheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. This absence of accountability creates a moral vacuum and erodes trust in institutions, leading to an expectation that leaders will lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

### Challenges to Societal Transformation
For society to embark on its hero's journey and heed the call, it requires "unity of will" to summon courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. However, the sowing of disunity and chaos prevents the emergence of a unified narrative or belief structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:59">[00:38:59]</a>. This disunity is further exacerbated by the decentralized nature of modern information ecosystems, particularly social media platforms, making [[common_narrative_and_societal_disintegration | common communication]] and control more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>.

Unlike individual transformation, collective action is much harder and often requires an external intervention to compel action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. For example, during [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | World War II]], the American public only fully united after [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | Pearl Harbor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

### The Future of Societal Transformation
The question remains how far society is into its [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | fourth turning]] and when a [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | first turning]] might occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>. A significant crisis is needed to bring people together, as the country is still in a state of disunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. This crisis could be an economic depression or something more existential, potentially involving war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

A key distinction between the current state and past turbulent times, such as [[impact_of_historical_events_on_generational_shifts | 1969 with race riots and the Vietnam War]], is that today, chaos and disorder exist not only within the general public but also among the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This disunity at the elite level means the political system itself is at risk, and the nature of future changes remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:30]</a>.

Despite the current challenges, it is believed that a real crisis is coming, and the question is its depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>. The timing of this societal transformation might be tied to [[generational_power_shifts_and_inequality | generational power shifts]], specifically the rise of [[generational_power_shifts_and_inequality | millennials]] to political dominance, potentially around 2033-2035 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>.

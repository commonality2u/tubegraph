The world is currently experiencing a significant geopolitical evolution, moving from a unipolar or bipolar distribution of power to a more multipolar one. This shift, which arguably began in the early 2010s, signals the end of American hegemony as the sole dominant global force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While the U.S. remains the most powerful country, it no longer possesses the "preponderance of power" to unilaterally compel other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This [[US and global geopolitics | multipolar world]] order is characterized by several key aspects:
*   **Increased Conflict Frequency**: Without one or two dominant powers to maintain equilibrium, conflicts are more likely to arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, not all conflicts hold significant macro or global investor relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Technological and Industrial Innovation**: Geopolitical competition drives governments to invest more in technological breakthroughs, infrastructure development, and domestic capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Higher Volatility**: Periods of [[economic_implications_of_deglobalization_and_energy_policies | deglobalization]] and conflict tend to exhibit more frequent volatile events, although broad market volatility can be lower due to more consistent trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## [[Populism and Globalization Trends | Populism]] and its Impact on Economic Policy

The shift to a [[US and global geopolitics | multipolar world]] is closely linked to the rise of [[Populism and Globalization Trends | populism]], which began around 2009-2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This phenomenon is largely a function of wealth inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. [[Populism and Economic Implications | Populist]] leaders, such as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, capitalized on a generational push against the existing order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

A direct consequence of [[Populism and Economic Implications | populism]] is the move towards [[Political and Economic Implications of Protectionism | protectionism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The idea that "people are local but corporations are global" drives a focus on domestic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Shift in Economic Frameworks

This era sees a pendulum swing away from the "laissez-faire capitalism" and "Washington Consensus" that characterized the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Instead, there's a movement towards "deist capitalism," or what has been termed the "Buenos Aires consensus," involving more state intervention and fiscal spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The U.S. experience in the 1960s and 1970s, with "Great Society" programs and Vietnam War spending, led to significant fiscal looseness and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This historical parallel highlights a period of increasing [[Political Influence on Economic Policies | political influence on economic policies]] where fiscal stimulus was used to address domestic social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Current policy makers, having witnessed secular stagnation post-Great Financial Crisis, became complacent, leading to excessive fiscal spending after the pandemic and subsequent inflationary outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Despite these profound shifts, long-term inflation expectations have remained largely anchored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This disconnect suggests a significant mispricing in the market, with assets like gold indicating that long-term inflation expectations might be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## [[Political and Economic Implications of Protectionism | Protectionism]] in Practice

The rise of [[Political and Economic Implications of Protectionism | protectionism]] is evident in U.S. trade policy. Donald Trump initiated a nationalist, [[Political and Economic Implications of Protectionism | protectionist]] movement, using it as a tool to secure trade deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. His political standing allows him to pursue such deals, even with countries like China, with little domestic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

This doesn't mean a return to pre-1990s globalization, but rather a redesign of supply chains to be more resilient, even if less efficient. This involves increased capital expenditure (capex) and a focus on domestic capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. For example, Chinese companies are already engaging in "enemy shoring," investing directly in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico to satisfy American national security priorities and avoid direct U.S. tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

## Global and Regional Dynamics

### Europe's Geopolitical Awakening

Europe has been significantly impacted by [[geopolitical and domestic risks | geopolitical and domestic risks]], particularly the energy crisis of 2022 and Russian aggression in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. These events have served as a "wake-up call," forcing Europe to recognize its reliance on the U.S. and the need to develop its own geopolitical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>.

Europe is taking steps towards energy security, building import terminals for liquefied natural gas (LNG) at an accelerated pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Overinvestment in LNG supply globally suggests that Europe will soon benefit from cheap electricity and a buyer's market for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. This also supports a push for more nuclear power in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

There is a growing trend towards greater integration within Europe to form a more cohesive [[geopolitics and global financial systems | geopolitical actor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>. This includes increased investment in European defense companies and Industrials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>. The existential risk to the Euro's viability, a concern for investors in the past, has also dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.

### Russia, China, and the Global South

The U.S. has attempted to create a bipolar structure where Europe, Japan, South Korea, and India align against Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. However, this "foreign policy propaganda" has largely failed because the rest of the world does not view China and Russia as true allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

China, despite its proclaimed "endless friendship" with Russia, has maintained an arms embargo and equivocated in its support for Russia, even acknowledging Ukrainian sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. China aims to maintain strong commercial relations with Europe and other regions to secure technology and drive a wedge between the U.S. and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

Countries in the Global South, including Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil, are increasingly aware that neither China nor the U.S. possesses the overwhelming power of Cold War superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. This encourages a "geopolitically promiscuous" approach, allowing them to benefit from relationships with multiple powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>.

The world is characterized by fluid relationships rather than clear alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This means countries like France can engage in significant commercial relations with China, which would have been impossible in a truly bipolar world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Taiwan and China's Domestic Focus

For the next five years, China is unlikely to invade Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. This is due to:
*   **Domestic Economic Challenges**: China faces a period of "secular stagnation" and needs to revive its domestic economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. This makes them more dependent on external demand and less willing to risk global isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:38">[01:03:38]</a>.
*   **Lessons from Ukraine**: China has observed the Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, particularly the impact of private sector withdrawals, which would hit China's economy far harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.
*   **No Imminent "Clock"**: The Chinese Communist Party can maintain legitimacy without immediately resolving the Taiwan issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>. The risk-reward balance currently disfavors an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>.

## Investment Implications

In this [[US and global geopolitics | multipolar world]], investors should consider:
*   **Commodities and Hard Assets**: Redesigning supply chains and increased capex will drive demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **Government Spending Beneficiaries**: Investments in infrastructure, national defense, healthcare, and housing are likely to perform well due to increased state involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **Value Investing**: High-quality businesses with strong free cash flow (DCF value) are favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **Regional Rebalancing**: While the U.S. has been a dominant investment focus, other regions like Europe and Japan are expected to outperform in the coming years, not due to U.S. decline, but due to shifting macro setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>.
*   **[[the_role_of_hedging_and_portfolio_protection | Strategic Asset Allocation]]**: It's crucial to get secular trends right, but be aware that short-term volatility (1-3 years) can still lead to significant losses if not managed carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

The U.S. election is currently a major short-term focus for investors, acting as a "macro black hole" that distorts market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. The Federal Reserve's actions are also influenced by the desire to avoid [[geopolitical and domestic risks | left-tail risks]] ahead of the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>. Periods of [[Populism and Economic Implications | populism]] and fiscal spending in election years historically show very strong market returns, but these often occur within broader periods of flat or negative real returns for the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

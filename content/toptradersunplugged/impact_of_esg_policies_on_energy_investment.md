The [[Impact of ESG and geopolitical factors on natural resource markets | ESG movement]] has significantly distorted capital allocation in the United States and Europe over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This has led to constrained capital flow into traditional energy industries such as oil, gas, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Distortive Effect on Traditional Energy
Despite rising energy prices, [[Impact of government policy on markets | ESG pressures]] continue to prevent oil and gas companies from significantly increasing their drilling budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Capital budgets in traditional energy sectors were down in some cases by 70% from pre-COVID levels and are not rebounding as quickly as anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. For example, even with oil prices hitting $100 per barrel, many companies are not increasing drilling activity due to these persistent ESG pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This has contributed to a "full-blown energy crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Challenges in Renewable Energy
While proponents of renewables believed that rising fossil fuel prices would make wind and solar more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, the opposite has occurred. Write-offs of wind and solar assets are increasing because manufacturers are struggling to produce them amidst the current energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This challenges the notion that [[Sustainability and challenges in renewable energy investments | ESG mandates]] would provide abundant, cheap, and uninterruptible power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI)
A key concept in understanding energy systems is the [[Energy return on energy invested EROEI | EROEI]], which measures the usable energy produced relative to the energy consumed to produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Historical Context:**
    *   For approximately 16 centuries, human society's energy economy, based on food and wood, had an EROEI of 5 to 10:1 (societally closer to 5:1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. This low EROEI meant almost no surplus energy, hindering economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
    *   The shift to coal around 1650 in the UK, due to wood depletion, provided an EROEI of 15:1 initially (now 30:1), generating significant surplus energy and exploding growth rates in population and real GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
    *   Modern fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) have an EROEI of about 30:1, which enabled the modern world and exponential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.
*   **Renewables EROEI:**
    *   Wind energy has an EROEI of 5 to 10:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
    *   Solar energy has an EROEI of 1 to 5:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.
    *   These low EROEIs, similar to pre-industrial levels, leave little surplus energy for growth and would require a "huge amount of energy" to produce more energy, taking a "one-time hit to our quality of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a>.
    *   The calculation of EROEI for renewables must account for intermittency, requiring redundancies (building multiple windmills), battery storage for daily variations (lithium-ion batteries are very energy-intensive to manufacture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>, and a yet-unsolved solution for seasonal variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.

### Cost Dynamics and Moore's Law Misconception
There's a misconception that wind and solar costs will continue to fall indefinitely due to technological advancements, similar to Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.
*   The dramatic cost reduction in wind and solar over the last decade was primarily due to two unique factors: the lowest cost of capital in 4,000 years and a 90% fall in the price of all forms of energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.
*   Windmills and solar panels require significant capital and energy for manufacturing (e.g., steel, cement, carbon fiber, copper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. For example, one Permian shale well generates the same usable energy as ten 300-foot tall windmills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>.
*   With rising energy prices and increasing cost of capital, the costs of these "super energy intensive and super capital intensive" technologies are unlikely to continue falling and may even rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

### Supply Chain and Environmental Conflicts
The push for renewables faces environmental challenges beyond carbon emissions:
*   **Battery Metals:** There is a scarcity of battery-grade nickel and other materials needed for electric vehicle batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.
*   **Nickel Processing:** Processing nickel laterite, a common form of nickel, into battery-grade nickel is one of the most CO2-intensive processes globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.
*   **Environmental Trade-offs:** A proposed nickel project in Indonesia involves clear-cutting dense rainforest, which sequesters CO2, and then processing the nickel with high CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>. This means a net increase in CO2 emissions compared to leaving the forest intact, leading to a "greens vs. greens" debate within environmental groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.
*   **Waste:** Lithium-ion batteries are flammable and often end up in toxic landfills after about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

## Shift Towards Nuclear Energy
There is a growing recognition and "frank discussion" about nuclear power as a viable energy source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.
*   **High EROEI & Low Carbon:** Nuclear power offers an EROEI of 100:1, significantly higher than hydrocarbons (30:1) and renewables, and ideally generates no carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. This combination places it "off the frontier" in terms of efficiency and environmental benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Safety:** Nuclear power is considered "extremely safe" on any metric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>.
*   **Policy Shift:** Europe has added nuclear to its "green taxonomy," and countries like France and the UK have ambitious new programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. China and India are also heavily investing in new nuclear reactor programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **Cost Overruns:** Nuclear reactor construction in the West has seen significant cost overruns and delays, partly due to increased security and safety standards post-Fukushima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>.
    *   **Waste Management:** Nuclear waste is manageable and addressable, with new small modular reactor designs producing dramatically less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. Yucca Mountain in the US and existing practices in France offer solutions for long-term storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
    *   **Small Modular Reactors (SMRs):** New designs like SMRs aim to reduce costs and address "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) opposition by being smaller and modular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:11">[00:56:11]</a>. However, historically, energy production benefits from scale, making the efficiency of smaller reactors an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

## Broader Economic Implications
The period of cheap money and cheap energy has ended, leading to [[Economic implications of deglobalization and energy policies | malinvestment]] in energy-intensive technologies with low energy returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>. The current energy crisis was foundational even before the Ukraine conflict, rooted in diverting capital from efficient hydrocarbon development to inefficient wind and solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>. This requires significant reinvestment in oil and gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:57">[01:05:57]</a>.

*   **Deglobalization:** The shift towards deglobalization, evident in supply chain disruptions during COVID, is likely to extend to raw materials. This will require greater redundancy and local security in raw material supply chains, potentially leading to increased demand and higher prices for resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:20">[01:06:20]</a>. This mirrors the commodity bear market seen after the collapse of the Soviet Union, suggesting an opposite effect now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:21">[01:07:21]</a>.
*   **Inflation and Inventory Hoarding:** Rising commodity prices and inflationary expectations can incentivize inventory hoarding, further increasing demand for raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:14">[01:08:14]</a>. This marks a departure from the 40-year disinflationary period and hyper-financialization, requiring a reconsideration of the market playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:42">[01:08:42]</a>.
*   **Economic Growth Threshold:** Historically, when energy expenditures reach about 10% of Western GDP (specifically the US), it acts as a "dramatic drag" on economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:34">[01:11:34]</a>. At $150 oil, this threshold is crossed, potentially causing the economy to "stall" as too much of the system's productive capacity is directed towards simply making energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.

## Current Investment Landscape
Despite recent increases in commodity and energy stock prices, the sector remains historically undervalued. Energy's weighting in the S&P 500, for example, is currently around 3.9%, compared to its long-term average of 10% and a peak of 30% in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:08">[01:14:08]</a>. This suggests that the current rally in resource markets is "far from over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>. The current decade is likely to be characterized by commodity shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>.

## October 2022 Market Summary

October 2022 proved to be a notable month, marked by significant events and market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Key observations include:
*   The short tenure of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Significant drops in tech giants: Meta/Facebook stock was down about 75% from its high, and Amazon predicted its slowest sales growth, leading to a 21% fall in after-hours trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   US mortgage rates topping seven percent, the first time in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Fed officials maintained a hawkish stance, laying groundwork for interest rates to reach 5% by March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, which economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect to lead the US and the globe into a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   A significant US export ban of microchips to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Market movements throughout October saw "energetic bear market rallies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. A choppy recovery rally occurred in risk assets since mid-month, with a positive reaction to seemingly bad news (e.g., CPI release) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. There's also a noticeable shift in optimism around technology stocks, with some companies scaling back on investments like driverless cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Concerns about liquidity in the Treasury market have arisen, with more extreme moves and wider bid-offer spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

In terms of performance for trend following strategies:
*   October saw a close call between finishing the month in the red or black for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   The first three weeks largely followed trend-following themes, driven by long bonds moving down and currencies depreciating against the US Dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   A Wall Street Journal article suggesting the Fed might slow down rate hikes ignited a rally in assets like bonds (up 5 big points from low, but still down 23 big points since July) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, and equities (up about 10% from October lows) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   Equity markets are showing more volatility than trend following returns on a monthly basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Energy markets were also interesting, with US natural gas down about 15% for the month and Dutch natural gas down 66% since its late August peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   CTA performance for October was generally flat to slightly down, but still positive for the year:
    *   BTOP 50: pretty flat for the month, up 19.6% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   Societe Generale CTA Index: down 26 basis points for the month, up 25.75% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   Societe Generale Trend Index: down 75 basis points for the month, up about 34.5% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    *   Societe Generale Short-Term Traders Index: down 32 basis points for the month, up 12.6% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   In contrast, the MSCI World was up 6% for the month (down almost 22% for the year), the S&P Total Return Index was up 6.8% (down 19.6% for the year), and the World Government Bond Index was down 10 basis points for the month, marking its first such drop in a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## [[optimal_portfolio_allocation_strategies | Optimal Portfolio Allocation]]: The Role of Trend Following

The question of the "right allocation" to trend following within a portfolio is topical, especially after a period of strong performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Historical Benefits of Trend Following

Historically, adding managed futures and trend following to a multi-asset, equity, or 60/40 portfolio has shown significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>:
*   Increased return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   Reduced volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   Reduced maximum drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   Improved skew and Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   Even in the past decade (2010s), while absolute return might have been reduced due to strong equity performance, it still improved the Sharpe ratio and reduced drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.
*   Currently, rerunning the analysis from 2000, adding trend following to equity or multi-asset portfolios increases return, reduces volatility, and improves the Sharpe ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

### Challenges with Backward-Looking Optimization

Optimizing [[optimal_portfolio_allocation_strategies | allocation to Trend following]] is highly sensitive to the chosen time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. For example:
*   An optimization maximizing the Sharpe ratio from 2000 suggests a 48% allocation to trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.
*   Running the same analysis in 2019 (for 2000-2019) suggested a 37% allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.
*   However, for the decade of 2010-2019, an optimization would not have allocated to trend following due to the superior risk-return profile of bonds and equities in that specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

This highlights the limitations of purely backward-looking optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Forward-Looking [[global_macroeconomic_strategies_and_asset_allocation | Asset Allocation]] and Macro Resilience

A paper by analysts at GIC (Singapore's Sovereign wealth fund) in conjunction with MSCI, titled "Building Balanced Portfolios for the Long Run: A New Framework for Incorporating Macro Resilience in [[asset_allocation_decisionmaking | Asset Allocation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, proposes a forward-looking approach to portfolio construction based on how assets respond to different macro environments and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

The paper identifies two key shifts:
1.  The rise of private assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.
2.  A changed macro environment with more uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

It contrasts with the past two to three decades, which were dominated by demand shocks that supported a negative correlation between bonds and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. The recent past has seen more supply shocks (e.g., COVID, Ukraine war), which will impact markets differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. The MSCI model is used to predict asset class performance under five key longer-term risks (demand, supply, policy, trend growth, real rate shocks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

Interestingly, this framework suggests moving away from the traditional 60/40 portfolio and including allocations to private equity and real estate, and TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), but notably, no allocation to trend following or managed futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. This is curious, as trend following is often seen as boosting portfolio robustness and adaptability to different shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

### The Enduring Value of Trend Following

Despite the omission in some forward-looking models, historical evidence, such as papers dating back to John Lindner in 1983, consistently confirm the benefits of adding trend following to a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Consultants, while recognizing that models suggest higher allocations for trend following than typical pension funds consider, often do not present this to clients due to perceived unconventionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

When analyzing portfolio construction based on extreme starting points (e.g., before/after the tech bubble burst or the Global Financial Crisis), the allocation to trend following remains the most consistent part of the portfolio, while equity and bond allocations shift significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. This suggests that trend following should be a core allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:18">[00:29:18]</a>. A rule of thumb of 20-25% allocation is often considered sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

Furthermore, a significant portion (80-90%) of capital in trend following strategies is not used for margin purposes, meaning it sits in cash and can earn a decent yield, thus automatically benefiting from rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## Shifting Macroeconomic Landscape and Risks

Many believe we are at the cusp of a new era, transitioning from a distinct economic and market period (1989-2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

### The End of an Era (1989-2019)

The period from 1989 to 2019, labeled the "era of markets" by McKinsey Global Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>, was characterized by:
*   Disinflationary trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.
*   Low unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.
*   Asset markets at multi-year highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   However, underlying issues included record high central bank balance sheets, record debt levels, rising geopolitical concerns, and global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>.

### The New Era of Volatility and Supply Shocks

"Earthquakes" like COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine, along with rising geopolitical risk and energy scarcity concerns, are setting the stage for a new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. This new period is expected to be defined by increased volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

> "We're going from the great moderation to the great volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

The shift from demand shocks (where equities go down and bonds go up) to more prevalent supply shocks means asset responses will differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. Supply shocks are physical and play out more slowly over time, making them harder to quantify and keep at the forefront of investors' minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.

### Unpredictable Inflation

The current environment is characterized by "unpredictable inflation," where prices can move both up and down, driving markets in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. This makes fundamentally driven [[investment_strategies_and_risks | investments]] incredibly challenging, if not impossible, suggesting that rules-based strategies may have the upper hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21">[00:47:21]</a>.

## Insights on Central Banking and Market Dynamics

### Bill White's Perspective: Complex Adaptive Systems

William (Bill) White, an economist who has worked at the OECD, Bank of England, Bank of Canada, and the BIS, provides a unique perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. He holds significant weight in global economic circles, with some suggesting he should have received the Nobel Prize for his warnings about systemic leverage and financial crisis risks in 2007, contrasting with Ben Bernanke's theoretical model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>.

White's core philosophy is that markets and the economy function as complex adaptive systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>. He believes the system is inherently unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>, and there is a "hubris of central bankers" who believe they have solved or fully understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:14">[00:51:14]</a>. This perspective highlights the need for adaptability in [[investing_strategies_and_risk_management | investing strategies and risk management]], a quality inherent in trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.

### Unforeseen Consequences of Quantitative Easing (QE)

White authored a significant piece 10 years ago titled "The Ultra Easy Monetary Policy and the Unintended Consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49">[00:52:49]</a>. His insights are now playing out as central banks withdraw stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:21">[00:54:21]</a>.

Recent market events underscore these consequences:
*   Extreme volatility in Gilts and TIPS markets in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   Central banks are increasingly having to intervene:
    *   Bank of Japan intervening in Dollar-Yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
    *   Local Chinese banks selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.
    *   Janet Yellen expressing concerns about liquidity in the Treasury market due to larger moves and bid-offer spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.

### Liquidity Concerns

The J.P. Morgan market index of market liquidity is at its lowest levels in years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:17">[00:54:17]</a>. A drought of liquidity is a significant risk, particularly as traditionally liquid markets can become illiquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. In such environments, Futures markets generally remain the most liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>, reinforcing the argument for on-exchange trading of liquid futures in [[investing_strategies and risk management | trend following strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current macroeconomic environment, characterized by shifting paradigms, unpredictable inflation, and the playing out of long-term consequences of monetary policies, highlights the challenges for traditional [[asset_allocation_decisionmaking | asset allocation]]. The consistent benefits and adaptable nature of trend following strategies make them a crucial component for building robust and resilient portfolios in an increasingly volatile and complex world.

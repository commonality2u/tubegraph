The [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]] was an experiment created by veteran hedge fund manager [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] in the 1980s to prove that trading could be taught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Dennis acted as the original mentor to the "Turtles," including Brian Proctor of EMC Capital Advisors and Jerry Parker of Chesapeake Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. The program focused on teaching participants to trade systematically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>, emphasizing strict adherence to rules and disciplined risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:55">[02:58:55]</a>.

## Core Philosophy and Principles

A fundamental principle of the [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]] was strict adherence to rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. Participants were taught to follow a systematic approach, which included specific exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:01">[08:59:01]</a> and avoiding discretionary trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:01">[09:39:01]</a>.

### Risk Management

[[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | Risk management]] was a key concept taught in the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. Key takeaways for the Turtles included:
*   Strict risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   Not over-trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   Taking numerous losing trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>.
*   Not exiting winning trades until the trend is confirmed to be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.

Jerry Parker noted that while his approach has remained consistent with the overall [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | Turtle Trading philosophy]], it has evolved to be more [[longterm_trading_systems | longer-term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Challenges

Since the [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]] concluded, the market landscape has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Volatility Targeting**: Many successful CTAs have adopted constant volatility targeting, aiming for specific levels like 10%, 15%, or 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] admits he never understood the issue with volatility, suggesting clients can modify it themselves by investing less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. Jerry Parker has no interest in volatility targeting, viewing it as a sophisticated way of taking profits too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Market Changes**: Extreme trends were more common in the past, with recent years seeing fewer such trends and a contraction of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. Performance for many managers has been under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Intervention**: Brian Proctor believes that central bank intervention and government policies have reduced liquidity in many markets, making it more difficult for professional money managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.
*   **"System Failure" vs. Lack of Trends**: Jerry Parker attributes low returns to a lack of trending markets rather than system failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. He also expresses concern that volatility targeting among large CTAs contributes to market crashes when trends reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

### Adaptation vs. Rules
There is an ongoing debate about whether trading strategies should adapt to changing markets or stick to core principles. A common belief suggests that any investment strategy not adapting to changes will experience diminishing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>. However, Jerry Parker argues that his [[longterm_trading_systems | long-term]] trend-following entries and exits naturally adapt to changing environments and economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:25:00">[32:25:00]</a>. He maintains that staying too true to the original [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]] rules may have hindered business growth, but ultimately provides a better experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] believes the idea that rules *must* change is "vastly overstated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:22:00">[34:22:00]</a>, emphasizing the enduring truth that "the trend is your friend" and "the rules are your guardian angel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>.

## Reflections on the Program

### Richard Dennis's Perspective
[[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] expresses no regrets about the [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]], although he is unhappy with those who profit from it online without involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. He didn't have specific numerical expectations for the program's outcome, viewing it simply as another "large trade" or risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. He acknowledges that it's harder to teach objective trading today and isn't sure if the same program would work again due to truncated trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.

### The Turtles' Takeaways
Both Jerry Parker and Brian Proctor learned invaluable lessons from the [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]].
*   **Jerry Parker**: Emphasizes the "magical time" of learning and the desire to continue managing money for [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. He highlights the unparalleled training and support they received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Brian Proctor**: Stresses the importance of strict [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | risk management]] and continuously looking for new systems or blending different timeframes to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>. He highlights that the program removed psychological pressure by not risking their own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Trading as a Business
Jerry Parker raised the question of whether "proper trading is a real business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>, suggesting that focusing solely on trading rules might not align with building a large business that satisfies client demands like volatility targeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. He noted that some larger firms had early investors who helped build infrastructure and focus on "sales alpha" as much as "trading alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>.

## Enduring Legacy

Despite market changes and challenges, the principles taught in the [[the_turtle_trading_program | Turtle Trading Program]] continue to be relevant. Brian Proctor maintains that trend-following "does work" and will continue to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. The Turtles' experience underscores the importance of discipline, [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | risk management]], and consistent application of a well-defined strategy.

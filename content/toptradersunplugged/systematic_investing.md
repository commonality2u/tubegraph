The **Systematic Investor Series** with Richard Brennan and Nils Castle Blossom explores [[systematic_investing_strategies | systematic investing]] and aims to provide a pulse of global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. [[systematic_investing_strategies | Systematic investing]] is presented as a dependable, consistent, yet often overlooked investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

The series also includes a CTA Series featuring decision-makers from large CTA firms, providing a snapshot of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Observations from this series indicate a significant dispersion in the industry regarding the definition of 'trend' and the methods deployed to target trend and other arbitrage opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This diversity is considered beneficial for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. There's a tendency among more firms to broaden their strategy beyond just trend following to become more absolute return-focused, potentially in response to client demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Core Concepts in Systematic Investing

The discussion often delves into the quantitative analysis of price data to develop trading models and how to avoid issues like overfitting and underfitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. These are crucial aspects of what quantitative modelers deal with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

### Signal and Noise

When analyzing price data, investors typically look for patterns that positively correlate with systems designed to extract profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This desired pattern is called a **signal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

*   **Signal**: For a trend follower, a signal represents a directionally trending or divergent price series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. For a mean reversion investor, it's a repeating oscillation or convergent price series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.
*   **Noise**: This refers to all other price patterns that interfere with the primary signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. Noise can be random price patterns or even an opposing signal (e.g., a convergent pattern is noise to a trend follower) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

A profitable outcome occurs when a system positively correlates with the price pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. An effective trading system must be optimally "fit" to the signal it targets to generate optimal profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. This concept of fitting models to price data is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

A **high signal-to-noise ratio** in price data means that signals (materially trending price series) are more frequent relative to background noise, providing more opportunities for profit than loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. Conversely, a low signal-to-noise ratio leads to poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

The primary problem remains: how to separate genuine signals from good luck or random outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Overfitting, Underfitting, and Optimal Fitting

*   **Optimally Fit Trading System**: One that preferentially responds to signals in price data and not to noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This provides confidence that future signals will be exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.
*   **Overfit Trading System**: This extracts both signal and noise from price series because it responds to any price patterns that lead to profitable outcomes, including those based purely on luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:56">[00:42:56]</a>. This is a common problem in data mining processes where the system trains itself to noise and signal to meet predefined objectives (e.g., minimum CAGR, maximum drawdown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Overfit systems tend to degrade quickly when applied to future, unseen price series because there is no enduring edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:41">[00:44:41]</a>.
*   **Underfit Trading System**: A model where the trading system fails to optimally extract the signal, leaving much of the signal unexploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. While inefficient, an underfit model is generally preferable to an overfit model when developing trend following systems, especially when targeting unique outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. An overfit model tailored to historical trends might miss future trends if their nature changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>.

### Selection Bias

[[Systematic investing strategies | Selection bias]] enters the trading process when choosing from competing alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. If, for instance, a trader selects the best-performing model from several alternatives, that model might be performing well due to chance (trading random noise) rather than exploiting a real, causative driver in the price series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>. This bias is unavoidable because models must be selected, but it's crucial to be aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.

## Methods to Reduce Overfitting

Unlike traditional methods (Monte Carlo, walk forward analysis) that may not be appropriate for the sporadic nature of trends, several principles can help reduce overfitting in trend following:

1.  **Design-First Logic**: This involves applying "golden rules" defined by logic, not statistics, to create a system capable of exploiting the desired edge (e.g., "cut losses short, let profits run") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This approach immediately eliminates the chance of overfitting from the iteration process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>.
2.  **Simple Models with Few Parameters**: Also known as "loose pants models," these are less over-optimized to historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>. They can capture opportunities from a greater variation in possible trend forms, allowing for a larger sample size of exploitable signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. More precise models with more parameters tend to be prescriptive and overfit to a particular form of signal, missing alternative patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>.
3.  **Visual Mapping Process**: Instead of relying solely on statistical metrics (e.g., best Sharpe ratio, CAGR), visually map the trade outcomes (equity curve) against the price data time series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>. This allows direct observation of how the equity curve responds to trending periods versus non-trending (noisy) periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>. If the equity curve rises during non-trending periods, it indicates overfitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>. This method helps select models that are least overfit and correlate with the intended design logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
4.  **Multi-Market Testing**: Apply a single [[systematic_trading_strategies | trend following model]] across all markets in a diversified portfolio, assuming universal applicability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>. This significantly increases the sample size for analysis, which is crucial given the low number of outlier trades in a single market's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>. This approach eliminates overfitting to a single market and maximizes fitting to the characteristics of multiple markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.
5.  **Use All Data**: Avoid separating data into in-sample and out-of-sample sets. Using all available data for backtesting is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>. Robustness in [[systematic_investment_strategies | systematic investment strategies]] is less about sample size and more about exposing the model to a variety of different market regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>.

## Challenges and Misconceptions

Despite the principles of simplicity, [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | systematic investing and trend following]] is not easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:37">[01:09:37]</a>. There are many moving parts, including data handling, rule application, and parameter selections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. The belief that it is simple, often seen on social media or in some publications, can be misleading and lead to underestimation of the expertise required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:51">[01:09:51]</a>. Successful firms in this space have employed smart and extraordinarily talented people in research and execution for decades to deliver above-average returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The data supports that it is one of the most robust investment strategies available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

### Position Sizing in Systematic Investing

One aspect of [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading systems]] is [[position_sizing_in_systematic_investing | position sizing]]. One approach involves adopting a set dollar risk per trade, for example, 0.5% of the realized equity balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:51">[01:33:51]</a>. Stops are then defined using an Average True Range (ATR) with a multiple (e.g., 4-5 times a 25-day ATR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>. This defines the position size, ensuring a known dollar risk at entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:30">[01:14:30]</a>. A trailing stop, potentially with a looser multiple (e.g., 5 ATR), is then adopted to allow profit to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>.

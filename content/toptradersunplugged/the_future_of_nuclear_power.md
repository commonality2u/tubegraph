The future of nuclear power is a topic of increasing discussion, particularly in the context of global energy crises and the need for efficient, low-carbon energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

## Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI)

The concept of Energy Return on Energy Invested (EROEI) is crucial when evaluating energy sources, measuring the usable energy produced versus the energy consumed to produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. For most of human history, energy sources like food and wood had an EROEI of 5 to 10 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:54">[01:57:54]</a>. The shift to coal in the 17th century increased this to about 15 to 1 initially, leading to significant economic growth and the proliferation of cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. Modern fossil fuels (oil and natural gas) boast an EROEI of approximately 30 to 1, enabling the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:40">[02:22:40]</a>.

[[The future of nuclear energy and technological developments | Nuclear power]] stands out with an EROEI of 100 units out for one unit in, making it significantly more efficient than hydrocarbons (30 to 1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>. This high efficiency positions nuclear power as an outlier, offering a combination of high energy return and no carbon emissions, a trade-off typically seen in other energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.

In contrast, [[Challenges of renewable energy | renewable energy]] sources like wind and solar have a much lower EROEI. When considering the necessary redundancies and battery backups to address their intermittency, wind's EROEI drops to between 5 and 10 to 1, and solar's to between 1 and 5 to 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>. Historically, such low EROEI levels have left no surplus energy for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:37">[02:31:37]</a>.

## Safety and Environmental Concerns

Critics of nuclear power often point to nuclear waste as a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:20">[00:53:20]</a>. However, nuclear waste is manageable and addressable, especially with new designs for small modular reactors (SMRs) which produce significantly less waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. While radioactive, it is primarily a security issue rather than an inherent danger when handled properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. France manages its nuclear waste effectively, and the U.S. has a strong option in Yucca Mountain, though it has been controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

In terms of safety, nuclear power is considered extremely safe by many metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>. Although historical nuclear disasters are remembered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>, the nuclear reactors built in the 1960s and 1970s are largely still operating safely and efficiently today, with many permits being extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

## Cost and Construction Challenges

The cost and cost overruns associated with building nuclear reactors are significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. Following the Fukushima disaster, security and safety standards were changed globally, leading to substantial costs and delays for ongoing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. For example, a billion dollars worth of concrete for a foundation might have to be torn up and restarted if it didn't meet new exacting standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. In the West, the ability to build large-scale nuclear reactors on time and budget is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

## Technological Developments and Global Outlook

### Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are a new development aimed at addressing cost and scalability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. SMRs promise smaller, modular designs that can be manufactured in a central location and deployed widely, potentially driving down costs through standardization and economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. They also incorporate new safety designs that are intended to be safer and more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:38">[00:56:38]</a>. Proponents hope they will face less "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) opposition due to their smaller size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

### Global Adoption
Globally, there's a growing recognition of nuclear power's role:
*   **Europe** has added nuclear power to its green taxonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>.
*   **France** and the **UK** have ambitious new programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   Even **Germany**, which has decommissioned many plants, is seeing a new discussion emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:34">[00:42:34]</a>.
*   **China** has a massive new build reactor program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>, and **India** is expected to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>.

China is currently a leader in manufacturing conventional nuclear reactors, while the West's skill set in this area is less clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>.

## Uranium Market

The uranium market is characterized by a small universe of producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. The two main producing companies are Cameco (Canada) and Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan), alongside smaller development stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>. Uranium prices bottomed at $19 a pound, but most development projects require $75 a pound to be viable for funding and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. Current spot prices are in the mid-$50s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. This market structure, with only a duopoly of major producers, led to a situation where even flagship mines struggled to be profitable at the bear market lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite historical challenges and public perception, there's growing optimism that embracing [[Potential of nuclear energy and new technologies | nuclear power]] could lead to a significant step change in energy efficiency, potentially ushering in a period of great prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>. This shift is seen as crucial for addressing carbon emissions while providing reliable and abundant energy.

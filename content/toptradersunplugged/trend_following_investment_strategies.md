[[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] was identified as the investment strategy that outperformed all others in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>. Russell Koganka, Chief Investment Officer at Man AHL, describes it as one of the most straightforward and elegant strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:02">[06:40:02]</a>.

## Philosophy and Strategy at Man AHL
Man AHL is a systematic alternative manager that runs many different types of funds and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. While its heritage is in [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]], it also manages Quant Equity and long-only risk-managed strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. The core tenets of Man AHL's approach are that all its activities are 100% systematic and active in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

The fundamental belief within AHL is that markets offer small opportunities and inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. To capitalize on these, strategies must be able to adjust positions and trade efficiently, avoiding performance drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. A significant part of success in the systematic space is discerning not just what to trade, but also what not to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. When inefficiencies are found, they are exploited as efficiently and diversely as possible across numerous regions and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The combination of efficient trading systems and broad diversification transforms small edges into meaningful returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

Man AHL's approach is primarily [[trend_following_investment_strategies | Trend following]], supplemented by other strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. The goal is to maximize expected return for a given risk target, which involves considering the set of markets, signals, grouping of signals, execution, and risk limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Why Markets Trend and Why [[trend_following_strategies | Trend Following]] Works
Russell Koganka identifies three primary reasons why markets tend to trend, leading to autocorrelation in price movements:
1.  **Information Diffusion**: Information does not spread instantly but takes time to diffuse into a marketplace, meaning markets are not 100% efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. A price might move only partially initially, taking time to fully propagate the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Autocorrelated Market Drivers**: Factors influencing market returns, such as interest rates, inflation readings, or economic data, tend to move slowly and in the same direction over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
3.  **Behavioral Factors**: Human nature plays a compelling and enduring role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:18]</a>. For example, people tend to wait for better prices when assets are rising and quickly accept bids when prices are falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. This behavioral aspect dates back thousands of years, as evidenced by ancient records of wheat prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. [[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] is considered primarily a behavioral phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

For non-[[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] strategies, inefficiencies can stem from different sources, such as trading or liquidity inefficiencies, where demand for an asset doesn't justify its price movement, leading to price reversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Fundamental strategies might exploit information inefficiencies, where certain information is not yet fully reflected in the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

## Crisis Alpha and Risk Properties
While [[trend_following_strategies | trend followers]] didn't initially design their strategies to perform well specifically during negative equity markets, the 2008 financial crisis highlighted their ability to provide "crisis alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. Institutional investors value both absolute return and the ability to diversify or perform well during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. [[Trend following strategies | Trend following]] naturally offers this due to its responsiveness to sustained market panics over weeks and months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. More reactive systems are more likely to deliver positive returns in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

### Digestibility for Investors
Man AHL aims to improve the expected returns of basic [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] without altering its inherent risk or defensive properties, making it more digestible for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This ensures investors have the "stomach" to remain invested even through periods of poor performance, so they are positioned when market conditions become conducive to trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

The objective of making the strategy more "digestible" does not inherently trade off against crisis alpha or convexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. A very slow [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] system might not have excellent tail properties in a crisis because it takes too long to switch positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>. To improve crisis protection, a system needs to be more reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. Different types of crises can lead to varying performance, and generally, the more reactive a system, the more likely it is to deliver positive returns in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>.

## Replication and Evolution of Strategies
Replicating past performance in [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] and CTA strategies is relatively easy, especially in backtests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>. However, it is difficult to replicate sophisticated strategies successfully in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>. Modern strategies have been refined, added new features, and adjusted execution profiles over the past 20 years, making them more effective than basic models from that era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. While return streams can be modeled to explain variance, true replication requires replicating positions, ideally ahead of time, and trading them efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>.

Research and continuous improvement are crucial in systematic investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. While backtests of new features often make systems appear better, the true measure is their live performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>. Minor tweaks to a [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] system, such as adjusting speeds or market weights, do not make a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:17:00">[32:17:00]</a>. However, adding genuinely diversifying markets and models that are fundamentally different can significantly improve performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. Paradoxically, in 2022, simpler, slower [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] systems that held short bond positions for the entire year performed exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>.

Historically, faster [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] performed better in the 1980s and 1990s, but there has been a degradation over time, leading the industry to shift towards slower speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>. This can be attributed to markets becoming more efficient, reducing "information leakage" that drove short-term [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:39:00">[34:39:00]</a>. Changes in market microstructure, combined with good analytics and intuition, guide shifts in system profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>.

### Execution as Alpha
Effective execution is vital as it allows for the harvesting of a richer set of alphas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>. For very basic, slow [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] systems, execution quality may not matter much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>. However, sophisticated execution systems enable the introduction of diverse alpha sources around the edges of a strategy, improving expected returns while maintaining overall risk properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. For example, insights from short-term trading models (hours to days) can be used to adapt the trade profile of slower systems, optimizing timing and exploiting more alpha at a larger scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:16:00">[37:16:00]</a>.

### Dynamic Position Sizing
While returns in markets are difficult to predict, risk is much easier to predict and is highly time-varying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:21:00">[40:21:00]</a>. Dynamic position scaling is crucial for controlling risk, especially given that volatility can increase dramatically over short periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>. This allows a system to remain "in the game" during stressful markets, which are often the periods when [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] systems perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39:00">[43:39:00]</a>. Without dynamic management, a market swing might trigger a stop-loss, removing exposure at a critical time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>.

## Managing Drawdowns and Market Context
Periods of struggle for [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] are not due to changes in information dissemination or behavioral biases, but rather due to changes in market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:50:00">[44:50:00]</a>. During the 2010s, in liquid markets (e.g., G10 currencies), [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] underperformed not because reversals worsened, but because trends themselves were less strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:24:00">[47:24:00]</a>. This was hypothesized to be due to highly compressed markets, with central banks acting as a backstop and implementing loose monetary policies that compressed volatility and increased market correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:40:00">[47:40:00]</a>. [[Trend following strategies | Trend following]], being a positive convexity strategy, benefits from low correlation and market movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a>. Markets less influenced by central banks continued to trend well during that decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:29:00">[48:29:00]</a>.

## Capacity and Fees
Most investment strategies have a capacity limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:21:00">[50:21:00]</a>. For strategies like [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] on alternative markets, capacity is limited by the size of positions that can be taken in various markets, which is a function of liquidity and how quickly positions can be exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:28:00">[50:28:00]</a>. However, [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] on the 30-50 most liquid futures markets is a "huge capacity" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:01:00">[51:01:00]</a>.

Fees are influenced by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:08:00">[51:08:00]</a>. If there's ample supply of a similar return stream, prices (fees) tend to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:10:00">[51:10:00]</a>. When a strategy offers limited supply or superior properties, it commands a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>. Some institutional money, which previously negotiated very low fees, is now being returned by managers because the fees are no longer attractive given increased demand and capacity considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49:00">[49:49:00]</a>.

## Allocation and Timing in a Portfolio Context
When considering allocating to [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] in a larger portfolio, allocators should model entire portfolios, focusing on tail scenarios as well as average years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:17:00">[53:17:00]</a>. The value of an active and complementary approach, particularly during difficult periods for static long-only portfolios, has been appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>.

A straightforward [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] system might historically have an expected Sharpe ratio of around 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>. By adding alternative markets, improving execution, and incorporating different alpha sources, it's possible to retain the same overall risk properties while enhancing expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>. The goal is for [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] to not detract from a portfolio's expected return while significantly improving its tail performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:50:00">[54:50:00]</a>.

[[Trend following strategies | Trend following]] should be viewed as a genuinely diversifying return stream to any static investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:33:00">[55:33:00]</a>. Therefore, rather than reallocating from equity or fixed income, it's suggested to keep existing portfolio weights and simply add a small percentage to [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] (e.g., 10%) to improve overall portfolio properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:41:00">[55:41:00]</a>. While historical optimization might suggest a high allocation to managed futures, this is often unrealistic for institutional investors who are mindful of their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>, making a 10-20% allocation more typical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:00:00">[57:00:00]</a>.

Timing [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] itself is difficult because it requires knowing when and how quickly to adapt allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:11:00">[57:11:00]</a>. While higher average forward-looking volatility and lower average market correlation might suggest better conditions for [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]], practical limitations for most investors make timing unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:35:00">[57:35:00]</a>. Investors should be tolerant of periods of poor performance, as the best performance often follows such periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:17:00">[58:17:00]</a>.

## Cash Management
Cash within funds that is not needed for margin purposes is managed by a central cash management team at Man Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:30:00">[59:30:00]</a>. The approach is not to take heroic risks but to secure the best possible risk-free yield, typically through a combination of T-bills and other very secure government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:42:00">[59:42:00]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions
One common misconception about [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is that holding large directional positions will inevitably lead to portfolio blow-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>. While holding static, large exposures could be disastrous, the key is the dynamic and evolving nature of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:30">[01:01:30]</a>. Short-term correlation with equity markets, for example, does not imply a permanent "equity beta" or dictate future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

## Conviction Building
For investors, the crucial task is to build conviction that a systematic strategy, or the team managing it, will perform well in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. This involves understanding the systematic nature of the strategy, its underlying rules, and the robustness of the process used to evolve, modify, and improve it, ensuring the integrity of the system is protected while enhancing results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

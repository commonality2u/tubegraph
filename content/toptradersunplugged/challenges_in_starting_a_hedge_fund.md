Starting a hedge fund, particularly in the early days of systematic trading, presented significant [[hedge_fund_management_challenges | challenges]] for the founders of AHL. These included financial constraints, industry skepticism, and the complexities of building a team and operational infrastructure.

## Initial Financial and Operational Constraints
AHL began with very humble and "unpromising beginnings" in February 1987, stemming from a family brokerage business in London [00:03:30, 00:03:55, 00:20:49]. One of the co-founders, Michael Adam, described himself as "essentially unemployable" after dropping out of Oxford without a degree [00:03:36].

The initial trading portfolio was very small, starting with only 25,000 pounds across six physical commodity markets, including cocoa, coffee, sugar, and three base metals [00:06:30, 00:06:59, 00:07:08]. This limited capital meant there was a restriction on how many markets could be traded [00:21:02].

To survive and grow, the firm "hustled" by engaging in consulting work [00:21:16, 00:21:21]. This consulting, such as research for a company in option replication, proved to be valuable by teaching them new insights and allowing them to recycle work for other applications, like gearing a guaranteed fund [00:21:25, 00:21:32, 00:38:46, 00:39:00]. This period of consulting was driven by the need to "keep our heads above water" [00:38:53].

## Industry Perception and Skepticism
In the early days, combining science with finance was not a "usual cocktail" [00:10:08]. The systematic trading approach was often met with "ridicule" and considered "eccentric and Kooks" [00:35:42, 00:35:49]. The industry was seen as a "tiny industry" with a "little knot of people" [00:34:38, 00:35:23].

An article in The Economist during AHL's first year of existence predicted their failure, stating that "markets were efficient," and what they were doing "couldn't possibly work" [00:35:51, 00:36:19, 00:36:20, 00:36:22]. Systematic trading was seen as "heresy" [00:36:37] and on the "lunatic fringe" [00:36:44]. The co-founders themselves admitted to a period of "miserable" performance that almost led them to "throw in the towel on the investment management business" [00:22:37, 00:22:40].

## Building a Team and Recruiting Talent
Recruiting was a significant [[building_a_successful_hedge_fund_management_team | challenge]] for AHL. They couldn't afford experienced individuals and believed older candidates wouldn't want to work for them [00:29:00, 00:29:05]. This forced them to recruit "raw talent" â€“ new graduates and "young uninformed people" [00:29:11, 00:29:15, 00:29:41].

Surprisingly, this turned into an advantage, as experienced professionals often had "destructive and inappropriate" pre-conceived notions that were difficult to unlearn [00:29:24, 00:29:32, 00:29:33]. The founders found themselves "inventing the ways in which we wanted them to work from scratch" [00:29:45, 00:29:47].

The general cultural norm at the time was to seek "fancy jobs in big institutions" rather than start a business, making their entrepreneurial path feel like "the wrong thing" [00:25:43, 00:26:08]. This lack of social support and guidance meant they were "making it up as we went along" [00:28:54].

## Market Access and Cost Management
A key challenge was gaining cost-effective market access [00:31:53, 00:31:56]. The founders realized the immense importance of market access costs, measuring the "full cost of market access from the point of sampling to the point of execution" [00:19:54, 00:19:57, 00:20:00]. This led them to push for faster and cheaper execution, which created significant tension with brokerage divisions, as it "worked completely counter to the natural instincts of the brokerage division" [00:32:06, 00:33:00, 00:33:46]. This focus on reducing execution costs made them "extremely unpopular with the British" [00:20:20, 00:20:23].

## Overarching Mindset and Urgency
The founders operated with a constant sense of urgency due to the belief that their "edge" was "going to be taken away from us any moment" [00:43:22, 00:43:25, 00:43:34]. This mindset meant they were "always in a tearing hurry" to keep moving fast [00:43:36, 00:43:38]. Despite their success, they felt that if they had known what starting the business truly "entailed," they might not have done it again, describing it as a "bruising experience" [00:27:13, 00:27:20, 00:27:29]. This impetuosity, recklessness, or naivety was necessary to "get you over the hump" of doing something that might not appear to be a rational decision [00:27:48, 00:27:51, 00:27:53, 00:28:01].

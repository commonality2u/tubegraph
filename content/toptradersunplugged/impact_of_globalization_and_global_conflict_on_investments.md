Historically, the traditional 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) has been a significant bet on global peace and [[impact_of_globalization_versus_localization | globalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While this approach has been successful in the past, it may not be suitable for future economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Shifting Global Dynamics

Many of the structural dynamics that drove disinflationary pressures for 40 years before COVID-19 are largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Key factors include:
*   **Reduced [[impact_of_globalization_versus_localization | Globalization]]**: The world has moved from a period of high global integration to a less integrated one, partly due to China's entry into the WTO, which greatly increased productive capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   **Decline in Global Peace**: The unusual period of global peace experienced over the previous 40 years, where the loss of life in global conflicts was at thousand-year lows, is unlikely to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Resolution of Deleveraging**: Household and business balance sheets, which were in poor shape 15 years ago, are now in good standing, resolving the deleveraging dynamic and debt overhang from the post-GFC period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

This confluence of factors—[[impact_of_globalization_versus_localization | deglobalization]], [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | increased conflict]], and the resolution of deleveraging—suggests higher inflation ahead compared to the pre-COVID era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## [[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | Geopolitical Impacts]] on Inflation and Markets

[[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | War is inflationary]], while peace is disinflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | Global conflicts]] contribute to inflation not only through material destruction but also by causing a pullback of [[impact_of_globalization_versus_localization | globalization]] and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

The Fed's primary tool to address persistent inflationary pressures is to constrain domestic nominal demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. The question remains whether the Fed will reduce demand to contain inflation or allow inflation to run hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. If the Fed accommodates higher inflationary pressures, it will lead to a very different long-term macroeconomic environment than seen in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

One expert suggests that the Fed's current confusion about the economy, rather than political motives, might be preventing cuts despite inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. However, the Fed's independence is not guaranteed and could be influenced by future administrations, potentially leading to persistently easy monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## Investment Strategies for a New Era

In an environment likely to feature weaker growth and higher inflation, the 60/40 portfolio is unlikely to be the best performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. Most investors are ill-prepared for an environment different from the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

To prepare for a future with higher for longer inflation, investors should seek diversification to protect against persistent inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. This includes:
*   **Gold and Commodities**: These assets are critically important diversifiers for periods of higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. Diversification within commodities (e.g., a CRB type index) is recommended over overweighting specific commodities like oil, as it's hard to predict which will perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
*   **Diversified Beta Portfolio**: A good starting point is a beta portfolio with equal risk weight between stocks, bonds, gold, and diversified commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. This differs from a 60/40 mix, which is 95% driven by the stock market due to relative volatilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.
*   **Inflation-Protected Assets**: The portfolio should be tilted towards inflation protection assets like TIPS, gold, and commodities, rather than bonds, which perform poorly during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.
*   **Diversified Alpha Strategies**: Allocating about 20% of the portfolio to diversified alpha strategies, such as trend following, can provide significant benefits and agility, especially when assets may not perform well relative to cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

## The Role of Demographics

Demographics also play a role in inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. As workers retire, they remove productive capacity from the economy while continuing to spend, which can create an inflationary pressure, particularly by keeping labor markets tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. The inflationary or deflationary outcome depends on the interplay between demographics and monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

## Humility in Geopolitical Projections

For investors, it's crucial to understand the limits of their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. Projecting [[current_global_political_landscape_and_its_impact_on_markets | geopolitical]] outcomes is a different skill set from understanding macroeconomic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. Instead of trying to predict specific [[potential_geopolitical_risks_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical risks and global conflicts]], investors should focus on building a diversified portfolio that is prepared for a wide variety of potential consequences given the inherent uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:18">[00:54:18]</a>. The goal is not to project what might happen but to recognize and have the humility to understand that the future is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>.

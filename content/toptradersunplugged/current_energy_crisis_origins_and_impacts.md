The world is currently experiencing an [[global_energy_crisis_and_supply_chain_issues | energy crisis]], marked by a lack of sufficient energy supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While some advocate for a shift away from oil and gas towards [[role_of_renewable_energy_in_the_energy_crisis | renewables]], experts warn that this approach will only exacerbate the problem, as the immediate need is for efficient energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This situation is not primarily a carbon or [[climate_change_and_its_economic_implications | global warming]] issue for the time being, but rather one of immediate energy availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Origins of the Energy Crisis

The current [[global_energy_crisis_and_supply_chain_issues | energy crisis]] is attributed to a confluence of factors, not solely the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Underinvestment in Traditional Energy

A significant root cause is the massive reduction in capital spending within the oil and gas industry over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. Approximately two trillion dollars have been diverted away from the upstream energy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Governments globally remain "antagonistic and negatively predisposed" towards energy sectors, discouraging new investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Until this capital is reinvested, the problem will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.

### Limitations of Shale Production

While shale production was a significant source of supply growth in the past, accounting for one and a half to two million barrels a day of growth over 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, it has not responded as expected to current price signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. Companies have largely drilled out the "best parts" of the shale plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, and a significant inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells (DUC wells) has been brought online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>. Shale fields, like all others, succumb to depletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:00">[49:09:00]</a>. Furthermore, Wall Street continues to reward a mentality of returning money to shareholders rather than significantly increasing capital expenditures for new drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>.

### OPEC+ Spare Capacity Concerns

The spare capacity of OPEC+ countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Iran, is widely debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>. A notable incident involved a "hot mic" conversation between Macron and Biden, suggesting Saudi Arabia was "tapped out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>. Later, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) stated that Saudi Arabia's capacity would only increase from 12 million to 13 million barrels a day before reaching its limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.

> "Every country in OPEC is producing below its quota... everyone wants to cheat, they want to produce above their quota while keeping the whole group in check... they're all producing below their quota so it begs the question why not lower the quota or or you know is it is it a geological issue?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>

This implies that many OPEC countries are already producing at or near their maximum capacity due to depletion, despite their quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>.

### Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Depletion

The U.S. and other OECD countries have been releasing oil from their Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPRs) at an unprecedented rate, with the U.S. releasing about a million barrels a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>. The U.S. SPR is estimated to be about two-thirds depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>. This depletion is concerning as the SPR was established after the 1970s oil crises to act as a strategic deterrent against oil supply cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>.

### Natural Gas Underinvestment and Demand Growth

The natural gas industry has also suffered from a lack of capital investment over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>. Despite natural gas being a cleaner alternative to coal (producing half the CO2 per unit of electricity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:27:00">[41:27:00]</a>, it has been "wrapped up in the ESG nonsense" that has starved oil investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>. Demand for natural gas has been growing in excess of oil demand due to its environmental benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:52:00">[41:52:00]</a>.

### Criticism of Renewable Energy Policies

Current policies favoring [[role_of_renewable_energy_in_the_energy_crisis | renewables]] like wind and solar are seen as contributing to the problem because of their low "energy return on energy invested" (EROEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:00:00">[56:00:00]</a>. While oil and gas have an EROEI of about 30 to 1, wind and solar are around 10 to 1 over a 20-year lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>. This means that a large amount of energy must be invested upfront to produce a smaller net energy gain in the short term, exacerbating current shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:30:00">[57:30:00]</a>. Such policies are leading to [[challenges_of_renewable_energy | grid instability]] and blackouts in regions like Germany and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:36:00">[53:36:00]</a>.

The International Energy Agency (IEA), ironically set up to ensure security of supply, has contributed to market disarray by constantly forecasting surpluses and advocating against new upstream investments in traditional energy, including a "Royal Decree Proclamation" recommending against any new upstream energy investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:00:00">[38:00:00]</a>.

## Impacts of the Energy Crisis

The impacts of the current [[global_energy_crisis_and_supply_chain_issues | energy crisis]] are widespread and vary regionally.

### Regional Disparities

The impact is felt differently across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>:
*   **Europe**: Experiencing a very real and "foreboding" threat of energy shortages as winter approaches, particularly in Germany and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. France, while seemingly relaxed in August, still has price caps that may delay the full impact of higher bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **United States**: While gas prices are high, many people still feel somewhat insulated compared to Europe, with the situation being "manageable" for families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### High Prices and Volatility

Energy prices, including oil and natural gas, have seen extreme volatility. Oil prices, which were negative just two and a half years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>, surged to historical highs in the past four to five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

> "From having gone to the lowest energy prices in human history to the highest inside of two years, I mean I'm going to say that that's still a fairly strong cycle that we're in." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>

This reflects a strong commodity cycle, though not necessarily a "super cycle" that lasts forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Speculative trading has contributed to recent pullbacks, but underlying supply and demand dynamics are expected to dominate in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Potential for Further Shortages and Demand Destruction

There is potential for a "real choke point" in the winter months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The market is very tight, with commercial inventories building at a much slower rate than usual, despite SPR releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>. This indicates an underlying deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:23:00">[35:23:00]</a>. Ultimately, supply and demand must balance, either through finding new volumes or through "massive demand destruction" where price becomes a rationing mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

### Shift from Abundant Energy

The world has arguably reached the end of an era of abundant energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:15:00">[52:15:00]</a>. The last 10-15 years saw dramatic declines in energy prices across all major forms (uranium, coal, oil, gas), a "benign period" that allowed for the proliferation of energy-intensive pursuits like electric vehicles, cryptocurrencies, and even space tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>. This "surplus" was squandered, as investments were made in activities that depend on cheap, abundant energy rather than securing future efficient supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:39:00">[55:39:00]</a>.

### Future Economic Challenges

The energy crisis is part of broader [[future_economic_challenges_and_crises | future economic challenges and crises]]. The inability to increase energy supply efficiently will have significant implications for global economic growth and the standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16:00">[53:16:00]</a>.

## Potential Solutions and Future Outlook

While the immediate outlook is challenging, solutions exist for the long term.

### Nuclear Power as a Solution

Nuclear power is highlighted as a major solution because it is "extremely energy efficient" and addresses carbon emission concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>. Although current third-generation light water reactors are costly and have long lead times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>, newer fourth-generation small modular reactors (SMRs) are being developed that promise to address issues of cost, perceived safety (being unable to melt down), and waste reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:37">[01:03:37]</a>. Companies like TerraPower, financed by Bill Gates, are working on these advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:54">[01:03:54]</a>.

### Re-evaluating Energy Policies

There is a call for a realistic approach to energy policy that acknowledges the need for efficient energy sources to maintain the standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>. Rather than focusing on carbon at the expense of energy availability, policies should support investment in all forms of energy, including [[natural_resources_and_energy_markets | natural gas]] and nuclear, that can provide reliable power without compromising development, particularly in the developing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:03:00">[59:03:00]</a>.

### Convergence of Natural Gas Prices

A significant arbitrage opportunity exists due to the massive disparity in natural gas prices, with U.S. prices being 90% lower than in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>. This is due to infrastructure bottlenecks preventing U.S. gas producers from accessing world prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:25:00">[44:25:00]</a>. Experts suggest that a convergence of these prices is likely, either through increased LNG export infrastructure, higher domestic demand, or a leveling off of U.S. gas supply growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:47:00">[45:47:00]</a>. This convergence could see U.S. gas prices rise significantly, potentially leading to substantial returns for U.S. gas producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:51:00">[50:51:00]</a>.

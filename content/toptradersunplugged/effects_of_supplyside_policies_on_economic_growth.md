Supply-side policies significantly impact economic growth and [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]], often through regulatory changes and their influence on production costs and market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. These policies, while difficult for economists to precisely measure, are profoundly important in economic decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.

## Regulatory Policy and Economic Impact

Regulatory policy, encompassing areas like permitting, climate, land use restrictions, and labor licensing, plays a crucial role in shaping the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. The regulatory burden can shift by several percentage points of GDP between different administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. This directly affects potential growth and can have disinflationary effects by allowing the supply side to dynamically adjust to changes in demand, fostering non-[[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflationary economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

### Examples of Regulatory Impact

*   **Automotive Industry:** Regulations, such as requirements for cars to have automatic idling disablement equipment to reduce carbon emissions, increase production costs for manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. These regulations impose a compliance burden and make American auto production more expensive, leading to higher prices, and act as an [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflationary]] force on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:51">[00:46:51]</a>.
*   **Semiconductor Industry:** The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established a separate regulatory apparatus specifically for semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. This adds an entirely new set of regulatory hurdles for building semiconductor plants in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. While the government provides billions of dollars to the semiconductor industry for national security reasons, these additional environmental regulations make production more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>. This combination of support and restriction leads to lower potential growth and higher [[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

These examples illustrate how government policies can simultaneously "slam on the gas" with financial incentives while "putting restrictions on where it can happen," ultimately hindering efficient supply-side responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>.

## Historical Context: 2019 vs. 2022-2023 Inflation

Differences in regulatory policy are seen as a significant factor explaining why the U.S. experienced a non-[[inflation_and_economic_policies | inflationary]] 3.5% unemployment rate in 2019, compared to an "extremely inflationary" 3.5% unemployment rate in 2022-2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:34">[00:45:34]</a>. This suggests that supply-side policies can drastically alter the economic impact of similar labor market conditions.

## Importance for Investors

While central banks and demand management are important considerations for investors, it is crucial to also understand how the supply side of the economy operates and what types of government policies affect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. These policies, including taxation and regulation, influence decisions on entering fields, where to live, compensation, education, business organization, and trade, all of which affect long-term economic growth and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. A comprehensive macro-analysis requires understanding both demand-side and supply-side factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Market volatility plays a significant role in investment returns and the perception of skill versus "alpha" in fund management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Investors often look at track records to gauge future performance, but understanding the underlying factors contributing to returns is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

## Perceptions of Skill and Alpha
The perceived value from a manager's track record may not always reflect genuine skill or alpha generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. There's a concern about increased correlation between alternative strategies (designed to protect investors during traditional market downturns) and traditional asset classes themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Alpha does not always equal skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>. Managers may generate numerical alpha by taking more tail risk than their peers, rather than through superior skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

## Factors Influencing CTA Returns and Market Volatility
The CTA industry offers a case study on how various factors influence returns, often without involving genuine skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Today, about 90% of CTA returns are easily replicable, often outperforming by 3% to 5% a year due to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This highlights the importance for investors to look beyond broad industry baskets and understand specific factor drifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

Several factors have influenced CTA performance and their relationship with [[Volatility in financial markets | market volatility]]:

### 1. Sector Optimization
CTAs have increasingly allocated to fixed income, which has performed well over the last 20 years and is the most liquid sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Increasing fixed income allocation can improve a basic model's [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Impact on Volatility:** Fixed income has historically been negatively correlated to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. During equity corrections, fixed income exposure has provided substantial returns for CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

### 2. Long vs. Short Trades
Over 90% of returns from basic CTA strategies come from long trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. Short trades have made almost no money over extended periods, with only small returns during specific downturns (e.g., 2001-2003, 2007-2009) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Trading only long positions could improve the [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] by 80% over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Impact on Volatility:** Larger CTAs face higher transaction costs, making shorts unprofitable, leading them to focus more on long positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This shift is often imposed by size and has coincidentally performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

### 3. Time Frame Adjustments
CTAs have increased the time frames used for their models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. What was once a 10-day to 40-day simple moving average strategy is now often 10-day to 500-day moving averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This means average trade durations have increased significantly, from 10-15 days to 100-150 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.
*   **Impact on Volatility:** A 10-day to 500-day strategy has shown consistent positive returns even when shorter-term models flatlined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. Optimizing with longer time frames can improve the [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] by 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

### 4. Volatility Expansion and Skew
CTAs traditionally profit during trends, but the primary value-added aspect of their returns comes from making money when [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility is expanding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. This is known as "positive skew," where surprises tend to lead to positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>.
*   **Shift to Negative Skew:** To achieve higher [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratios]], CTAs have started taking profits faster and buying corrections within trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. This practice improves the [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] but makes them less capable of benefiting during [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility expansions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Mean Reversion:** This shift also involves more mean-reverting strategies, such as selling rallies and buying dips within trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. A simple model of buying the S&P when it's down three days in a row has shown a [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] of about 1.2 over 15 years, unaffected by [[Volatility in financial markets | equity corrections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>. Such strategies can improve the typical trend-following model's [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] by 130% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>.

### 5. Fixed Long Equity Exposure
The residual returns of the largest CTAs (controlling 50% of industry assets) show a 70% rolling correlation to the S&P 500, indicating fixed long positions in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.
*   **Impact on Volatility:** Adding a long S&P position could improve a [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Shorting the VIX (short volatility) has a similar effect, improving the [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratio]] by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>.

### 6. Carry and Credit Strategies
CTAs are also incorporating carry models, which can improve [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratios]] by 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>, and credit-type strategies (e.g., exposure to credit swaps), potentially improving [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratios]] by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.

These seven factors, while improving individual [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | sharp ratios]], are not skill-based and are highly correlated with the largest CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Crucially, they reduce the ability of CTAs to hedge [[Volatility in financial markets | equity corrections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. Large CTAs that introduced these styles underperformed replicators by 80% in absolute return during the 2007-2009 equity correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>.

## Quest Partners' Approach to Volatility
Quest Partners' original program has a philosophy of being a trend follower while generating significant alpha from positively skewed sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. This means avoiding strategies that involve buying dips in equities, allocating more to fixed income, going long equities, shorting VIX, or engaging in carry/credit spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

*   **Focus on Positive Skew:** Nine out of ten alpha sources are typically negatively skewed (involve mean reversion or risk-on trades), which Quest disqualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. The firm seeks out positively skewed sources of alpha that are more stable during [[Market volatility and volatility strategies | market regime changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.
*   **Shorter Time Frames:** Quest utilizes shorter time frames (average of seven days per trade) because this is where alpha can be generated, and where the most positive skew exists, particularly for benefiting from tail events or large increases in volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Volatility as Primary Criteria:** For Quest, [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] is the most important criterion behind their trade setups, rather than just price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. They are looking for the correct [[Investment strategies for volatility | volatility setup]] to generate alpha quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **Volatility Measures:** [[Understanding volatility dynamics in investment strategies | Volatility expansion]] is measured differently today than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. For instance, [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] is measured distinctly when the market is making new lows or highs compared to when it's in the middle of a range, providing insights into market character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.
*   **Market Memory:** Markets exhibit memory, with periods of positive serial correlation (trends) and negative serial correlation (mean reversion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Quest's philosophy is that investors misprice tail risk by using [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] as the sole measure of risk, leading to overallocation in markets with extreme tail risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Time Stops:** Quest applies time stops to their trend-following models to maximize alpha per unit of beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>. The optimal time stop depends on the setup condition; for example, a setup with immediate alpha generation might exit in 3 days, while an aggressive correction might allow a trade to run for two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:40">[01:04:40]</a>.
*   **Model Application:** Quest applies its five core concepts across all markets in its portfolio, emphasizing that not doing so would be an over-optimization within the current market regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[01:06:15]</a>. These concepts, such as market skew, [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility compression]], or [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] at extremes vs. the middle of the day, are robust across markets and time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.

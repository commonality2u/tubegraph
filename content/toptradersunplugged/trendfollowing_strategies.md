[[Trend following strategies | Trend following strategies]] are a significant investment approach discussed by industry leaders and pioneers in managed futures, particularly in relation to the "Turtle Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This strategy changed how the world learned about this investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Origin and Philosophy

Richard Dennis, creator of the Turtle Program, adopted [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] as his trading style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. His first introduction to [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] came from books by early pioneers, prompting him to conduct research by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. He later came to know other pioneers in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Jerry Parker, one of the original Turtles, was introduced to a "[[trend_following_strategies | trend follower]] type" like Marty Zweig through newsletters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. He saw the appeal of futures due to leverage, diversification across currencies, commodities, and interest rates, and the ability to go short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Parker realized that the strategy relied on large profits paying for small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The idea for the Turtle Program stemmed from Richard Dennis's realization that much of his own trading, and that of other traders, followed informal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. He initially believed that about two-thirds of trading involved following rules, with one-third being intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. To test whether people could be trained to trade successfully using rules, he started making notes that led to the program's creation within a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Dennis later came to believe that "mediocre rules are better than good traders' judgment" because persistence, which is crucial in trading, is nearly impossible to maintain using judgment alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Following a system ensures 100% persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

## Evolution and Modern Application

While the core philosophy of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] remains, its application has evolved. Brian Platt, another Turtle, notes that the basic philosophy of constant research to find robust systems hasn't changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. These systems require minimal parameters for initiating, liquidating, or avoiding trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Modern [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] aims to build systems based on momentum or range-dependent discrete time frames to confirm and capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Managing risk is paramount, done through trade size, market/sector limits, and portfolio-overlaying risk management concepts like marginal utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. This includes harvesting profits along the way, a departure from the original Turtle program's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>.

### Diversification in Trend Following

Diversification among markets is often cited as a secret to success in [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Jerry Parker believes in trading as many markets as possible, provided they are liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. He emphasizes setting up a portfolio's risk budget across different sectors and markets, noting that while highly correlated markets can be traded, attention should be paid to sector allocation (e.g., bond sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Parker advocates for including equities (long and short) in a diversified portfolio, as they can be the primary source of returns, even when other markets are dormant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. He views stock markets as just another trend to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

Richard Dennis states that liquidity predominantly determines market choice in [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. A typical portfolio might include 15-20 commodities and 15-20 financials, reflecting where the liquidity lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. An unbalanced portfolio in terms of financial vs. commodity futures, if driven by liquidity, would not be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. He finds that correlations between different markets (e.g., wheat and corn) are often not as high as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

## Challenges in Adoption

Despite evidence supporting the benefits of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]], such as access to uncorrelated markets, the ability to go long and short, taking small losses, and letting winners run, only a minority of investors have embraced it as a core portfolio component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

Several reasons are cited for this:
*   **Volatility and Drawdowns:** The return stream of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] is often difficult for institutional investors to accept due to internal rules regarding volatility and drawdown limits, which [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] CTAs frequently exceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Perception:** Investors often consider [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] strategies to be a "black box," meaning they don't understand how they operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Proponents argue they can demonstrate how their trading style performs in different environments, using statistics and probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
*   **Competition from Hedge Funds:** Historically, hedge funds had better performance and hogged allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.
*   **Strong Stock Market Performance:** A booming stock market, like the one that tripled in eight years, diverts attention and allocations away from other strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Fees and Expenses:** Historical fees and expenses of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] have been a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>.
*   **Focus on Firm Size/PhDs:** Investors sometimes prioritize the size of the firm or the number of PhDs on staff over market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Despite these challenges, there has been a recent shift, with some reports indicating that in the past year, inflows into hedge funds were only seen in [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>.

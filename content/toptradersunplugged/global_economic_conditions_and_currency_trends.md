## Current Economic Outlook: Shift Towards Recession

Peter Bersin of BCA Research, Chief Global Strategist and Research Director, has shifted to a bearish outlook for the US economy, expecting a recession to begin at the end of 2024 or early 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This contrasts with a bullish stance in 2022 and an expectation of "immaculate disinflation" in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While current Q3 GDP tracking estimates remain "pretty good" at around 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, recessions can start quickly and unexpectedly, as seen in late 2007 when GDP growth was also over 2% right before the recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The shift in outlook is largely due to the disappearance of previously insulating factors for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:
*   **Job Openings:** Record-high job openings, which previously allowed quick re-employment, have normalized to pre-pandemic low levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This means job losses will likely lead to rising unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Pandemic Savings:** Over two trillion in excess pandemic savings have been depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Mortgage Rates:** More people are now exposed to rising [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rates]] as they no longer have locked-in pandemic-era mortgage rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Key Economic Indicators Pointing to Weakness

Several leading indicators suggest economic weakness:
*   **Labor Market:** While current payroll numbers might not seem disastrous, leading indicators point to softening. The unemployment rate is an incredibly mean-reverting series, and its current low level suggests it's likely to continue rising, a trend it has historically never moved sideways from once it starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Half of the recent unemployment increase has stemmed from people losing jobs and struggling to find new work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. If this weakening continues, it will create a self-feeding spiral of higher unemployment and reduced spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Wage growth is slowing, and employment gains are declining as labor force participation has returned to pre-pandemic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Housing Market:** Home builder confidence has plunged, and building permits and housing starts have dropped significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is a key [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | interest rate]] sensitive sector and a leading indicator of economic weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. While there isn't a glut of single-family homes like in 2008, prices are very high, hindering affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.
*   **Consumer Spending:** Cracks are appearing on the consumer front, particularly among lower-income consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Credit card delinquency rates are back to 2011 levels when the unemployment rate was 8% (compared to ~4% now) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The savings rate is unsustainably low at around 3.5%, half of what it was in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. If people attempt to save more, it will reduce aggregate demand, leading to less employment and lower income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. While wealthier consumers drive much of the economy and benefit from stock market wealth effects, the ability to monetize home wealth through home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) is much weaker than it once was, with banks tightening lending standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Corporate Spending:** Capital expenditure (capex) intention surveys look weak, with firms outside the AI sector not spending significantly on new equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing:** The manufacturing sector appears to be weakening, with drops in ISM and manufacturing PMIs in most major economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Commercial Real Estate (CRE):** Delinquency rates in CRE are rising materially, and office vacancy rates are at a record high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This distress is problematic for regional banks highly exposed to CRE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, and stresses are also appearing in multi-family construction, shopping centers, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy Implications

### Fiscal Outlook
The current budget deficit is "very very large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, making it difficult to implement significant counter-cyclical [[fiscal_policy_and_government_debt | fiscal policy]] next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The tailwind from the CHIPS Act and IRA is expected to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. State and local government budget proposals call for substantial spending decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Political gridlock in Washington is also expected to prevent major stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. The current budget outlook is considered unsustainable, requiring either tax hikes or spending cuts in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

### Monetary Policy and Interest Rates
The Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates slowly, then aggressively once a recession begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. The target for the Fed funds rate next year is 2%, well below market expectations, and the 10-year treasury yield is projected to reach 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.# Global Economic Conditions and Currency Trends

## Current Economic Outlook: Shift Towards Recession

Peter Bersin of BCA Research, Chief Global Strategist and Research Director, has shifted to a bearish outlook for the US economy, expecting a recession to begin at the end of 2024 or early 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

*   **Mortgage Rates:** More people are now faced with higher rate mortgages, being less insulated from rising [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rates]] compared to those who locked in low rates during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

This distress is problematic for regional banks highly exposed to CRE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, and stresses are also appearing in multi-family construction, shopping centers, and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

### Inflation and Imbalances
Underlying [[inflation_and_currency_devaluation_trends | inflation]], excluding lagging components like shelter, is already down to 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a>. Wage growth, a key driver of services inflation, is pointing downwards as the labor market softens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. Despite some views, there are clear imbalances in the US economy:
*   Housing prices are 20% higher than in 2019 despite higher mortgage rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   There are significant imbalances in CRE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.
*   The unsustainably low consumer savings rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   A very large budget deficit and unfavorable debt dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

## Fiscal and Monetary Policy Implications

### Fiscal Outlook
The current budget deficit is "very very large" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, making it difficult to implement significant counter-cyclical [[fiscal_policy_and_government_debt | fiscal policy]] next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. The tailwind from the CHIPS Act and IRA is expected to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. State and local government budget proposals call for substantial spending decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. Political gridlock in Washington is also expected to prevent major stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:33">[00:49:33]</a>. The current budget outlook is considered unsustainable, requiring either tax hikes or spending cuts in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

### Monetary Policy and Interest Rates
The Federal Reserve is expected to begin cutting rates slowly, then aggressively once a recession begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. The target for the Fed funds rate next year is 2%, well below market expectations, and the 10-year treasury yield is projected to reach 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. This implies being underweight stocks and overweight longer-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:21">[00:41:21]</a>.
The next recession is not expected to be of the same magnitude as the 2008-2009 balance sheet recession, so rates may not need to go to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Historically, the first Fed rate cut has often signaled a coming recession because the Fed is typically behind the curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>.
Paradoxically, even if the Fed cuts rates, the effective borrowing rate for households and businesses could rise due to the current high interest rate at which new debt is incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

## Global Macroeconomic Trends and Currency Dynamics

### US Dollar Outlook
Normally, in recessions, the [[us_dollar_and_global_currency_movements | US Dollar]] strengthens as a counter-cyclical, safe-haven currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:18">[00:51:18]</a>. However, the dollar is currently expensive relative to purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>. Additionally, the Fed has more scope to cut rates than other central banks, which could move [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rate]] differentials against the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>. Thus, some dollar strength is expected during a recession, but not significant, followed by a period of dollar weakness once the recession ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

### Yen and Other Currencies
The Yen remains a very cheap currency, close to 40% undervalued relative to PPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. As the US and other major economies fall into recession, the Fed, ECB, and Bank of Canada are expected to cut rates aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>. The Bank of Japan, having barely raised rates, will likely not have significant capacity to cut further, leading [[global_monetary_policy_and_currency_stability | interest rate]] differentials to move in favor of the Yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The target for the Yen next year is 115 against the dollar, suggesting significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>. Investors should consider more defensive currencies like the Yen and Swiss Franc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

### Globalization and Commodities
The trend of increasing globalization has run its course due to competing spheres of influence, particularly with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>. This development is generally bearish for equities, as globalization previously provided a significant tailwind to stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:32">[00:56:32]</a>.

For commodity markets, a demand-driven downturn is generally unfavorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>:
*   **Metals vs. Oil:** The structural outlook for metals is better than for oil due to the green transition, which requires more copper infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Outlook:** Over a 12-18 month horizon, a bearish view is held for both copper and oil due to cyclical factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>. Copper demand is highly cyclical, and the weakening Chinese housing market and saturation of the EV market will reduce demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>.
*   **[[gold_and_currency_dynamics | Gold]]:** Gold is expected to hold its own as a defensive rather than cyclical asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Economic Impact
While AI's long-term economic impact is uncertain, current valuations in the stock market appear to be betting on the most favorable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. The ability of firms to capitalize on AI and achieve monopoly profits is questionable given the convergence of models and the lack of a clear "competitive moat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Unlike the internet, which offered obvious low-cost, superior models from the outset, AI is an expensive technology without a clear "big breakthrough" solution yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>. If productivity gains and profits from AI take as long to materialize as with the internet (e.g., 10 years for profits after initial productivity gains), investors could be disappointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. This could lead to a scenario where demand for AI chips comes down as profitability remains unclear, similar to the dot-com era's "picks and shovels" companies like Cisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
The quality of AI model output is also deteriorating as more training data (e.g., from Twitter or Reddit) is added, which may not be high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This adds to the uncertainty surrounding its long-term [[opportunities_and_risks_in_global_macroeconomic_environments | opportunities and risks]] and overall [[global_macroeconomic_trends | global macroeconomic trends]].

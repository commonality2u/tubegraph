This article explores the [[Systematic investment strategies | investment strategies]] and market analysis approach of Systematic Alpha Management, as discussed by its co-founder and CEO, Peter Campolin.

## Systematic Alpha Management's Trading Approach

Systematic Alpha Management trades approximately 20 to 25 different markets, which include major Global Equity indices, major currencies, and three commodities used for hedging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. They trade about 20 to 30 different spread combinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Each spread is traded using up to 20 different "sub models" or ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, leading to a total of about 200 individual signals monitored and traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

### Diversification and Holding Times
The firm applies different logic and rules when playing spreads, as the amplitude and duration of price fluctuations vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Models have varying average holding times, such as three hours, ten hours, or somewhat longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This approach aims to exploit both short-term and longer-term mean-reverting moves within a one to two-day timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Diversifying holding times results in uncorrelated returns, meaning, for example, an S&P 500/British Pound spread held for three hours can have almost zero correlation to the same spread traded with a different holding time model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

### Intraday Seasonality of Volatility
Another diversification method involves analyzing the intraday seasonality of spread volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. There are three points during the day when volatility is elevated:
*   **Early European morning hours**: Volatility is high due to potential mispricing of the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Late US trading hours**: Volatility is high because European markets might be mispriced, as it's after hours for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   **Around 9:30-10:00 a.m. New York time**: Volatility peaks as most price action occurs and news is released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

For strategies holding positions for hours, accounting for intraday seasonality is crucial, unlike long-term CTAs who hold positions for weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.

## Trade Execution and Position Sizing

### Exit Triggers
Systematic Alpha Management does not use a time stop for exiting trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. Instead, exits are triggered by a moving average of the spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Models with shorter average holding times (e.g., three hours) use very short look-back windows for estimating the mean or moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. This means if the spread moves up and then experiences a small reversal, it will quickly touch the trigger point for exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Risk Allocation
Position sizing is determined from a top-down approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
1.  **Overall Assets Under Management (AUM)** and **maximum exposure target** are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
2.  **Risk is broken down by three geographical regions**: Asia, Europe against US, and US against US/Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This allocation is based on historical returns, expected returns, and quality of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Historically, 55-70% has been allocated to European spreads, 0-10% to Asia, with the balance to North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. This review occurs roughly every three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
3.  **Individual risk levels are assigned to each country** within a region (e.g., UK, Switzerland, France, Germany, Euro Stoxx in Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This is based on historical P&L, backtests, and other tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Risk within each country is allocated to individual signals/spreads** using a proprietary optimizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This optimizer looks at one-minute real returns over the last 4-5 years and assigns more risk to models that not only produce the best returns but are also uncorrelated to other models in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
    *   The firm has a preference for US/UK spreads due to their stability and high correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.

On average, out of 200 signals, the firm makes about 20 trades a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Most models remain in cash when markets are fairly priced and no trading opportunities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. They act as arbiters, only trading when mispricing is detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

## Risk Management

### Hedge Component in Spreads
When looking at the Profit & Loss (P&L), the firm focuses on the full spread's performance rather than dissecting returns from individual legs (equity, currency, commodity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. Losing on a currency leg might generate extra returns via the index legs, demonstrating the integrated nature of the spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

### Open Risk and Stop Losses
For a single leverage share class with roughly 7% annualized standard deviation, the average notional exposure is 60% long and 60% short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. This translates to an average margin-to-equity ratio of about 12%, accounting for full margin on long, short, and hedging components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

Stop-loss levels are set at approximately 2% from the entry price for a particular spread (not the entire portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. The worst daily P&L experienced was minus 2.2% in 2008, a period when the S&P moved by 40 points in a minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>.

### Managing Drawdowns
[[Investing strategies and risk management | CTAs]] often spend most of their time in a drawdown, reaching new equity highs only about 20% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

A significant modification in 2011 was the introduction of a deleveraging mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>:
*   If a 5% intra-month drawdown (peak to trough) is reached, risk is initially reduced by 25% in the markets or spreads causing the drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
*   If a 7.5% portfolio-level drawdown is reached, deleveraging increases to 50% across all spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

This strategy aims to control the depth of drawdowns, as trading with less risk makes it harder to lose more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>. The firm does not wait months to re-establish risk; if recovery signs appear, risk is slowly added back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. This deleveraging approach is particularly helpful during crisis times, such as "Black Swan events" that are difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

In 2011, their drawdown reached 19% at its worst, though they ended the year at -11% due to a strong Q4 recovery, which contrasted with many other CTAs entering drawdowns at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>. Rel-leveraging (restoring risk) is more art than science; it involves assessing which countries or spreads are returning to normal and generating positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.

## Company Philosophy and Challenges

### Overcoming Drawdowns and Client Relationships
The firm fully recovered from its 2011 drawdown by July 2013 and reached a new high-water mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. Prior to 2011, having performed well during the 2008 market environment (where VIX reached 90), the firm had a sense of invincibility, thinking no other market conditions could derail them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. However, the European Debt Crisis in 2011 introduced an unforeseen risk factor: credit defaults, which the firm's models were not designed to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>.

It took time for the firm to realize the prolonged nature of the 2011 drawdown and implement modifications, with key changes introduced in early September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. Despite the challenges, the 2011 experience made the firm stronger, even though they had fewer assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:00">[24:49:00]</a>.

Peter Campolin advises caution with new managers boasting short, outstanding track records, as every manager with a 10-year track record has faced difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:04:00">[25:04:00]</a>. He believes the best time to invest with a manager who has a long track record and a proven ability to recover is during a drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:12:00">[26:12:00]</a>.

During drawdowns, despite doubts, the firm strongly believes their strategy will perform again because they have inside knowledge and a better understanding of their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:54:00">[28:54:00]</a>.

### Research and Model Robustness
The firm estimates parameters using walk-forward, out-of-sample tests and scenarios to ensure their parameters are robust and not over-optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>. They monitor how mean-reverting tests change over time for each country (e.g., over 10 years, 3 years, 6 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:00">[32:12:00]</a>. The key is to see no deterioration in mean reversion tests, which is central to their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. This informs their quarterly risk rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>.

Hedge ratios are recalculated daily to ensure trading reflects the most recent market relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>. If hedge ratios change rapidly, indicating a breakdown in correlation, they may move away from that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>. For example, they stopped trading the Nikkei/Japanese Yen/S&P relationship after two years when its correlation to the rest of the world disappeared due to new Japanese economic policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. Data is paramount; if data indicates a change, it's believed over fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:00">[36:11:00]</a>.

### Business Operations and Location
The firm does not perceive a significant "key man risk" for at least six months if one of the founders were absent, as everything is automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:08:00">[37:08:00]</a>. Located in the heart of New York City, they believe being in a financial hub helps with client meetings, access to talent, and the competitive energy of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:23:00">[38:23:00]</a>.

### Investor Behavior
The biggest challenge is convincing clients of the benefits of their portfolio, especially when they leave after a drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:00">[39:50:00]</a>. Investors appreciate uncorrelated returns when the firm makes money and others lose, but dislike it when others profit and the firm is flat or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>. Peter emphasizes the value of long-haul investors who understand and appreciate uncorrelated properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:50:00">[40:50:00]</a>.

Investors tend to be too focused on "headline risk" and prefer larger, "blue chip" firms, even if they lose money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:52:00">[47:52:00]</a>. Peter believes investors should prioritize the safety and liquidity of their investments (e.g., managed accounts, reputable third parties) rather than reputational risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:30:00">[48:30:00]</a>. The failure of "fund of funds" models is partly attributed to poor portfolio construction, often being too concentrated in similar names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:41:00">[49:41:00]</a>. Investors should focus on how a specific strategy performs and contributes to their overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:29:00">[50:29:00]</a>.

## Industry Observations

### CTA Trends and Cash Returns
Peter questions trend-following CTAs on why they expect trends to develop and strategies to work again after five years of poor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:00">[44:53:00]</a>. He also asks what percentage of CTA gains before 2008 came from cash returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>. Given that CTAs typically use only about 15% of their cash for trading, with 85% in cash or yield-producing instruments, significant returns prior to 2008 came from T-bills paying 3-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:34:00">[45:34:00]</a>. He estimates that cash returns could have contributed over 50% of CTA gains before 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:34:00">[46:34:00]</a>. The current low-interest yield environment means this extra cash return might not be generated in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:41:00">[46:41:00]</a>.

### European vs. US Managers
European managers have been able to grow larger firms in the last 10 years compared to many US managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:52:00">[42:52:00]</a>. Peter observes that European investors are more open-minded and willing to consider different [[Investment Strategy Divergence | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>.

## Personal Insights

### Qualities of a Great Trader/CTA
To become a great trader or CTA, one needs to have an edge, occupying a specific niche that is sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:42:00">[51:42:00]</a>. Success comes from having a unique idea, believing in one's ability to execute it better than others, and working extremely hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:07:00">[52:07:00]</a>.

### Personal Habits and Contribution
Peter Campolin's strength lies in "common sense," understanding what makes sense and challenging certain approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:20:00">[53:20:00]</a>. While his partner, Alexi, is the quantitative expert, Peter contributes to research by directing where to look for ideas and identifying areas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:35:00">[53:35:00]</a>.

### Biggest Failure
Peter identifies the firm's biggest failure as their inability to retain assets during the 2011 drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:44:00">[54:44:00]</a>. In retrospect, they should have intervened earlier, reduced risk sooner, and been more proactive in communicating with clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:54:00">[54:54:00]</a>. Despite the loss of assets, the changes and improvements implemented made the firm stronger and a "better manager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:37:00">[55:37:00]</a>.

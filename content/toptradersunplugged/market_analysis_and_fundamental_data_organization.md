Top Traders Unplugged, hosted by Niels Kaastrup-Larsen, features conversations with leading hedge fund managers, aiming to help listeners enhance their manager due diligence or [[Investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A key disclaimer is that past performance does not guarantee future results, and all [[Investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment strategies]] carry a significant risk of financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Introduction to IPM and Anas Lindell

The episode features Anas Lindell, co-founder and chairman of IPM, a firm managing over $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Lindell's [[Global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | global macro strategy]] is rooted in finding value by going against price drift and dislocation from fair or intrinsic [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | market value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Early Influences and the Adoption of a Rule-Based Approach

Anas Lindell's early career was shaped by significant [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | market events]], including the equity crash of 1987 and the 1992 attack on the Swedish Central Bank, where overnight rates reached 500% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. His background as an engineer, with a focus on control theory and mathematics, heavily influenced his [[Systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. His first job involved designing and implementing control systems for industrial processes, which are highly structured and require repeatable, controllable responses to various data inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

This engineering mindset contrasted sharply with the common practice of financial analysts and economists who frequently revise forecasts based on new data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Lindell observed that individual data points can be misleading, as economies generally move slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He learned the importance of focusing on longer-term trends and averages rather than short-term noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. His experience with [[Global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | global macro hedge funds]] in the early 1990s, who took patient, long-term positions based on solid [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | analysis]], further reinforced his belief in a [[Systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic]] and disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

> "I think both of the the the the that you mentioned you know the the the 90 the 92 500% rates here in Sweden the 94 uh fed hike but I think perhaps even more I I I I learned the sort of longterm outlook and and the value of patients and solid analysis by from many of the counterparts that we traded with and and and um you know basically the the the um [[Global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | Global macro hedge funds]] right that's sort of coming into the market with a view clearly stating that hey you know um currency at 523 24 25 to the to the Dodge Mark and and spreads of several hundred basis points you know this is going to play out in our Direction over time but you got to be patient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>

## Founding IPM: Addressing Tactical Asset Allocation

IPM was founded in early 1998 with the goal of helping institutional investors, particularly European pension funds and life insurance companies, with their tactical asset allocation decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Traditionally, these decisions were made by investment committees relying on in-house economists, external research, and various data sources, leading to a lot of "noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This often resulted in modest, rather than bold, portfolio changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Inspired by US firms providing structured [[Investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment services]], IPM aimed to offer a more informed and repeatable approach to tactical asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## IPM's Systematic Organizational Structure

IPM operates as a 100% [[Systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic]] firm, meaning all its processes are coded into software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. This allows for scalability and differs significantly from discretionary approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. The core of the firm is a research team of about 10 people, supported by four systems developers, who maintain and develop the trading models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. Three traders and a couple of risk management personnel supervise the daily trade generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. Other functions like middle office, legal, compliance, and business development support this central core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. This structure allows IPM to grow its assets under management (AUM) substantially without needing a proportional increase in personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

## Evolution of the Strategy and Long-Term View

IPM's [[Investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | strategy]] is designed to be relatively long-term, with holding periods that make short-term performance (e.g., three or six months) less meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. They recommend evaluating their track record over at least a three-year moving average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.

The strategy is less sensitive to changing market regimes because it focuses on trading markets "in a very relative sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>. For example, they trade US equities against German equities or Canadian government bonds against Japanese government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. They do not primarily care about absolute price levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>. This relative approach makes them more robust to significant [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | macroeconomic]] shifts like central bank interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

Regarding "model decay," IPM's strategy evolves through a continuous, long-term process rather than large, short-term changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. They typically introduce two to three changes annually, which can include new risk factors (sub-models), new risk analytics methods, or entirely new asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>. For instance, they recently started [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | trading]] Emerging Market currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. A significant evolution was relaxing the traditional tactical asset allocation restriction four years prior, allowing the model to be long or short both global stocks and bonds, rather than being forced to balance long positions with short ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. This change was driven by clients recognizing IPM as an "Alpha Source" rather than a classic Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA) strategy, and by the changing [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | asset class correlation structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>.

## The Systematic Global Macro Strategy: Themes and Dimensions

The objective of IPM's [[Systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic]] [[Global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | global macro strategy]] is to take risk in proportion to the opportunities identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>. The strategy is designed to perform well in environments where markets respond rationally to fundamental variables and mean-revert within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., one to one and a half years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>. It may struggle when markets ignore fundamentals and are solely driven by factors like central bank actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

IPM's approach to [[Global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | global macro trading]] involves:
*   **Identifying price discrepancies**: Based on sound fundamental [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | analysis]], they identify situations where prices are expected to mean-revert or where a risk premium is excessively compressed or an opportunity exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.
*   **Coded Risk Factors**: These opportunities are coded into software as "risk factors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:44">[00:59:44]</a>. The model is continuously in the market for all these opportunities, varying its position size based on the identified opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

The model is structured around two axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>:
1.  **Five Dimensions (Sub-Models)**: These represent the asset classes they trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>:
    *   Relative models on Emerging Market currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>
    *   Developed currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
    *   Equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
    *   Fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>
    *   Directional components (formerly "asset class" decision) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>

2.  **Four Common Themes/Phenomena**: These are applied across all five sub-models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>:
    *   **Value/Valuation drivers**: Identifying situations like purchasing power parity for currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.
    *   **Risk Premium**: [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | Trading]] different risk premiums, such as carry in currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
    *   **[[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | Macroeconomic factors]]**: Analyzing changes in money supply, government debt issuance, or trade balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
    *   **Market Dynamics**: Idiosyncratic factors specific to each asset class, such as the yield curve for bonds or cross-border investment flows for currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

All modeling is done in relation to global composites (e.g., comparing a specific government bond to a global basket of government bond futures) and is risk-adjusted, using "Zed scores" to measure deviations from long-term equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. They use as much historical information as possible to define "the norm," believing that longer data sets help avoid being caught off guard by shifts in market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. It is crucial for them to understand *why* a market might move back to fair value, rather than just observing a stretched relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

IPM currently trades about 40 markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>, focusing on exchange-traded instruments like government bond futures, equity index futures, and currency forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10">[01:10:10]</a>. They do not currently [[Overview_of_past_and_present_commodity_markets | trade commodities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

## Challenges of Market Integration and Volatility

As the world becomes more integrated, and central banks attempt to coordinate economies, finding [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | trading]] opportunities in relative [[Market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | market analysis]] within regions (e.g., Dutch vs. German equities) becomes less meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. This pushes IPM to explore new instruments and asset classes, such as Emerging Market currencies, to capture opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>. Despite the compression of volatility and smaller opportunities due to central bank actions, relative [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | market analysis]] remains relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.

One common strategy, carry [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | trading]], is described as "picking pennies in front of a steamroller" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>, implying significant risk if pursued too aggressively.

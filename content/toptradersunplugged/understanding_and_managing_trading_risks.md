Effectively managing trading risks is crucial for longevity and success in the business. It involves not only systematic approaches but also a strong psychological discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Key Principles of Risk Management

### Psychological Aspect of Risk
If trading problems keep you awake at night, it's a significant concern for long-term sustainability in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The goal is to address and deal with problems during work hours, preventing them from consuming personal time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The illusion of needing to spend 80 hours a week in the office, including evenings and weekends, is not sustainable for long-term careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### General Disclaimers and Considerations
*   Past investment performance does not guarantee or infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   All investment strategies carry a significant risk of financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Investors must request and understand specific risks from an investment manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Institutional Investor's Perspective on Risk
When allocating money to managers, an institutional investor considers several factors beyond just performance:
*   **Trust and Personality** The individual's trustworthiness is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Personal contact is important, and one must be able to trust the manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Due Diligence** Proper due diligence is essential, often involving a Due Diligence Questionnaire (DDQ), which is a comprehensive set of questions about the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This document should provide enough verifiable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Transparency** Managers who are too self-important to deal with you properly are a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Transparency regarding real vs. simulated results, structure, and legal jurisdiction (e.g., onshore vs. offshore) is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Track Record** While long track records (30+ years) can be good, older, larger organizations might become bureaucratic or run by non-owners, which can be a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. A five-year track record from a properly audited hedge fund with a custodian and administrator is considered decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Strategy Evaluation** Investors are not looking for the single "best" investment strategy, but rather a "building block" that fits into their existing portfolio and helps achieve a certain profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. They prioritize how a new product compares to and fits with their current holdings, rather than simply the highest Sharpe ratio or past gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Systematic Trading Strategy Design and Risk Management

For external clients, systematic strategies must be:
*   **Clear and Explainable** Avoid "black box" systems; clients want to understand the concept and rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Focused** Combining too many different models in one account may not make for a good product to sell, even if it makes mathematical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Allocation
*   **Volatility-based Sizing** Position sizing should ideally be based on some variation of volatility measurement (e.g., ATR), which acts as a proxy for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid Performance-based Sizing** Changing position sizes based on recent performance (like pyramiding) is illogical, as past performance doesn't impact future probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing** Due to non-static volatility and changing portfolio value, long-term positions need regular rebalancing to maintain the desired risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Level is Key** While entry/exit signals and position sizing are important at the individual position level, the overall result and risk-adjusted values matter most at the portfolio level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. An excessive focus on individual position performance is a common mistake in model development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

### Risk Management Across Different Asset Classes
*   **Equities (Stocks)** When trading equities, there's a primary dependency on the overall market index. Therefore, the risk profile looks different, and models will always be somewhat relative, meaning great gains during falling markets are not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Sector restraints might be needed to prevent over-concentration (e.g., 85% of stocks in Japan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **Futures** Futures models often involve deliberately taking "corner risks" â€“ high risk concentration in a particular area (e.g., shorting multiple crude oil complex instruments during a heavy drop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. This is considered a necessary evil of diversified trend-following that ultimately yields profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>.
*   **Exits** The importance of exits is debatable, especially at the position level. Simple exit rules, like exiting after 30 days regardless of market action, can still work well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.
*   **Trend Filters** Using trend filters or environmental measures can be helpful, especially for equities, to understand the prevailing market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.
*   **Diversification** For classical trend following, underlying diversification across many markets and instruments is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

### Specific Risk Measures
*   The choice of risk measures (e.g., standard deviation, Value at Risk) "depends" on the situation and organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.
*   Complex risk systems become more important for large organizations with many staff members; smaller teams can manage risk with simpler tools like Excel if managers are fully aware of all positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

### Stop Losses
Whether to use stop losses depends on the trading approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>:
*   For equity markets, traditional stop losses may not be used; other methods ensure positions are halted or closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.
*   For some futures models, stop losses are absolutely vital, especially in counter-trend models where a big move against the position can occur quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

### Drawdowns
*   **Investor Education** The most important aspect is ensuring investors understand the potential for drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. Communication is key to retaining investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
*   **Expect Worse than Simulated** Whatever drawdowns are simulated will likely be larger in reality and occur sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>. Always assume the worst possible scenario in simulations will be exceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **Plan for the Unexpected** It is crucial to have a plan for truly unexpected events that go "way off the charts," such as the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. The 2008 crisis highlighted risks like banks going bust and the need to manage cash across different institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. If these things weren't planned for before 2008, they must be now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>.
*   **Systematic Trading Strength** A key strength of systematic trading is having a plan for normal bad market conditions, knowing what to do win or lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. However, without special plans, even systematic traders can face significant challenges during unprecedented events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

## Questions for Investors to Ask
When assessing potential investments or strategies, investors should ask:
*   What is the objective (e.g., capital preservation vs. wealth building)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>
*   What risk tolerance is appropriate? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:41">[00:45:41]</a>
*   What kind of "building blocks" are needed, and how do different strategies fit together? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>
*   Be open-minded to new and unconventional strategies, as they can sometimes offer rising opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>.
*   **Detecting Strategy Failure** If a manager's strategy appears to stop working, ask for an explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>. Don't accept "black box" explanations; insist on real explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Detailed Questions** Investors should not be afraid to ask detailed questions, such as seeing position charts (entries and exits), attribution for combined strategies (e.g., by time horizons or market sectors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:34">[00:49:34]</a>. Many great managers are willing to provide these answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>.

## Further Insights
*   **Reading Recommendations:** For improving trading knowledge, Jack Schwager's *Market Wizards* books (especially the first two) are highly impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. Other recommended books include *Create and Manage Your Hedge Funds*, [[trend_following_with_managed_futures | Cathryn Kaminski's *Trend Following with Managed Futures*]], and Jerry Antonacci's *Dual Momentum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>.
*   **Programming vs. Trading Books:** Generally, more value can be found in reading programming books than trading books, as many people read too many trading books and too few programming books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

The Systematic Investor series introduces [[trend_following_in_investment_strategies | systematic investing]] as a dependable, consistent, yet often overlooked [[trend_following_investment_strategy | investment strategy]] [00:00:05]. The podcast takes the pulse of global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor [00:00:29].

### Trend Following in Market Overview

[[trend_following_strategies | Trend following strategies]] are highlighted as a means to protect portfolios, a topic previously discussed in relation to volatility [00:00:48]. Over recent months, [[trend_following_strategies | trend following themes]] have been observed as the primary driver of returns, particularly in long bonds and currencies against the US dollar [00:08:27].

October 2022 saw significant market events:
*   A Wall Street Journal article suggesting the Fed might slow down or pause rate hikes ignited a rally in bonds, currencies, and equities [00:08:50].
*   Bonds were up five points from their low but still down 23 points since July [00:09:10].
*   Currencies rallied against the dollar [00:09:16].
*   Equities were up about 10% from their October lows [00:09:19].
*   Equity markets exhibited monthly volatility comparable to, or even exceeding, [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following returns]] [00:09:26].
*   Dutch natural gas fell 66% from its peak in late August, indicating meaningful reversals [00:09:50].

CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors), often associated with [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]], showed positive performance in October [00:10:08]. [[trend_following_investment_strategies | Trend followers]] generally had positions in fixed income, possibly metals, equities, and currencies, and made money in energies, grains, and soft commodities [00:10:20].

#### Performance Metrics (October 2022, as of Wednesday close):
*   **Beta 50:** Flat for the month, up 19.6% year-to-date (YTD) [00:11:00].
*   **StockGen CT Index:** Down 0.26 basis points for the month, up 25.75% YTD [00:11:04].
*   **Trend Index:** Down 0.75 basis points for the month, up approximately 34.5% YTD [00:11:08].
*   **StockGen Short-Term Traders Index:** Down 0.32 basis points for the month, up 12.6% YTD [00:11:15].

In contrast, traditional asset classes experienced varied performance:
*   **MSCI World:** Up 6% for the month, down almost 22% YTD [00:11:23].
*   **S&P Total Return Index:** Up 6.8% for the month, down 19.6% YTD [00:11:31].
*   **World Government Bond Index:** Down 10 basis points for the month, marking the first negative return in a long time [00:11:38].

Overall, while October presented reversals, particularly in the UK (Sterling and Gilts crisis, leadership change, rebound in cable), [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend following]] performance remained relatively robust [00:12:13]. The "Cheap Trend" indicator (a simple 20-day/120-day moving average cross) was down over six percent in October, but still up 48-50% YTD [00:13:47].

### Portfolio Allocation to Trend Following

The question of optimal allocation to [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | Trend following]] in a portfolio is a recurring one, especially after periods of strong performance [00:16:09].

#### Historical Analysis and Benefits
Adding [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | Trend following]] or managed futures to a multi-asset or equity portfolio has historically shown benefits:
*   Increased return and reduced volatility [00:17:10].
*   Reduced maximum drawdown [00:17:18].
*   Improved skew and Sharpe ratio [00:17:21].

While a decade ago (2010s), adding [[trend_following_strategies | trend following]] might have reduced absolute returns due to strong equity performance, recent analysis (since 2000, or since 2020) shows it increases returns and improves all key metrics [00:17:39].

Optimizing a three-asset portfolio (equities, bonds, and [[trend_following_trading_strategies | Trend following]]) to maximize the Sharpe ratio suggests a nearly 48% allocation to [[trend_following_trading_strategies | Trend following]] when looking back to 2000 [00:19:06]. In 2019, a similar analysis for 2000-2019 suggested 37% [00:19:20]. However, for the 2010-2019 decade alone, it wouldn't have been allocated due to better risk-return from bonds and equities [00:19:34]. This highlights that optimal allocation is a backward-looking measure, sensitive to the chosen timeframe [00:20:01].

#### Expert Perspectives on Allocation
Consultants in the managed futures industry acknowledge that their models often recommend much higher [[trend_following_and_its_importance_in_investment_portfolios | trend following allocation]] than pension funds would consider, due to client reception [00:25:51]. Despite decades of white papers confirming its benefits, from John Lindner's work in 1983 to the present, allocation remains conservative [00:26:25].

Niels suggests a more pragmatic approach to determining allocation:
*   Analyze portfolio construction by picking extreme starting points, such as just before or after major crises like the tech bubble burst (2000/2002) or the Great Financial Crisis (2007/2009) [00:27:16].
*   This provides a robust analysis over at least 15 years [00:28:30].
*   Regardless of starting point, the allocation to [[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] remains the most consistent component, while equity and bond allocations shift significantly [00:29:05].
*   In current analysis (Q4 2022) using the GFC as a starting point, only equities and [[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] would be selected, excluding bonds entirely due to their lack of return since the crisis [00:29:41].

It is argued that [[trend_following_strategies | Trend following]] should be a core allocation in every portfolio [00:29:21]. A rule of thumb suggests a 20-25% allocation is "probably good enough," allowing flexibility with equities and bonds [00:30:39].

One of the benefits of allocating to [[trend_following_trading_strategies | Trend following]] is that a significant portion (80-90%) of the allocated capital is not needed for margin and can be held in safe, yielding instruments, allowing portfolios to benefit from rising interest rates automatically [00:32:51].

#### Macro Resilience and Future Outlook
A paper by GIC and MSCI, "Building Balanced Portfolios for the Long Run: A New Framework for Incorporating Macro Resilience in Asset Allocation," proposes a forward-looking, fundamentally driven asset allocation approach based on how assets respond to different macro environments and risks [00:22:04]. They highlight two major shifts: the rise of private assets and a changed macro environment with increased uncertainty [00:21:35]. The paper identified five key longer-term risks, including the shift from demand shocks (supporting negative bond-equity correlation) to more prevalent supply shocks [00:22:35]. However, notably, the paper did not include [[trend_following_trading_strategies | Trend following]] or managed futures in their recommended macro-resilient portfolios, which surprised industry experts, as these strategies are seen to boost portfolio robustness and adaptability to different shocks [00:24:08].

Despite complex models, the future is inherently unpredictable [00:37:03]. The concept of "regime change" or long-term cycles, such as the 40-year interest rate cycle (peaking in 1981 and hitting a low in 2021), suggests an era of increased market volatility [00:43:08]. This environment, characterized by "great volatility" as warned by central bankers, is seen as particularly favorable for rules-based strategies like [[trend_following_investment strategies | Trend following]], which can adapt to unpredictable market movements [00:43:17]. These strategies are seen to have an advantage over fundamentally-driven investments in such conditions [00:47:21].

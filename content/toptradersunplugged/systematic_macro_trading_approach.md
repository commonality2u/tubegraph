IPM, co-founded by Anas Lindell, employs a [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | systematic quantitative analysis in trading]] approach to global macro trading, aiming to identify price discrepancies based on sound analysis and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. This method is distinct from discretionary trading due to its reliance on coded software and predefined risk factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.

## Origins and Philosophy

Anas Lindell's background as an engineer, focusing on control theory and mathematics, heavily influenced his [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading systems]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. His early experience designing control systems for paper and pulp mills, which involved structured processes responding in a repeatable and controllable fashion, laid the groundwork for his financial methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Key market events, such as the 1987 equity crash and the 1992 attack on the Swedish Central Bank, where overnight rates reached 500%, reinforced his focus on finding value by going against price drift and dislocation from fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. These experiences, coupled with observations of [[global_macroeconomic_influences_on_trading_strategies | Global macroeconomic influences on trading strategies]] from global macro hedge funds that emphasized patience and solid analysis, led him to prioritize a long-term outlook and a rule-based or mechanical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

IPM's core philosophy centers on organizing fundamental data to be implemented in a non-emotional and disciplined way, avoiding the pitfalls of constantly revising forecasts based on new economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## IPM's Systematic Structure

IPM operates with a 100% [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] approach, meaning all processes within their two main programs (Systematic Macro and long-only Equity) are coded into software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. This structure allows for scalability and differentiates them from firms relying on discretionary decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>.

The organization's heart is a research team of about 10 people, supported by four systems developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. Their daily task is to maintain and further develop the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. Three traders and a couple of risk professionals are also part of the core team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. The firm's middle office handles traditional functions like risk checks, position verification, and reconciliation with counterparties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

IPM's organizational design is similar to that of a typical CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor), enabling efficient scaling without needing to significantly increase staff even with substantial AUM growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

## The Systematic Macro Program

The objective of the Systematic Macro program is to take risk in proportion to identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. It can be run at various expected volatility levels, with most institutional investors being comfortable up to 20-25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>. The typical target return is around 10% net per annum to the client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. IPM aims for a Sharpe ratio just south of one for this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

### Ideal Environment
The strategy is designed to perform best in market environments where prices respond rationally to fundamental variables, allowing for mean reversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. This means markets that eventually return to their underlying fundamental development, ideally within one to one and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Periods where markets are solely driven by non-fundamental factors, like central bank interventions, can be challenging as the model's performance becomes more random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

### Strategy Structure
The model is built on two axes:

1.  **Five Sub-models/Dimensions:**
    *   Relative models for Emerging Market currencies (started trading in 2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>
    *   Developed currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>
    *   Equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
    *   Fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
    *   A directional component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>

2.  **Four Common Themes/Factors (for each sub-model):**
    *   **Value:** Identifying valuation drivers, such as Purchasing Power Parity for currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.
    *   **Risk Premium:** Trading based on risk premia, e.g., long-term bonds or carry in currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
    *   **Macroeconomic Factors:** Analyzing changes in money supply, government debt issuance, and trade balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
    *   **Market Dynamics:** Idiosyncratic factors specific to each asset class, such as the yield curve for bonds or cross-border investment flows for currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

The model constantly assesses opportunities across these dimensions and themes, taking positions that are more or less directly proportional to the identified opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. It is always in the market for all instruments and themes, but to varying degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

### Modeling Approach
IPM models everything in relation to global composites, which helps to remove the need to model absolute developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. For example, instead of comparing the Dollar-Yen rate, they look at the Yen in isolation against a global basket of currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:26">[01:05:26]</a>. All analysis is risk-adjusted and normalized, resulting in "Z-scores" indicating standard deviations from long-term equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:06:02]</a>. To define "the norm," they use as much historical data as reliably available, recognizing that markets change and short periods may not be representative of future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

It is crucial for IPM to understand *why* a market might move back to fair value, not just that it is stretched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>. They actively try to model the forces that push prices away from or back to equilibrium, and that cause risk premia to be over or underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:16">[01:09:16]</a>.

IPM currently trades about 40 markets, primarily using exchange-traded government bond futures, equity index futures, and currency forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:59">[01:09:59]</a>. They do not trade commodities currently, but it is a possibility for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.

### Evolution of the Strategy
The [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | building and evaluating systematic trading strategies]] at IPM is a long-term evolutionary process, with typically two to three changes introduced annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. These changes can include:
*   Additions of new risk factors or sub-models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a>.
*   Introduction of new risk analytics methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   Entirely new models or asset classes, such as the recent inclusion of Emerging Market currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.

A significant philosophical change occurred four years prior to the interview, when IPM relaxed the traditional tactical asset allocation restriction that required being short an equivalent amount for every long position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. This means the program can now be long or short both global stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>. This change was prompted by the shift from a classic GTAA (Global Tactical Asset Allocation) setting to a [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic global macro]] approach, where risk neutrality in dollar terms was not meaningful and asset class correlation structures had changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>.

## Track Record Evaluation
When evaluating the performance of this [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | systematic investing and trend following]] program, it's important to consider its long-term nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. Holding periods are significant, making short-term performance metrics (e.g., three or six months) misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>. It's best to look at a three-year moving average of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. Due to its relative trading approach, the program is less sensitive to changing macro environments or regimes, as it trades markets against each other rather than focusing on absolute levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>. While dislocations may temporarily go against the strategy, they typically mean revert over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## Talent and Retention
For [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | building and evaluating systematic trading strategies]], IPM takes a targeted approach to hiring, first identifying specific talent gaps within their team and then actively seeking individuals to fill those roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. This is in contrast to simply sifting through general applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

To compensate and retain talent, IPM focuses on long-term business development contributions and idea sharing rather than individual returns, ensuring all staff are compensated based on overall company earnings (EBIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:38:25]</a>. This fosters a collaborative environment and mitigates competition for individual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>. Being based in Stockholm also helps in retention, as there are relatively few direct competitors targeting talent in that market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

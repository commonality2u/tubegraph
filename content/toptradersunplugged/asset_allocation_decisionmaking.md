Asset allocation is considered by Anas Lindell, co-founder and chairman of IPM, as the central and most important decision for long-term investors to gain relevant returns on their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Components of Asset Allocation

There are two main parts to the asset allocation decision:
1.  **Strategic Long-Term Asset Allocation** This involves setting targets for how funds will be invested in various asset classes, typically over a period of three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
2.  **Tactical Asset Allocation** This is a shorter-term decision that addresses tactical deviations from the long-term strategic targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These deviations can be intentional or result from market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The key is how to manage these situationsâ€”whether to continue deviating, reduce, or increase positioning relative to the benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This tactical decision is immensely important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Traditional vs. Systematic Approaches

Traditionally, many pension funds and life insurance companies in Europe made these decisions by relying on in-house economists, invited investment bank economists, independent economists, and extensive research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. An investment committee would compile and analyze this data monthly or quarterly to make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This process was susceptible to "noise" from the analytical and economist community changing views based on new data points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Decisions made by these committees were often modest in size, for example, changing a 60/40 bond/stock exposure to 58/42 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This process was often long and cumbersome, contributing little to the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

In contrast, some firms in the US had already started providing investment services to help long-term institutional investors make more informed asset allocation decisions, using solid information, methods, and a repeatable fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This systematic approach triggered the founding of IPM in early 1998, with the aim of helping European pensions and lifers with their tactical [[optimal_portfolio_allocation_strategies|asset allocation decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Evolution of Asset Allocation

The world has changed significantly over the past 10 to 30 years, impacting how institutions deal with [[asset_allocation_and_macroeconomic_risks|asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

*   **US vs. European Institutions**: US institutional investors have generally progressed further than their European counterparts in allocating a significant part of their risk budget to hedge funds and alternative sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While a European institution having a hedge fund allocation exceeding 3-5% would be unusual, it's the norm in the US, often reaching 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   **Funding Ratios**: This difference is partly due to the state of pension systems; US pensions (corporate and state) are often significantly underfunded (e.g., 60-70% funding ratio), while many funded European pension systems have higher ratios (e.g., 100% or better) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. Underfunded entities need to seek methods to make up for shortfalls quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Insourcing Challenges**: Efforts by pension funds, like ATP in Denmark, to insource alpha teams to manage strategies internally have faced challenges. These include political and regulatory issues, as well as the difficulty of fostering an entrepreneurial spirit within a traditional organizational structure, making it hard to retain talent due to competitive market compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.
*   **Relaxing Traditional Restrictions**: IPM, in its [[global_macroeconomic_strategies_and_asset_allocation|systematic Global macro strategy]], relaxed a traditional tactical [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation|asset allocation]] restriction about four years prior to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. Previously, for every dollar long in an asset, there had to be a similar amount short in another (e.g., overweighting one asset class meant underweighting another) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. While relative models still maintain this (e.g., trading equity markets against each other), the broader "global asset class decision" now allows for being long or short both global stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. This change was prompted by the shift from a classic Global Tactical Asset Allocation (GTAA) setting to a global macro systematic approach, where the dollar-based balancing was not risk-neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>. Additionally, changing asset class correlation structures over 15-20 years made the hardcoded restriction less relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Strategy

IPM's [[systematic_investing_strategies|systematic investment strategies]] are based on fundamental input and thorough economic analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. The objective of their systematic macro program is to take risk in relation to identified opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

*   **Risk and Return Targets**: The strategy can be run at various risk levels, typically aiming for 10% net per annum for institutional clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>. It's not designed for a high Sharpe ratio of 1.5 or 2, which is deemed unrealistic for this type of strategy given its continuous market presence across various instruments and themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>. A reasonable target for such a strategy is just under one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:50">[00:51:50]</a>.
*   **Environmental Sensitivity**: The model is designed to perform best in environments where markets respond rationally to fundamental variables over a reasonable time period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:34">[00:52:34]</a>. This means that if markets are driven solely by factors like central bank actions rather than fundamentals, performance may not be optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Mean Reversion**: A core belief of the model is in mean reversion, expecting that assets deviating from fair value or equilibrium will eventually return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:45">[01:00:45]</a>.
*   **Relative Trading**: The strategy trades markets in a relative sense (e.g., US equities against German equities, Canadian government bonds against Japanese government bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. This makes the strategy less sensitive to absolute market levels and changing regimes compared to models that focus on each instrument in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>. Relative inflation, for instance, is always expected to play a role in currency pair pricing, even if short-term deviations occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.
*   **Market Integration**: As global markets become more integrated (e.g., European equities), opportunities for relative value trades between closely linked economies diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>. This necessitates looking for opportunities elsewhere, such as in emerging market currencies or other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.
*   **Model Structure**: The model has five sub-models based on asset classes (Emerging Market currencies, developed currencies, equities, fixed income, and a directional component) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. These sub-models identify opportunities based on four common themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>:
    1.  **Value**: Identifying valuation drivers (e.g., purchasing power parity for currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.
    2.  **Risk Premium**: Trading risk premiums (e.g., carry in currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
    3.  **Macroeconomic Factors**: Responding to changes in money supply, government debt issuance, trade balances, etc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
    4.  **Market Dynamics**: Idiosyncratic factors specific to each asset class (e.g., yield curve in bond markets, cross-border investment flows for currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

## Data and Modeling

All modeling is done in relation to global composites to eliminate the need for modeling absolute developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. For example, Government Bond Futures prices and driving factors are compared to a global basket of such futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>. Currencies are analyzed in isolation against a global basket of currencies, forming synthetic instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.

Everything is modeled in relation to its own history and risk-adjusted, resulting in "Z-scores" or the number of standard deviations away from long-term equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a>. The model uses as much historical information as possible to define "the norm" to avoid being caught off guard by short-term regime shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>. While the model is systematic, there is a fundamental understanding of the forces that cause prices to move away from or back to fair value, or risk premia to become over/underpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>.

IPM currently trades about 40 financial markets, primarily exchange-traded Government Bond Futures, Equity Index Futures, and currency forwards, with no commodities currently traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

## Carry Trading

Carry trading is described as "picking pennies in front of a steamroller," where the "greedier you get, the closer to that steamroller you're going to be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>. This highlights the inherent risk in such strategies.

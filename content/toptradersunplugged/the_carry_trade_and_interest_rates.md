The "Systematic Investor Series" often explores systematic investing strategies, including the concept of the carry trade, especially in the context of [[carry_trades_and_their_characteristics | carry trades and their characteristics]] and [[impact_of interest_rates_on_markets | the impact of interest rates on markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A key discussion point in 2022 centered on whether the prevailing "carry regime" had ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Defining the Carry Regime

The "carry regime" can be defined as a period, roughly from 2000 to 2019, characterized by a stable environment where central banks maintained full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. During this era, investors performed well by simply being long stocks and bonds, especially leveraged bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

The defining characteristic of all carry trades is a supply and demand imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. In a market where the whole world is long, creating a massive left tail skew in volatility markets, people hedge that tail, which creates this imbalance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This has been exacerbated by massive positive flows into investment due to zero percent [[impact_of_shortterm_interest_rates_on_investments | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## The End of the Carry Regime?

The year 2022 did not unfold as many experts predicted, and it has been described as the end of an era where central banks were fully in control for the prior two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A listener's question, inspired by the book "The Rise of Carry," prompted a debate on whether the carry regime that dominated the past 12 to 14 years has ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Indicators of Change
*   **Regime Transition:** Mark suggests that the market may be in a period of regime transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Opportunities in carry trades arise when there is dispersion in returns and differences in central bank behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. High [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | volatility]] or spikes in [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | volatility]] typically require exiting carry trades, but these periods usually subside, allowing opportunities to reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Less Leverage:** Jim believes that the regime is slowing for the next decade, primarily as a function of less leverage in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This deleveraging removes some of the positive bias seen previously because the cost of money is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This should counterintuitively reduce the fat tail over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Flattening Skew:** A defining characteristic of 2022 has been a flattening skew, which Jim considers somewhat efficient in the medium to longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Divergent Views
Rob notes that his empirical evidence for a cross-asset carry strategy (in futures) shows poor performance in the last 18 months to two years, especially since COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, he emphasizes that this is not unprecedented, as carry performed badly in 2008-2009 and 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He also points out that carry did very badly in the late 1970s before going on a 25-30 year bull run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Rob doesn't see enough evidence to stop trading carry strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Jim agrees that carry is not "dead or going away," as it represents a structural supply-demand imbalance in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. However, he argues that the current deleveraging is slower and more extended than in 2008, akin to the inflationary 1970s when the cost of money rose secularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Such periods create headwinds for carry trades because supply and demand imbalances become more balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The consensus is that there is a [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | regime shift]] underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Long-standing trends of declining [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rates]], falling inflation rates, and globalization appear to be shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This new era, potentially characterized by "great volatility" (as per Isabel Schnabel), means macro trends have reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While the term "end of carry" might be an oversimplification, as carry opportunities will always exist (e.g., in Dollar-Yen or backwardated commodity markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, the easy money from simply going long natural assets for carry benefits is likely over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The real distinction is the end of the era of cheap leverage for buying and holding assets for long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Traders will now have to "work for their money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Impact of Rising Interest Rates on Markets

The year 2022 saw a significant shift in monetary policy, with [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets | central banks grinding their rates higher]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. From near zero [[impact_of_shortterm_interest_rates_on_investments | interest rates]] at the start of 2022, fed funds rates increased by approximately 500 basis points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>.

This environment has implications for carry strategies:
*   **Volatility Expansion:** In some markets, particularly [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | interest rates and bonds]], there were very favorable setups due to strong [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | volatility expansion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. When signals to go short emerged, positions could be put on in significant size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Higher Interest Rates:** The presence of higher [[impact_of_shortterm_interest_rates_on_investments | interest rates]] also provided a small additional positive for strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Secular vs. Cyclical:** The change in Federal Reserve activity and monetary policy dominance is creating a new secular trend, moving away from a 40-year period of cyclical moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | secular shift toward higher inflation]] and less Fed dominance historically "kills skew" and removes the upside trend in markets, leading to more two-sided markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **Risk Premium:** The shift also implies that risk premium itself should increase, which could benefit CTA strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>. The spread between implied and realized [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | volatility]] is expected to increase due to less liquidity, creating more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

Historically, periods like the 1960s and 1970s, characterized by higher inflation, saw equity markets go nowhere for extended periods in nominal terms, declining significantly in real terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. Such periods often featured more frequent recessions and mean reversion in markets, with less upside volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:39">[00:46:39]</a>. This scenario, with less competition for risk premium and less leverage, could create more opportunities for risk premium harvesting strategies over longer timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:15">[00:48:15]</a>.

## Lessons from 2022

The events of 2022 reinforced the importance of humility and open-mindedness in financial forecasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>. Events can unfold much faster than anticipated, such as the rapid rise in [[interest_rates_and_currency_trends | interest rates]] and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>. The market quickly adjusts to new regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>.

The year emphasized that while predicting market direction is difficult, understanding the "shape" of the distribution and the forces acting upon the market environment is more feasible and can be incredibly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>. This means focusing on understanding the regime, which provides an edge on the likelihood of future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. The unexpected movements, such as negative oil prices, serve as a reminder to be open to the "unimaginable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

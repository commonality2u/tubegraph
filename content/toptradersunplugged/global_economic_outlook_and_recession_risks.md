Top Traders Unplugged, hosted by Niels Kaastrup-Larsen and Jim Kaasan, featured a discussion on the global macroeconomic landscape with prominent experts Andreas Steno Larsen and Alfonso Picariello <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Their differing views on the big macro picture contributed to an engaging conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

## Guests' Backgrounds

### Alfonso Picariello
Alfonso Picariello, 31, from Southern Italy, started his financial exposure at 14 through his mother, a bank treasurer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. He worked for European bank ING for seven years, leading a team of portfolio managers and becoming head of a $20 billion multi-asset investment portfolio with a fixed income focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Six months prior to this discussion, he began his own venture, primarily through his newsletter, "The Macro Compass," and his Twitter account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Andreas Steno Larsen
Andreas Steno Larsen also started in finance at a very early stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. At 16 or 17, he won an equity game run by a Danish bank by leveraging risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. He is currently employed at a real estate private equity fund and was previously a sell-side analyst for 10 years, culminating in his role as Global Chief Strategist at Nordea, the largest Northern European bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. He was once censored by a Finnish politician for comments about vaccine companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

## Current Macroeconomic Frameworks

### Alfonso Picariello's Outlook
Alfonso's current macro outlook is based on a very directional bet on tighter financial conditions and slower economic growth, a toxic combination for risk assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. His top three trades reflect this: short S&P 500, short BTPs against long bonds, and short credit spreads in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. He uses a four-quadrant asset allocation tool called "The Macro Compass," which incorporates forward-looking indicators for economic growth, such as his Global Credit Impulse Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This index has been on a descending path for several months/quarters because governments have ceased fiscal stimulus and banks are lending less (excluding mortgages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. This means less spendable money for the private sector, leading to a lag in earnings, GDP growth, and consumer confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Meanwhile, central banks are aggressively tightening monetary and financial conditions, pushing risk-free real interest rates above equilibrium levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This makes portfolio allocations shift towards more defensive stances, as positive risk-free real returns become available in most jurisdictions, including the US and increasingly Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

### Andreas Steno Larsen's Outlook
Andreas believes Europe is already in a [[potential_us_recession_predictions | recession]], particularly core eurozone countries like Germany, and expects it to continue for the next few quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. He is puzzled by the consensus that central banks can continue tightening, asserting that inflation will naturally decline next year due to their recent rhetorical tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. His main position is that long bond yields have peaked due to a clear slowdown in the growth cycle and inflation cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

A key shift in his view over the past year is his initial support for direct fiscal transfers to households in the US by the Trump and Biden administrations, which he initially saw as a brilliant fiscal tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. He even suggested European politicians do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. However, he now admits this was a mistake, recognizing that during lockdowns, these transfers forced people to buy physical goods instead of services, creating inflationary pressure on already stressed supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

## The Inflation Debate

Jim Kaasan highlighted that for 40 years, the global economic system has been driven by central banks and monetary policy, leading to a technological revolution and a broadly deflationary environment. This has also accelerated globalization, as corporations sought to reduce costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>. The primary beneficiaries of this system have been corporations and wealthy individuals, leading to massive inequality, which central banks are not mandated to address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>. This inequality fueled populism, which was further exacerbated by COVID-19 and the shift to fiscal policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

### Monetary vs. Fiscal Policy
Andreas agrees that Quantitative Easing (QE) is largely deflationary, contrasting with central bank claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a>. He explains that QE creates bank reserves with no velocity, trapped within financial institutions and not circulating in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:43:00">[18:43:00]</a>. Alfonso clarifies that QE creates bank reserves stuck in the interbank system, while direct transfers from governments (fiscal deficits) create spendable money for the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. However, even increased bank deposits don't guarantee inflation, as seen in Japan where continuous government deficits for 25-30 years haven't led to inflation because the private sector used new money to repay existing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>.

### Structural vs. Cyclical Inflation
Andreas distinguishes between structural and cyclical inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. Cyclically, he expects slowing inflation due to:
*   Lack of credit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>
*   Slowing growth cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>
*   Easing supply chains due to fewer COVID-related restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>

Structurally, however, Andreas agrees that the next time the economy slows, direct transfers and universal basic income measures are likely to be used again, which are inherently inflationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

Alfonso emphasizes that policymakers are reactive, not proactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>. The US government printed too much money (fiscal stimulus) in 2020-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>. As of May 2022, they are draining resources to counter excessive aggregate demand and bring inflation under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:24:00">[24:24:00]</a>. He doesn't foresee Western governments structurally transferring more resources to the private sector year after year due to inflation concerns, especially in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>. Jim, however, believes that due to democratic pressures and populism, governments will continue to implement policies that, while sounding helpful, are inflationary (e.g., gas tax holidays, first-time homebuyer credits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Inflationary/Deflationary Forces

### Demographics
Andreas believes that demographic projections for Europe and China suggest extremely low potential growth, possibly even zero labor force growth in 5-10 years, similar to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>. This implies no reason to fear an inflationary breakout from demographics in Europe, although the US looks better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>. His assumption is that an older population, facing an increased dependency ratio, will save more to ensure future savings, which leads to lower interest rates, not higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>.

Alfonso acknowledges the shrinking labor force but argues that the economy is moving towards a technological regime, not an industrial one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>. US companies today need only 10% of the employees they did in the 1970s to generate the same sales, and this trend will continue due to robotization and technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:16:00">[36:16:00]</a>. Thus, while labor force shrinks, demand for labor will also decrease over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:15]</a>.

### ESG and Energy Policy
Andreas identifies energy policy as a "dark horse" for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>. He states that it is impossible to quickly replace natural resources from Russia, and if attempted, it would lead to massive cost-side pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>. Politically, people will eventually vote for alternatives if energy prices double or triple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:44:00">[34:44:00]</a>.

Alfonso argues that while ESG and net-zero transitions are inflationary, current assumptions often underestimate future technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:44:00">[38:44:00]</a>. Innovation will likely find ways to use fewer commodities and less labor than currently projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.

### Technological Advancement
Jim suggests that while technological advancement is secular and deflationary, the belief that it has suddenly shifted to a much quicker pace is a projection of a trend seen over the past 40 years driven by monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00:00">[45:00:00]</a>. This speed of innovation slows when the "lifeblood" of advancement (money, access to resources) diminishes, which tends to happen during times of populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:45:00">[45:45:00]</a>.

Alfonso agrees that extrapolating an accelerating technological trend might be dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:00">[48:08:00]</a>. However, he maintains that assuming no technological advantage or robotization in future commodity consumption or labor demand is too conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:23:00">[48:23:00]</a>.

## Central Bank Divergence and Its Implications

A significant theme is the increasing divergence in central bank policies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:11:00">[53:11:00]</a>.

*   **ECB**: The ECB's chief economist, Philip Lane, indicated 25-50 basis point rate hikes in July and September as the benchmark pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>. Andreas believes the ECB is far more trapped than the Federal Reserve in terms of monetary policy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:21:00">[55:21:00]</a>. He predicts a strong move in the dollar if the ECB fails to act on inflation, facing a huge struggle with communication over the summer as they cannot go much above zero on the policy rate due to the nature of the euro setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>.
*   **Fed**: Fed member Christopher Waller stated support for additional 50 basis point hikes for several meetings until inflation approaches their 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:55:00">[53:55:00]</a>. Jim expects continued dollar strength, with significant [[global_financial_stability_risks | global financial stability risks]] as a consequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **BoJ**: The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is on track to buy almost all government bonds by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:19:00">[54:19:00]</a>. Their inflation expectations are below 1%, making them less inclined to tighten policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:26:00">[57:26:00]</a>. Japan actually wouldn't mind an orderly depreciation of the yen to import some inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:57:00">[57:57:00]</a>.

This divergence means higher realized volatility in FX markets, presenting opportunities for macro traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:34:00">[59:34:00]</a>. The ECB is likely to prioritize preserving its inflation-fighting credibility and preventing euro depreciation over concerns about fragmentation (e.g., BTP-Bund spreads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48:00">[01:00:48:00]</a>. The Euro project itself faces structural risks as not all member states need the same medicine, leading to internal disagreements, as seen with Russian oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:23:00">[01:01:23:00]</a>. This shift signifies moving from a "collaboration game to a cooperation game" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:32:00">[01:02:32:00]</a>.

## Investment Considerations in a Changing Environment

Niels highlights that due to their starting points in financial markets, younger investors might find it harder to envision persistent inflation, while he, having started in the 1980s and witnessing the 1987 crash, remains cautious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He questions why a 40-year bond cycle would suddenly stop and why 10% or even 15% yields wouldn't return, as history suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. A major concern is the potential loss of trust in authorities and central banks to manage the economy, which could lead to unpredictable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Mistakes
Alfonso advises long-term investors to avoid two key mistakes to preserve their competitive advantage in harvesting risk premia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15:00">[01:05:15:00]</a>:
1.  **Improper Position Sizing**: Do not size positions without considering the underlying volatility of each asset and the prevailing volatility regime. For example, Ethereum or Bitcoin positions should not be sized like a Euro-dollar position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43:00">[01:05:43:00]</a>. Allocate a limited amount of capital proportional to underlying volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03:00">[01:06:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Assuming Constant Correlations**: Correlations do not remain constant across macro cycles. Investors should be very careful about correlations flipping and proxy hedging, which has been detrimental in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:13:00">[01:06:13:00]</a>.

### Importance of Hedging
Andreas advises two things:
1.  **Avoid Excessive Activity**: It is tempting to be overly active in volatile environments, but it often does not work and can lead to significant brokerage fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:02:00">[01:07:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Always Hedge**: Maintain positions in the portfolio that hedge against being wrong. For example, Andreas holds gold and crypto, not as long-term bets, but as a hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30:00">[01:07:30:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Alfonso concludes that there is no "Fed put" when inflation expectations and realized inflation are around 2% because the Fed wants financial conditions to tighten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25:00">[01:09:25:00]</a>. Andreas counters that an "ECB put" exists, perpetually, as long as the euro exists, which is why shorting euro-dollar positions is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50:00">[01:09:50:00]</a>.

The discussion emphasizes the increasing complexity and [[global_economic_and_financial_challenges | global economic and financial challenges]] of the current [[global_macroeconomic_trends | global macroeconomic trends]], particularly with central bank divergence and the interplay between fiscal policy, populism, and inflation.

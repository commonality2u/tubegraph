The application of "design first logic" is considered essential for [[building_and_evaluating_systematic_trading_strategies | system development]] in systematic trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. This approach prioritizes defining "golden rules" based on logic, rather than relying solely on statistical outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>.

## Design First Logic Explained
Design first logic dictates that a system's design must first be capable of exploiting the desired edge in price data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>. For trend followers, this means developing rules that are inherently capable of fully exploiting a trending price series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

Examples of these foundational "golden rules" include the principles of "cut losses short" and "let profits run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. Such rules immediately establish necessary design constraints, such as the requirement for an initial stop and a trailing stop, even before any statistical analysis is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>. This establishes the "logical constraint boundaries" of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>, with statistical reasoning later used to validate these logical constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

## Avoiding Overfitting and Underfitting
This approach directly contrasts with traditional data mining processes that assume no initial design principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:07">[00:56:07]</a>. Such processes might iterate through numerous possible design outcomes to meet specific statistical objectives (e.g., minimum compound annual growth rate, maximum drawdown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. However, this often leads to [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | overfitting]], where the model trains itself to both the signal and the noise in the data, potentially exploiting luck rather than an enduring edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>.

By applying design first logic, the chance of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | overfitting]] from the iteration process is immediately reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. Overfit systems degrade quickly in future price series as they lack an enduring edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:45">[00:44:45]</a>. While an [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | underfit]] system might fail to optimally extract a signal, it is still preferable to an [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | overfit]] model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.

## Related Principles for Robustness
The "design first logic" is one of several principles employed to reduce the likelihood of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | overfitting]]:

1.  **[[the_importance_of_simple_and_objective_trading_rules | Simple Models with Few Parameters]]**: Choosing [[the_importance_of_simple_and_objective_trading_rules | simple models]] (also known as "loose pants models") means they are less over-optimized to historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. This allows them to capture opportunities from a wider variety of trend forms, rather than being overly prescriptive to a specific class of trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
2.  **Visual Mapping Process**: This involves visually aligning the equity curve of a model with the corresponding price data time series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. Traders can observe if the equity curve responds appropriately to trending periods (rising) and stagnates or declines during non-trending (noisy) periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:23">[01:02:23]</a>. If the equity curve rises during non-trending periods, it indicates [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | overfitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. This visual method helps identify the least overfit models by correlating performance with logical design principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Multi-Market Testing**: Applying a single trend-following model across a diverse portfolio of markets (e.g., 60 markets) significantly increases the sample size of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. This eliminates the chance of [[challenges_and_strategies_in_improving_trading_systems_without_overoptimization | overfitting]] to the characteristics of a single market and ensures the model has universal application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. This also exposes the model to an array of different market regimes, which is crucial for robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>.
4.  **Using All Available Data**: Instead of separating data into "out-of-sample" sets, it's preferable to use all available historical data in the back-testing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>. This maximizes the model's exposure to various market regimes, which is more important for robustness than simply increasing sample size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.

In summary, the [[research_and_model_optimization | research process]] for developing robust trading models relies heavily on establishing a logical design first, which then guides the selection of [[the_importance_of_simple_and_objective_trading_rules | simple models]] and is validated through visual mapping and extensive multi-market testing, rather than relying solely on statistical optimization of past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

Karl Sakoff, Chairman and Founder of 13D Research & Strategy, shares his outlook on global markets and [[longterm_trends_and_profitability | long-term trends]], drawing on over 40 years of experience advising major capital pools worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:55">[02:37:55]</a>. His insights emphasize significant [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular]] shifts in the global economy and offer [[investment_strategies_and_market_predictions | investment strategies]] for navigating these changes.

## Structural Regime Shift: Inflation and Bonds
Sakoff believes the structural regime shift, particularly regarding inflation and bonds, remains valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:02">[05:54:02]</a>. He views the bull market in bonds, which lasted 40 years, as definitively over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:21">[07:06:21]</a>. Bonds are now considered to be "sold," implying a long-term [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular]] bear market in bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:51">[07:11:51]</a>. This shift has massive implications due to the vast amount of capital tied up in fixed income globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:24">[07:18:24]</a>.

### Drivers of Inflationary Pressures
Several factors contribute to this [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] outlook:
*   **Wealth Distribution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:04">[08:42:04]</a>: Historically, shifts in wealth distribution, like those seen in China (2009) and Brazil (2012), are [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Reshoring/Friendshoring** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:18">[09:02:18]</a>: Moving production closer to home or to allied countries is [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:08">[09:05:08]</a>.
*   **National Security over Economics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:40">[09:08:40]</a>: Decisions made based on national security rather than purely economic efficiency are [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Demographics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:16">[09:52:16]</a>: The largest retirement of the adult working population in the developed world since capitalism began is highly [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:06">[10:14:06]</a>. While robotics and AI exist, there are shortages in manual labor professions like carpenters and electricians that technology cannot replace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:19">[10:30:19]</a>. The doubling of the global workforce between 1980 and 2020 due to China's WTO entry, the fall of the Soviet Union, and more women joining the workforce is now reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:08">[10:43:08]</a>. This represents a significant [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular]] headwind that central banks cannot control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:08">[10:59:08]</a>.
*   **Commodity Underinvestment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:02">[09:34:02]</a>: The commodity sector is hugely underinvested, particularly for the energy transition, requiring massive spending on materials like copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:05">[09:37:05]</a>.
*   **Extreme Weather Events**: Good weather has blessed us for many years, but extreme weather events will increasingly influence the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:03">[09:27:03]</a>.

## Asset Class Forecasts

### Gold
Gold is expected to experience a "major breakout" in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. It has been trading underneath its all-time high for a long time, indicating it is "marking time" and "gaining power" before a significant upward move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>.

[!NOTE] Gold as an inflation barometer
Gold is considered the best parameter of inflation/deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Its bottoming in December 2015 marked the end of severe deflationary pressures, and its peak in August 2020 anticipated inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. The subsequent tightening by the Fed and rise in real rates caused a change in gold's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a>.

### Gold Miners
Gold mining stocks are believed to be the cheapest asset on the planet, with gold itself being the next cheapest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. The market cap of gold miners is $250-300 billion, which is seen as incredibly cheap given the industry's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>. A severe shortage of physical gold is anticipated when gold breaks out, which will benefit miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>. Gold miners typically go up more than bullion in a big move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. Despite gold being up 11% annually since 2011, miners are down 40% in the same period, indicating a significant discrepancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>. Their costs are now decreasing, and the reserve life of big miners has declined 30% in the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>. Gold as a percentage of global AUM is under 1%, compared to 8% at its 1980 peak, making it massively under-owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.

### Oil
The long-term outlook for oil over the next three to five years is very bullish, suggesting an [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>. The global oil picture is characterized by underinvestment in exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:59">[02:11:59]</a>. OPEC+ now holds significant power in maintaining oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:56">[02:39:56]</a>. Depletion rates of six to seven million barrels per day need to be replaced, in addition to meeting new demand increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. Shale production, which "saved everybody's day," is not expected to produce as it has for much longer, with growth rates slowing significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:38">[02:48:38]</a>. OECD demand for oil peaked in 2004, with emerging markets (India, Indonesia, Africa, Brazil) driving current and future demand increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>.

### Copper
Massive investment is needed in copper for the energy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. Copper exploration budgets are one-third below their 2012 highs in nominal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>, despite an anticipated demand increase of 13 million metric tons per year by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>. The logical assumption is a dramatic rise in copper prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:58">[02:48:58]</a>.

### Uranium
Uranium is identified as a similar theme to copper and oil, with prices accelerating to the upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:56">[02:57:56]</a>. There's a massive shift towards nuclear energy, with 22 countries declaring intentions to triple nuclear energy capacity at COP28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:05">[02:48:05]</a>. Due to underinvestment, there's a shortage of approximately 40 million pounds per year, and the price needs to be significantly higher to stimulate exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:48">[02:57:48]</a>.

## Regional Market Forecasts

### China
China's economy is described as the most competitive in the world, with a tendency to create excess capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. While there are current deflationary forces and concerns about "japanification," China is unlikely to follow Japan's path due to ample policy tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. The government has more policy room than most countries and is starting to use it, including tying compensation of State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) management to [[stock_market_outlook | stock market]] performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. The deliberate bursting of the property bubble caused repercussions, but the long-term outlook is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. China's debt is less concerning when considering the asset side of the balance sheet, with SOEs' net asset value being 70% of China's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Despite the working population peaking in 2012, GDP doubled since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

[!INFO] China's Investability
While China's [[stock_market_outlook | stock market]] is cheap, geopolitical risks pose concerns for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. However, investing in "deep value" and high-dividend Chinese stocks has yielded strong returns (42% since November 2021) even during a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Foreign liquidation has been massive, suggesting that those buying are more informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Hong Kong has been down for four consecutive years, an "historic extreme" that presents unique opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The Chinese government is taking economic challenges seriously and is implementing significant policy actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### India
India is viewed as highly bullish, similar to China in 1992, due to the "exploding vitality" of its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Prime Minister Modi's initiatives, such as connecting people to bank accounts, building infrastructure, and integrating the underground economy, have been transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Europe (Germany)
Germany has "shot itself in the foot" by paying three to four times more for imported LNG than it did for Russian natural gas, leading to a loss of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. European auto manufacturers will struggle to compete with Chinese EVs, which are significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Protectionist measures against Chinese EVs would face backlash and be difficult to implement due to German industry's significant sales in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### United States
The US economy's data is seen as "extremely conflicting," with discrepancies between GDI and GDP, and declining hours worked being more important than job creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The 1970s is considered the closest parallel period for the current [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | inflationary]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The US treasury is in a poor fiscal situation, and the unprecedented scale of central bank intervention (QE, QT, fiscal dominance) creates unknowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Protectionism
The US already has the highest tariffs since Smoot-Hawley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. Protectionism is generally seen as terrible and destructive, leading to beggar-thy-neighbor policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. While some believe it's just politics, the risk of increased tariffs and trade barriers is real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Geopolitical Factors

### De-Dollarization
There is significant frustration among many countries with the US's dollar hegemony, leading a desire to move away from the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The "confiscation" (freezing) of Russian foreign exchange reserves served as a "wakeup call" for countries holding US treasuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. There is evidence of liquidation of treasuries by surprising places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The "medium of exchange" function of the dollar is definitely shifting dramatically, with countries trading in their own currencies (e.g., China paying Saudi Arabia for oil in RMB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. The reserve currency status is considered less important than it once was, as central banks have stopped financing the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The need to hold large foreign exchange reserves has drastically reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. There are discussions about gold-backed currencies for BRICS nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This means less surplus capital being recycled into the US, implying higher yields and a more challenging financing situation for the US over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Artificial Intelligence (AI)
The adoption rate of AI is unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. While AI is undeniably significant, the question of "when it will be big" (now or in 10 years) remains open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. The valuation of the "Magnificent 7" (now "Mag 4") reflects a very bullish case, with valuations already high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. A parallel is drawn to the dot-com boom of 2000, where the internet ultimately changed the world, but valuations were initially too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### Climate Change and Decarbonization
Extreme weather events are expected to be the primary driver of climate change focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. A 500-year flood in Eastern Europe in 2002 signaled a shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. There is concern about a potential future "big tragedy" due to extreme weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The energy transition is a long process (50-150 years), and fossil fuels are deeply ingrained in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Long-Term [[Investment Strategies and Market Predictions | Investment Strategies]]

For the next 20-30 years, Karl Sakoff suggests:
*   Avoid owning bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   Maintain a high allocation to gold and gold mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   Invest in copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   Be very bullish on India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   Consider China deep value and high-yield investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   Like uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   Japan is doing well due to government support for the [[stock_market_outlook | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   Be positioned for de-dollarization and [[secular_versus_cyclical_market_trends | secular]] inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
*   Both gold and Bitcoin can benefit in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Advice for Investors
*   **Study History**: Financial history is crucial and provides immense insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Recommended books include:
    *   *The Price of Time* by Edward Chancellor: Discusses the dangers of free money and low interest rates distorting the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.
    *   *Lords of Finance*: Phenomenally interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
    *   *The Bubble That Broke the World* by Garet Garrett: Explains how problems of debt were tried to be solved with more debt (paralleling current times) and how the 1929 crash's impact was exacerbated by European bond defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.
*   **Be Patient**: Big money is made when you are patient and when everyone disagrees with your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Identify Anomalies**: Look for situations where something that should be happening isn't, or vice versa, as this often reveals the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Timing is Crucial**: Being "right too early" can be as detrimental as being wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Look for Seminal Events**: Pay attention to events that others might overlook, as they can be massive turning points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. For example, the 500-year flood in Eastern Europe in 2002 led to a focus on climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The Saudi-Iran rapprochement is another such "massive" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Live in "unprecedented times" with central bank intervention and fiscal dominance, requiring flexibility in approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

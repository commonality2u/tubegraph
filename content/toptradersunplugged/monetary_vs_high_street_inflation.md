Michael Howell, MD of CrossBorder Capital, discusses the critical distinction between monetary inflation and High Street inflation, explaining their drivers and implications for markets and asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>.

## Defining Monetary Inflation
Monetary inflation refers to the expansion of global liquidity, which is the total flow of funding or credit through markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It measures the balance sheet capacity of the financial sector, encompassing credit issued by banks and shadow banks, plus savings from households and corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

According to Howell, monetary inflation is directly linked to debt growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. He projects that if the US public debt-to-GDP ratio doubles over the next 25 years, public debt growth will be twice that of GDP, implying a 10-12% annual increase in global liquidity (monetary inflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

## Defining High Street Inflation
High Street inflation (or consumer price inflation) is a "hybrid or cocktail" that includes monetary inflation but also incorporates other factors such as:
*   Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>
*   Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>
*   Productivity gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>
*   Oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>

## Relationship and Divergence
While monetary inflation "goes into" High Street inflation, they are fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. Monetary inflation typically outpaces High Street inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

In the past 20 years, strong monetary inflation has not always translated into high High Street inflation due to significant productivity gains from technology and lower Chinese costs, as well as lower oil prices since 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. However, these factors may not be present in the future, suggesting that monetary and High Street inflation may converge more closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

The trend is towards a more embedded and higher rate of High Street inflation, even though cyclically there might be a downswing due to factors like the slowdown in the Chinese economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>.

## Investment Implications
Given the prospect of ongoing [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | monetary inflation]], investors should consider monetary inflation hedges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

*   **Gold**: Gold is identified as a proven hedge against [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | monetary inflation]] over centuries, not necessarily against High Street inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. Howell projects gold could reach $25,000 an ounce by 2050 if it keeps pace with the projected tenfold expansion of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin**: Bitcoin has also proven to be a "wonderful hedge" against [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | monetary inflation]] over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.
*   **Tips (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)**: If TIPS offer a real return of 2% or more, they are considered a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:25">[00:40:25]</a>.
*   **Equities**: Good quality equities, particularly companies with pricing power, are expected to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>.
*   **Commodities**: These are also recommended as part of an investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.
*   **The 60/40 Model**: The traditional 60% equities/40% bonds portfolio model "no longer works" in a higher [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | inflation]] environment because bonds tend to perform poorly, and equity prices become positively correlated with bonds instead of negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.

## Outlook on Debt and Liquidity
The global economy is facing escalating debt, which is a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. With $350 trillion of global debt and an average maturity of five years, approximately $70 trillion of debt needs to be refinanced annually just to maintain current levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. This refinancing requirement necessitates a significant expansion of liquidity, largely controlled by central banks and the availability of collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.

Failure to provide sufficient liquidity for refinancing leads to debt refinancing crises, which Howell argues have been the fundamental cause of every financial crisis in the last two to three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Central banks have been compelled to inject liquidity to allow debt to be rolled over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>. This environment is characterized by a "perverse effect" where rising interest rates, especially on government debt, can become an income transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

The debt-driven nature of the economy means that capital markets are primarily debt refinancing systems, with roughly three out of four dollars transacted in financial markets being for debt refinancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. This shifts the economic cycle to a 5-6 year period, driven by financial markets, rather than the historical 9-10 year capital spending cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

This ongoing need for liquidity is projected to continue due to aging demographics, rising defense spending, and existing welfare commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. Howell suggests that governments may be forced to "inflate away the debt" through monetary inflation rather than direct High Street inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. This process of increasing wealth for asset holders at the expense of wage earners can create social tensions, forming a "financial proletariat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

## Current Market Environment
The [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | liquidity]] cycle is currently expanding, having bottomed in October 2022 and continuing to move higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While the Federal Reserve's actions tend to influence financial markets due to the dollar-based system, the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) actions mainly affect the Chinese economy and, consequently, the tempo of the global economy and commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

The yield curve is expected to steepen due to increasing liquidity and higher term premiums, leading to a higher yield base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This is partly offset by deliberate duration management by the US Treasury, shifting issuance towards shorter-dated tenors and increasing bill finance to suppress longer-end yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Despite rhetoric of quantitative tightening (QT), Howell argues that effective QT has ended in the US 18 months ago, with liquidity actively being pushed into markets by the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. This expansion of liquidity has elevated financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

Looking ahead, the [[inflation_and_its_drivers_in_the_current_economic_climate | liquidity]] cycle is predicted to peak in late 2025, suggesting continued, though potentially maturing, gains for risk assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>. Key indicators to watch include the Federal Reserve, the People's Bank of China, and the MOVE index (bond market volatility), as low volatility and expanding central bank liquidity create a favorable environment for rising global liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

Building a [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | diversified investment portfolio]] is crucial, especially in an evolving global macroeconomic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many traditional investment strategies, such as the 60/40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds), implicitly carry a significant bet on continued peace and globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, this historical norm may not hold true in the future, necessitating a shift towards portfolios that can protect against increased global conflict and reduced globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The objective is to be prepared for a wide range of potential outcomes, rather than projecting a single one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Understanding the Current Macroeconomic Environment

The current macroeconomic environment is characterized by an "income-driven expansion," which differs significantly from the credit-led expansions observed over the past 30 to 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While rising interest rates are slowing credit creation and increasing debt service, this drag is not enough to overcome consistent income growth that translates into durable spending growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

In the US, household wage and salary growth is between 5% and 6%, and nominal spending growth is also around 5% to 6%, with a largely flat savings rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This income-driven dynamic is sustainable for an extended period, unlike credit booms that lead to unsustainable debt buildups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This contrasts with the debt-driven mindset that has often confused economists, including the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

### Inflationary Pressures

While growth is currently stable, inflation remains too high due to nominal spending exceeding productive capacity growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Although progress has been made on supply-chain-driven inflation, the rate of inflation has stabilized at a level inconsistent with the Fed's mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

A slowdown in an income-driven expansion would require a decrease in spending, which would likely occur if asset prices decline, making households more cautious about spending their existing income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This decline could be triggered by an unexpected shock or a sufficient tightening of financial conditions, either by the Fed or the bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. The typical sequence involves yields rising, asset prices falling, spending slowing, earnings slowing, and eventually layoffs and wage income decreases, which then bring inflation down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

### Structural vs. Cyclical Inflation

Many of the disinflationary structural dynamics that persisted for 40 years before COVID-19 are now largely gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. These include:
*   **Deglobalization:** A shift from a highly globally integrated period, partly driven by China's entry into the WTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Labor Market Shifts:** The movement of a billion people from farming to factory work in Asia significantly increased productive capacity, a trend that has largely peaked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Increased Global Conflict:** An unusual period of global peace, where the loss of life from conflicts was at thousand-year lows before the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is unlikely to persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. War is inherently inflationary due to material destruction and a pullback of globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Resolved Deleveraging:** Household and business balance sheets are generally in much better shape than 15 years ago, resolving the deleveraging dynamic and debt overhang from the post-GFC period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

These factors collectively point towards higher future inflation relative to the pre-COVID era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. The major question is whether the Fed will reduce domestic nominal demand to contain inflation or allow inflation to run hot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

### Demographic Factors

Demographics also play a role, as workers retire and continue to spend, while their production value drops to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. This suggests an inflationary pressure through relatively tight labor markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. Unlike Japan's deflationary period, which was largely due to overly tight monetary policy, the current US situation combines demographic shifts with different monetary policy choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. If the Fed aims for 5-6% nominal demand growth while the labor force expansion slows or turns negative, it will lead to higher prices unless there's an incredible productivity boom or significant labor supply from other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

The mentality of younger generations (e.g., Millennials) who have experienced underperformance in wealth creation compared to Baby Boomers, also influences this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. This leads to a desire for labor rights, protectionism, and different policies, contributing to inflationary pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

## Recommended Portfolio Approach

Given the changing environment, the 60/40 portfolio, which greatly benefited from secular disinflation and strong growth over the last 40 years, is unlikely to be the best approach for a future with potentially weaker growth and higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Most investors are not well-prepared for this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

[[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | Diversification]] is key to protect against persistent higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. A simple game plan for a long-term savings portfolio involves three core components:

### 1. Diversified Beta Portfolio
This starts with holding risky assets (not cash) because assets are expected to appreciate relative to cash over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>. A good diversified beta portfolio could involve:
*   **Equal Risk Weighting:** Distribute risk equally between stocks, bonds, gold, and diversified commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>. This contrasts with a traditional 60/40 stock-bond mix, which is 95% driven by the stock market due to relative volatilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.
*   **Inflation Protection:** Tilt the portfolio towards assets that perform well during inflation, such as TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), gold, and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>. The primary risk for most investors is inflation rising relative to assets, not just assets going down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a>. The current market is often tilted towards bonds, which do not perform well during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>.

### 2. Gold and Commodities
These assets are critically important diversifiers if moving into a period of higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.
*   **Gold:** For most people, buying gold ETFs is a practical way to gain exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.
*   **Diversified Commodities:** Instead of trying to pick specific commodities, it's better to invest in a diversified, balanced commodity index (e.g., CRB index) that is not overweight in any single commodity like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. This prepares the portfolio for various outcomes without needing to predict which specific commodities will perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

### 3. Diversified Alpha (Alternatives)
Adding [[importance_of_alternative_investments_and_portfolio_diversification | diversified alternative investment strategies]] can enhance a portfolio. A common allocation among sophisticated institutional investors is around 50% to alternatives, while a wealth advisory business might suggest 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a>.
*   **Non-Correlated Returns:** Look for true hedge funds or strategies that offer non-correlated returns, such as event-driven or arbitrage strategies, rather than private equity which can be correlated to beta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.
*   **Systematic Edge:** For retail investors or financial advisors, it's challenging to consistently generate alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>. Therefore, finding ways to systematically gain an edge, such as through trend following, is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. Allocating about 10-15% of a portfolio to trend following can provide significant benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.
*   **Accessibility:** The advent of ETFs has made many alternative strategies more accessible and efficient for average investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.

### Considerations for Alternatives: Fees and Taxes
When considering alternatives, focus on the tradeoff between the alpha generated and the fees and taxes paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. Traditional LP (limited partnership) positions in 2 and 20 (2% management fee, 20% performance fee) style funds, combined with top marginal tax rates, financial advisor fees, and platform fees, can significantly erode investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. An initial 10% gross return from an alpha fund can diminish to 1-2% after all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

ETF-style alternatives are often much lower in fee structure and more tax-efficient than traditional LP positions, allowing more alpha to remain with the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:15">[00:45:15]</a>. Institutional investors achieve low-cost access by investing in dozens of funds and negotiating lower fees, essentially creating low-cost index funds of alpha strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. The goal is to make these institutional-level portfolios accessible to everyday investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.

## Global Exchange Rate Markets and the Dollar

Global exchange rate markets are experiencing increasing divergences in fundamental conditions, largely driven by differing policy choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>. The US economy's higher inflation and stronger nominal growth rates are likely to lead to a "higher for longer" monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>. In contrast, economies like Europe and Japan are expected to maintain easier monetary policy for an extended period due to their structural and cyclical dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>. This policy divergence is likely to continue putting upward pressure on the dollar relative to other developed exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, countering general market themes about a potential US sovereign debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.

In such periods, volatility in FX and gold markets can create significant opportunities, as these assets tend to be more volatile than others like oil, which might exhibit clearer trends with less volatility due to factors like OPEC support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>.

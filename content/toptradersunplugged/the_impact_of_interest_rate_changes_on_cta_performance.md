The [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | impact of interest rates]] on Managed Futures (CTA) performance, particularly in a rising interest rate environment, is a subject of significant discussion among traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>. Roy Neerhoofer, founder and president of RG Neerhoofer Capital Management, offers a distinct perspective on how these changes might affect the CTA industry as an asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>.

## Two Facets of Interest Rate Impact on CTAs

Neerhoofer's view on the [[impact_of_interest_rates_and_bond_market_movements | impact of interest rates and bond market movements]] on CTAs focuses on two primary areas:
1.  **Performance:** How a rising rate environment will affect the profitability of CTA strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Protective Role:** The effect on the traditional role of CTAs as a portfolio diversifier and downside protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>.

## Historical Drivers of CTA Success

Historically, the greatest contributor to CTA success over the past 25 years has been fixed income, specifically long fixed income positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. The substantial decline in interest rates has been a major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:10:00">[31:10:00]</a>.

### The "Roll Yield" Problem in a Rising Rate Environment

A detailed analysis reveals that approximately two-thirds of the profits from being long 10-year or 30-year futures contracts came from the roll yield, not solely from the actual decline in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a>. For the last 25 years, the yield curve has been positively sloping, averaging about 3% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:00">[31:41:00]</a>.

However, if interest rates begin to rise, the roll yield becomes negative for short fixed income positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:35:00">[32:35:00]</a>. This phenomenon significantly complicates traditional trend-following strategies in fixed income:
> "This is a real problem because instead of having this beautiful smooth uptrend where you have the decline in interest rates and the roll yields all going in the same direction, well you're if you're short you got the direction of interest rates correct so the contract wants to go down but the problem is the roll yield forces the contract actually to go up and this destroys the trend you can't Trend follow in fixed income on the short side it just doesn't work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:25:00">[33:25:00]</a>

This implies that the profits previously generated from long fixed income positions due to declining rates would turn negative if rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:45:00">[32:45:00]</a>. This presents a significant [[challenges_and_trends_in_the_cta_and_managed_futures_industry | challenge for the CTA industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:01:00">[34:01:00]</a>.

## Adapting to a Rising Interest Rate Environment

Given the challenges in fixed income, CTAs will need to look elsewhere for profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:16:00">[34:16:00]</a>.

### Commodities
Commodity markets are one potential area, as they might rise with inflation during periods of [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets | rising interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. However, the relatively small size of commodity markets (1-5% of financial futures markets) compared to the trillion-dollar size of the overall trend-following CTA capital makes it unlikely to support the same level of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:01:00">[35:01:00]</a>.

### Equities
Another area is equities. There has already been a noticeable increase in the correlation of the CTA index to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. This shift is driven by larger managers adopting long equity positions to support industry growth in various environments, suggesting a move away from pure bidirectional trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:55:00">[35:55:00]</a>.

### Foreign Exchange (FX) Markets
Neerhoofer suggests that FX markets are the most likely driver of returns for CTAs in a rising rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>. They are liquid, volatile, and diverse enough to provide the necessary opportunities for CTA strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:14:00">[36:14:00]</a>.

## Impact on Protective Qualities of CTAs

The traditional protective quality of CTAs, especially in events like market crashes or illiquidity periods (e.g., Long-Term Capital's demise, 9/11, November 2008), largely stemmed from being long fixed income during periods of declining interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:49:00">[38:49:00]</a>.

### Shifting Correlations
If the secular uptrend in fixed income ends and rates begin to rise, it will be harder for CTAs to consistently maintain long fixed income positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a>. If an equity shock occurs while CTAs are short fixed income (as would be the case in a rising rate environment), it would lead to losses during a flight to quality, as observed during October 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>.
> "My point is I believe the correlation of CTAs will secularly shift not in the absence of any other change in strategy just because you're spending more time short fixed income than you were long fixed income in the big decline in interest rate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>

This shift in correlation, combined with some managers moving towards long equity strategies, indicates that CTAs may not offer the same level of protection as they have in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:29:00">[41:29:00]</a>.

### The Role of Short-Term Managers
Unlike longer-term trend followers, short-term managers are less susceptible to the negative carry trade on the short side of fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01:00">[01:00:01:00]</a>. They can get short fixed income without incurring significant costs, allowing for more flexible positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05:00">[01:00:05:00]</a>.

## [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | Market Volatility and Interest Rates]]

The period of Quantitative Easing (QE) has had a significant suppressing effect on realized volatility across all markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:04:00">[54:04:00]</a>. However, with the end of QE in the US, volatility has "exploded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:22:00">[54:22:00]</a>. Neerhoofer anticipates an environment where volatility will rise rather than fall over the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a>.
> "I believe that we are going to face over the next few years an environment where volatility is going to to rise rather than fall and that's going to throw a lot of portfolios that have been created based on the last five years of returns which is typically what people use out of whack because they're tuned to short volatility and declining volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:40:00">[54:40:00]</a>

This [[trends_in_interest_rates_and_potential_implications | trend has significant implications]] for portfolios tuned to short volatility environments, urging investors to proactively assess how their current allocations might perform in a rising volatility regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:01:00">[55:01:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[impact_of_shortterm_interest_rates_on_investments | impact of rising interest rates on markets]] and the associated [[impact_of_rising_interest_rates_on_markets | challenges and opportunities in the CTA industry]] are complex. While some argue that CTAs will adapt, Neerhoofer highlights the potential for fundamental shifts in CTA performance drivers and their traditional protective role, particularly due to the mechanics of [[the_carry_trade_and_interest_rates | the carry trade and interest rates]] in fixed income and the changing volatility landscape.

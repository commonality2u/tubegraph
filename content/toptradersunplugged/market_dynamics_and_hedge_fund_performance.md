This article explores the intricate relationship between prevailing market dynamics and the performance of hedge funds, drawing insights from systematic investing principles and historical economic cycles. It delves into the impact of inflation, interest rates, and market structure on investment strategies, particularly focusing on volatility.

## Overview of Current Market Conditions

The global market is currently influenced by several key factors. Officials from the Federal Reserve have been actively speaking, with the Saint Louis President James Bullard raising his view on the Federal Funds rate to between 5.20% and 5.25%, an increase from the previous 4.75% to 5% range, emphasizing this as a minimal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The Fed may face growing resistance from a divided Congress, with Democrats concerned about job losses and Republicans prioritizing price stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

Despite these hawkish sentiments, yields decreased, and U.S. home buyers experienced a significant weekly decline in mortgage rates in 41 years, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate falling to 6.61% from 7.08% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Interest rate expectations are a primary driver of current market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

[[volatility_and_market_dynamics | Volatility]] has been a notable feature, especially around this time of year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The London Metal Exchange (LME) hiked initial margin by 28% on nickel due to heavy [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

Key takeaways from recent events also include:
*   **U.S. Elections:** Democrats' significant outperformance in the midterm cycle, winning the Senate and coming close in the House <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This political dynamic is considered important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **CPI Data:** A weaker-than-expected CPI print triggered a massive rally, marking the biggest one-day rally of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Seasonality:** The holiday season brings typical seasonality, influenced by factors like low liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Hedge Fund Performance and Industry Trends

From a broad perspective, [[evaluating_hedge_fund_performance | hedge funds]] have performed quite well, especially relative to equity and bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. While there have been specific areas of underperformance, such as long [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] strategies, the overall trend is positive for active managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

There is an expectation for a broader move from traditional asset management into alternatives, including trend following and other non-correlated investments, over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Major hedge funds are currently at capacity and struggling to deploy capital, indicating a wall of money entering the space rather than redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. New funds are also launching, often as offshoots of existing successful ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Trend Following Perspective

For trend following, the recent period has been a "correction week," with major trends in fixed income, currencies, and energies moving against existing positions, causing some pain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This is considered normal as trends do not move in a straight line and require space to fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. As of mid-November, few markets have provided positive contribution, and the trend barometer remains weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Performance figures (as of Wednesday):
*   Beta 50 index: Down 4.1% for the month, still up 15% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   Stockton CTA index: Down 4.5% for the month, still up 21% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   SocGen Trend index: Down about 5%, still up 29% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Stockton Short-Term Traders index: Down 0.75%, still up 11.75% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   MSCI World: Up 3.75% for the month, still down 18.25% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   Government bonds: Up 1.44% for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   S&P 500: Up 2% for the month, down 17% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Market Dynamics in an Inflationary Period

### Cyclical vs. Secular Inflation

A significant distinction is drawn between cyclical and secular inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. While the bond market and algorithms often focus on short-term cyclical effects, a secular trend of disinflation has dominated for 40 years, leading to monetary policy dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The recent CPI print, while a surprise relative to expectations, aligned with expectations of some cyclical good news on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>.

However, the current inversion of the yield curve is viewed differently during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. A recession could coincide with continued longer-term increasing inflation (stagflation), a scenario often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Historical Context: The 1970s

Comparing the current environment to the 1970s is crucial for understanding secular inflation.
*   During 1969-1970, inflation dropped from 6.5% to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. The Fed Funds rate, under Chairman William McChesney Martin, increased from 3.5-4% to 10% to achieve this, a much larger increase than seen recently (zero to four percent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This recession was shallow, but it was only the beginning of a larger secular inflationary push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.
*   From 1973-1975, inflation surged from 3% to 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>. The Fed Funds rate, under Arthur Burns, rose to 14%, before dropping to 5% during a deep recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>. However, the floor for interest rates continued to rise, eventually leading to 20% inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

Despite the recent inflationary push, the U.S. has been able to export inflation due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown outside the U.S., which has had cyclical disinflationary effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. However, a falling dollar and China's reopening are expected to re-import inflation and drive commodity prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

### Asset Class Performance in Secular Inflation

During secularly inflationary periods, different asset classes exhibit distinct performance characteristics:
*   **Equities:** Despite the first-order effect of inflation theoretically boosting asset prices, equities tend to have less upside drift due to second-order effects on flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. From 1967-1982, the market went nowhere in nominal terms, losing 70% of its value in real terms, even though the economy saw above-trend GDP growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Volatility (Long-term):** Inflation paradoxically reduces long-term [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] by compressing upside drift and cushioning declines, as assets become significantly cheaper due to inflation and strong revenue growth in demand-push economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.
    *   **Second-Order Effects (Negative for Equities):** These include a reduction in money available for investment, the "reverse TINA" effect (investors moving from equities to bonds for higher yields), and the discounting of future cash flows, which particularly impacts growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.
*   **Gold:** Gold and other precious metals are expected to perform well during such periods as a store of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.
*   **Oil and Dollar:** Both tend to benefit from first-order effects as stores of wealth and during times of geopolitical strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:41">[01:04:41]</a>. They exhibit upside drift over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.
    *   **Dollar:** Its [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] tends to increase because the Fed has less control due to its dual mandate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:59">[01:04:59]</a>.
    *   **Oil (Commodities):** Ironically, [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] for commodities is expected to compress because entities like OPEC will defend prices, cutting off the downside, similar to how the Fed controlled bond [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. The U.S. announcement to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) at $72 acts as a "put" on oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>. This means a structural upside drift for oil but with compressed [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[01:07:57]</a>.

## [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | Volatility]] and Skew

[[volatility_and_market_dynamics | Volatility]] has distinct behaviors depending on the timeframe. Short-term [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] may increase, while long-term [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] might compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. The VIX index, being relatively new (18 years old), has spent most of its existence in a secular environment of falling interest rates, which could imply a different dynamic in an inflationary regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

### Implied Volatility Data and Risk Premium

There is no real implied [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] data from past inflationary periods, as puts were only actively traded from the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. However, risk premium tends to increase during inflationary periods due to less liquidity, which presents opportunities for those willing to warehouse risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

Long-term [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]], particularly in longer-dated options, tends to have an upward slope (contango) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. This provides theoretical opportunities to sell long-dated [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] to own shorter-dated [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. The explosion of long-term [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] has historically blown up the [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] market (e.g., 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.

### Skew and its Implications

Skew, representing the difference in implied [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] between downside and upside options in the equity market, is currently at historically low levels, reaching the zero percentile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

*   **Initial State (January 2022):** Skew was at the 98th-100th percentile, indicating high demand for hedging (downside options) due to events like the massive [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] event in Feb-March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   **Market Decline & Skew Collapse:** As the market declined, many investors who bought puts to hedge found them underperforming or collapsing, leading to forced selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>. This "Avalanche of selling puts" is counterintuitive but occurs when protection fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>.
*   **Impact on Realized Volatility:** This selling of implied [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] tends to pin realized [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]], causing it to collapse even during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:27">[00:51:27]</a>.

The historically low skew in an environment of potential global risks (e.g., World War III) is notable, implying that downside protection is the cheapest it has ever been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. This situation creates a dangerous environment where complacency, combined with high valuations, builds potential energy for a sharp market correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>. A large, reflexive move in [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] could unpin the entire market and force people back into hedging, similar to February-March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:34">[00:55:34]</a>.

## Liquidity and Risk Premia

[[understanding_and_managing_investment_risks_in_hedge_funds_and_ctas | Risk Premia]] generally increase during inflationary periods, not necessarily due to higher realized [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] but because less liquidity means a reduced ability to absorb risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. Fewer market participants in inflationary periods lead to higher insurance premiums for assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

The ultimate source of liquidity is changing. While the Fed remains involved, it has less control over liquidity in areas like the commodity space. A new "put" is emerging in the commodity market, where powerful entities like OPEC are expected to control [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] and defend prices, particularly in a period of resource scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a>. This structural change implies that commodity [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]] will be compressed, even as prices trend higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>.

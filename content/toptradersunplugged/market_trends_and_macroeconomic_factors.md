The "Systematic Investor Series" regularly takes the pulse of global markets through the lens of a rule-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Discussions often revolve around [[global_macroeconomic_trends | macroeconomic factors]] and their impact on market movements and investment strategies.

## January 2023 Market Overview

January 2023 presented a peculiar start to the year for markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
Initially, there was a general feeling of malaise in market sentiments, largely due to a disappointing holiday selling season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The stock market began the year trading at its December low, as [[current_economic_trends_and_historical_comparisons | economic data]] continued to disappoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Federal Reserve Actions and Market Reactions
The Federal Reserve responded to a series of weak Q4 [[current_economic_trends_and_historical_comparisons | economic reports]] and persistent inflation readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. They communicated a reduction in the magnitude of rate hikes from 50 basis points to 25 basis points, which they enacted on February 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Committee members also suggested that the peak of the rates cycle would now reach 5%, a decrease from the 5.25%-5.5% communicated just three months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

This shift in messaging paradoxically boosted investor concerns and influenced both stock prices and bond yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   The 30-year yield began 2023 at 3.96% but closed January at 3.63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This decline occurred as investors worried about an impending recession, believing the Fed would be forced to cut rates later in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Equity indices rallied for the same reason, with the S&P 500 gaining over 6% for the month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Despite this, the index remained 15% below its all-time high from December 2021, though it had rallied nearly 20% off its October 2022 lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Employment Situation and Recession Outlook
A "Catch-22" exists concerning the mid-2023 recession narrative: the robust employment situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Despite numerous layoff announcements, the unemployment rate, unemployment insurance claims, and available job openings continue to indicate a strong job market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This strength is attributed to factors like Baby Boomer retirements and a general lack of desire to work, contributing to a clear worker shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Traditionally, a recession results in a spike in unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. If the worker shortage persists, the Fed might be able to engineer a "soft landing" for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. There appears to be a disconnect between the Fed's statements and market interpretations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Broader Market Dynamics

There is a prevailing consensus that the Fed will achieve a soft landing for the US economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. However, past optimism regarding consensus views on [[global_macroeconomic_trends | macroeconomic factors]] has often been consistently wrong over the last 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The market and the Fed are engaged in a "game of chicken," with the market assuming the Fed is not as aggressive as it claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The rising meme stocks, crypto, and equity markets suggest that the Fed's attempts to curb inflation may be challenged by renewed wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

The managed futures space seems to be in a transitional period, with participants "hunting for signals" but lacking certainty on market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation and Behavioral Biases
The asset management industry, designed to move slowly, often fought the rise of inflation for 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. When inflation began rapidly, firms with standard 60/40 portfolios in late 2020 had a massive "low rates bet" across their holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Famous investors leveraged into low rates, making them vulnerable when inflation took hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

The difficulty in the market, particularly in the latter half of 2022, stemmed from people panicking and rushing to readjust portfolios to avoid benchmarking losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This herd mentality, where many piled into similar trades, led to more violent unwinds when [[market_volatility_and_economic_shifts | changes]] occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Correlations Between Stocks and Bonds

Historically, the inverse correlation between stocks and bonds, particularly observed in the 2010s, was influenced by Fed policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. When interest rates rise above approximately four percent, positive correlations between stocks and bonds tend to emerge over very long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. In 2022, both asset classes declined together, and in January 2023, they rose together, indicating a shift away from offsetting movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. This positive correlation poses a challenge for those building diversified models for the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

This observation suggests that the traditional 60/40 portfolio might be "dead," making alternatives like managed futures critical for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## The Role of Evidence and Trust in Investing

Investors are often conditioned to try and time the market, such as "buying the dip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. However, when it comes to strategies like managed futures or trend following, investors should rely on the evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:52">[00:54:52]</a>. While financial pundits offer predictions, the future is uncertain, and even central banks do not forecast crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

The indisputable evidence for managed futures as a strategy exists in data like the SocGen CTA Index, which covers periods like the dot-com crisis, the GFC, and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. The challenge lies in convincing people to desire this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

### Overcoming Investor Suspicion
Psychologically, when an investor desires a product due to its observable benefits, they tend to ask fewer critical questions, as they don't want to hear negative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>. Allocators are often suspicious of arguments presented to them, especially regarding models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. To mitigate this, it's better to focus on the desired outcome and how a strategy fits into a portfolio, rather than getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty of model mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>. By building trust in the investment manager's judgment, concerns about model intricacies tend to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

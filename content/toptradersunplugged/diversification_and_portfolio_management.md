Dunn Capital Management, under the leadership of Marty Bergen and its founder Bill Dunn, has been a pioneer in systematic investment management for over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Their enduring success is attributed to a unique, systematic, and data-driven approach to [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | portfolio management]] and [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Founding Philosophy: Data-Driven Trading

Bill Dunn's initial foray into the business was driven by a desire to find a better way of making a living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. His core philosophy, established in the 1970s, was entirely statistical, relying purely on price data to determine buy and sell signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This approach avoided subjective knowledge, leveraging the transparency and real-time valuation available in highly liquid markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Initially, Dunn explored equities, but the massive data requirements and limited computing power of the 1970s made it impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This led him to focus on commodity futures, where only about a dozen contracts were traded at the time, making data management feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. In those early days, Bill and his son Daniel would manually punch computer cards with data, rent mainframe time, and run analyses to generate trading prices for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Portfolio Management

Over its 40-year history, Dunn Capital has continuously evolved its approach to [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | portfolio construction]] and [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | risk management]], adapting to technological advancements and market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

### Shift to Portfolio-as-a-Whole Approach (2006)
A significant transformation occurred in 2006, marking a shift from a market-by-market approach to a "portfolio as a whole" perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. Previously, each market was analyzed individually, and trading signals were generated before combining them into a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. The new approach recognized that investors ultimately care about the overall portfolio performance, leading to the design of models that operate across the entire portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. This made the systems much more robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

Instead of running only three models per market as was done before 2006, the firm expanded to run upwards of a hundred different models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. These models are combined to generate a "strength" signal for each market, determining the trading decision for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This expansion allowed the system to look at hundreds of time frames and noise variables, enabling migration between shorter and longer-term trends, resulting in a more adaptive and flexible approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

The firm employs two primary algorithm classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>:
*   **Original Algo:** Always in the market (long or short), operating as a full reversal program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.
*   **Second Algo:** Can be long, short, or flat, and incorporates a stop-loss function (not price-based) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
These two classes, though somewhat correlated, provide better combined performance than either standing alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. The algorithms rely purely on high, low, and close price data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. Position adjustments are made daily based on market data and current positions, with a small threshold to avoid excessive trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>.

### Expansion of Markets and [[importance_of_diversification_in_portfolios | Diversification]]
The 2006 changes also facilitated the expansion into more markets within the WMA program, moving beyond just financials to include a broader range of commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The firm now trades 53 markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>. When considering new markets, three criteria are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>:
1.  **Regulated Exchange:** The market must be traded on a regulated exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.
2.  **High, Consistent Volume:** Markets must have high and consistent trading volume over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.
3.  **Uncorrelated to Current Portfolio:** The market should offer [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | diversification]] benefits by being uncorrelated to the existing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.
This ensures low risk and viability for exiting positions when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

The 53 markets cover all sectors, leading to a fully [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio | diversified portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. For example, 23% of their allocation is in agricultures, while only 13% is in currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. This contrasts with larger managers who might be forced into higher currency exposure due to market size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. Dunn Capital's diversified approach and unique methodology have allowed them to maintain strong performance even when others, particularly those overweight in financials, have struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.

## Risk Management and Adaptive Strategies

Dunn Capital places a strong emphasis on [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_investment_portfolios | risk management]], considering it a core driver of their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>.

### Value-at-Risk (VAR) Targeting
From the firm's inception, Bill Dunn established a Value-at-Risk (VAR) target: a 1% chance of losing 20% or more in a given month (22 trading days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This high volatility, high return target has been maintained for the original WMA program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Dynamic Risk Adjustment (2008 & 2013)
In 2008, the firm implemented dynamic risk adjustment, moving from targeting risk based on historical data to adjusting risk daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. A more significant development in January 2013 introduced an "Adaptive Risk Profile" (ARP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. This proprietary measure assesses the trendiness of markets, allowing the firm to change its VAR target daily based on prevailing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The better the trending environment, the higher the VAR target; conversely, if markets are less trendy, the target is adjusted lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>. This has reduced overall volatility from the mid-30s to 23-24% over a long period, notably without sacrificing upside profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

The ARP considers three main factors for each market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>:
1.  Whether it is trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:55">[00:30:55]</a>.
2.  Its [[correlation_and_diversification_in_investment_portfolios | correlation]] to other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
3.  Its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

### Drivers of Performance: Risk Management and Portfolio Development
Marty Bergen believes that the firm's superior performance, especially compared to peers, stems primarily from its [[diversification_in_investment_strategies | risk management]] and [[portfolio_diversification_and_construction | portfolio development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:14">[00:38:14]</a>. While the core trend-following algorithms might not be drastically different from others in the industry, the firm's ability to identify trending markets and size positions appropriately, while not over-positioning in range-bound markets, significantly impacts performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:40">[00:38:40]</a>.

## Organizational Structure
Dunn Capital handles all operations, including administration, accounting, and trading, entirely in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This decision is rooted in the firm's culture and a perceived lack of outside providers meeting their expected standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. This internal control ensures timely processes, direct interaction with investors, and significantly lower costs, as no service fees are passed on to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The firm prides itself on its tight-knit team, which is carefully selected for both intellectual and personal fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

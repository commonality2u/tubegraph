[[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | Systematic trading and trend following strategies]] involve rule-based investing approaches influenced by early pioneers in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. These strategies rely on algorithms and data analysis rather than discretionary human decision-making.

## Origins and Pioneers of AHL
A group of "extraordinary pioneers" in [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] and [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following strategies]] significantly influenced the world of rule-based investing, inspiring numerous firms to emulate their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>. Among these pioneers were Michael Adam, David Harding, and Marty Lewis, the original founders of AHL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Michael Adam and Marty Lewis later co-founded Aspect Capital, while David Harding founded Wynton Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. They have been described as "rock stars of the [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Initial Steps at Oxford
Michael Adam's journey into [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] began unexpectedly after dropping out of Oxford without a degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. He started working in his family's brokerage business in London, which specialized in selling the Mauritian sugar crop on the London market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Driven by "laziness," he automated his bookkeeping and chart-drawing tasks using an early computer and a flatbed plotter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This marked the beginning of his interest in computer programming and its applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Marty Lewis, who had earned a degree from Oxford, initially worked selling Japanese equities but spent his lunch breaks with Michael Adam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Having learned to program during university holidays, he found more enjoyment in coding an early Hewlett-Packard workstation with Michael than in his banking job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

David Harding was one of the few people in London at the time who believed it was possible to trade markets [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematically]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. He had worked for other CTA firms and had to draw hundreds of charts by hand, leading him to reflect on chart patterns and how to make money by trading markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. He had read extensively on technical analysis and believed markets were not efficient, making forecasting worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

Michael's father played a key role in encouraging them to explore technical trading models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Their first portfolio consisted of physical commodity markets like cocoa, coffee, sugar, and three base metals, with an initial investment of 25,000 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

## Founding AHL and Key Discoveries
The trio officially formed AHL in February 1987, starting with approximately 100,000 pounds in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. They initially grew the business through consulting work, which provided valuable learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. For instance, research on option replication was later recycled for guaranteed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:00">[21:29:00]</a>. The early success of [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] initially felt like a "happy accident" due to the uncertainty and periods of poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[22:12:00]</a>.

### Scientific Approach and Core Insights
The founders, all with a physics background, approached trading with an empirical and inquisitive mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. They saw themselves as "empiricists" who conducted experiments, enabled by their self-written software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. Their approach was different from the prevailing managed futures industry in the US, which often involved experienced traders encoding existing rule sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. The constant drive to experiment and improve led to innovations like moving to intraday execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

Key discoveries and insights included:
*   **Time-varying volatility and market normalization:** Using an exponential schema for assessing risk and normalizing markets, which is now a widely used regulatory standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. This robust method significantly improved historical time series simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
*   **[[Trend_following_trading_strategies | Trend-following]] as market making:** They discovered that [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend-following]] could model the profit and loss (P&L) of guild market makers, viewing it as a [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | systematic]] way of thinking about market making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of market access costs:** This insight led them to focus heavily on reducing the cost of market access, from sampling to execution, and establish their own trading desk to interact directly with the market floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

Technological advancements, such as affordable and powerful Hewlett-Packard computers, were crucial. These machines allowed them to run complex experiments that others could not, giving them an unusual advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

## Industry Perception and Challenges
In the early days, combining science with finance was uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. While scientists were being recruited into finance from the early 1980s, most were drawn to the orthodoxy of efficient market theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. The [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] industry was small and often met with skepticism and even "ridicule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:35:00">[35:35:00]</a>. The Economist, in AHL's first year, published an article claiming their approach would "fail" because markets were efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:51:00">[35:51:00]</a>. [[Systematic_investing_and_trend_following | Systematic approaches]] were considered "heresy" and part of the "lunatic fringe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:36:00">[36:36:00]</a>.

Starting a business as three twenty-something individuals was unusual, as there wasn't a strong entrepreneurial culture in their peer group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:00">[25:23:00]</a>. They were forced to recruit "raw talent" and young graduates because they couldn't afford experienced banking or trading professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:00:00">[29:00:00]</a>. This turned out to be an advantage, as these new recruits had no pre-existing "destructive" habits from traditional markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>.

## Man Group Acquisition and Legacy
Man Group decided to acquire a part of AHL in 1989 and the remaining part five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:51:00">[41:51:00]</a>. Man Group was attracted to AHL due to the success of their existing relationship with another [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic]] firm, Mint, seeing AHL as "valuable internal competition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>. Man Group bought a majority stake to ensure control, learning from a previous "deadlock" situation with Mint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:12:00">[31:12:00]</a>.

AHL's founders were motivated by Man Group's distribution network for raising capital and, crucially, their established market access, which was difficult to obtain cost-effectively as an outsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:40:00">[31:40:00]</a>. This led to "constant war of attrition" with Man Group's brokerage division, as AHL constantly pushed to reduce execution times and costs to maximize their "tiny edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:17:00">[33:17:00]</a>. This focus on speed and cost, now standard, was counter to the natural instincts of brokerages at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:04:00">[34:04:00]</a>.

Around 1989-1991, other similar firms like James Simons' Renaissance Technologies (Medallion Fund) and Ken Griffin's Citadel were also emerging, demonstrating the simultaneous global development of [[systematic_and_trendfollowing_investment_approaches | systematic and trendfollowing investment approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:32:00">[39:32:00]</a>. The emergence of technology and open financial markets allowed individuals with similar backgrounds, particularly from the commodity markets, to apply computational skills to financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:00">[40:24:00]</a>. Their experience with commodity futures markets provided a template for understanding newly opening financial futures markets, allowing them to quickly normalize data and exploit diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:51:00">[40:51:00]</a>.

Despite initial doubts about the long-term viability, AHL has become an institution, still carrying its founders' names years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. The founders' belief in encoding rulesets for robust money management and institutionalizing research and development contributed to its lasting success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>.

[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Systematic investing]], particularly [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]], offers a unique relationship with global markets. While often overlooked, it is described as a dependable and consistent investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Richard Brennan and Niels Kaastrup-Larsen regularly assess global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Overall Uncorrelation

Generally, [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] strategies, due to their extensive [[Risk Management in Trend Following|diversification]], are typically uncorrelated to any single asset class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>. This is because [[Trend following in Various Markets|trend followers]] invest across equities, commodities, bonds, currencies, and even cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:57]</a>. Over a 22-year period, the TTU Trend Following Index showed a very low correlation of -0.1 to the S&P 500, confirming its uncorrelated nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

## Conditional Correlation in Adversity

Despite the overall uncorrelation, a deeper dive reveals a "conditional correlation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. During sustained periods of adversity in equity markets, [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following]] tends to exhibit negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Tech Collapse (2002-2003):** As equity markets declined significantly, the TTU Trend Following Index rose sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Global Financial Crisis (2008):** The TTU index was negatively correlated as equities were "smashed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.
*   **Covid Decline:** The TTU index showed negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:30">[00:39:30]</a>.
*   **2022 (Ukraine war, China slowdown, rising inflation):** This period of declining equity returns has seen significant negative correlation with the equity market, leading to some of the biggest returns for [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following]] programs in their history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

Out of five key periods of adversity for equities over 22 years, [[Trend following in Various Markets|trend following]] showed clear negative correlation in four instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

## Conditional Correlation in Boom Periods

Conversely, in boom periods for the equity market, [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] programs often exhibit positive correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Post-Tech Bubble Collapse (2003-2008):** Both equities and the TTU Trend Following Index increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>.
*   **Post-GFC Resurgence (2011 onwards):** Significant positive correlation was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>.
*   **2014-2015:** Good growth in the stock market and even better growth in the TTU Trend Following Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.
*   **2020 - December 2021:** Both equities and the TTU Trend Following Index experienced significant growth before the adversity began impacting equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.

In periods of boom, there were four clear instances of a positively correlated relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.

## The 'Lifting Power' of [[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend Following]]

[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following]] offers benefits beyond traditional asset classes like bonds. While bonds historically provided a cushioning effect to dampen equity [[Volatility and trend following in markets|volatility]], they lack significant "lifting power" for a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>. Recently, the cushioning relationship of bonds has broken down, showing positive correlation with equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following]] is considered superior as an allocation measure because it not only provides a cushioning effect during equity adversity but also offers "bonanzas" during boom periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. This combination of positive and negative correlated relationships gives [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] a significant lifting power to the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:10">[00:45:10]</a>.

This lifting power is attributed to the presence of non-linear anomalies (outliers) in the distribution of returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>. Diversification increases the frequency of these outliers across a portfolio of markets, leading to improved compound annual growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

## Understanding Market Behavior: Convergent vs. Divergent Forces

The market behavior that enables [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]]'s performance is rooted in the "leptokurtic" nature of market distributions, meaning they are not normally distributed but have "fat tails" and a high peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a>. This suggests that market events are not entirely random and independent, but have causal correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

There are two primary ways to extract an "edge" from price data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>:
1.  **Convergent Practices:** These target the edge around the equilibrium of the market return distribution, where prices are stable and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Most trading and investment techniques, such as fundamental investing (e.g., value analysis by Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:27">[01:07:27]</a>, technical analysis based on repeating patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>, and high-frequency trading, are convergent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:08:49]</a>. Central banks also contribute to this by intervening to stabilize markets and suppress [[Volatility and trend following in markets|volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>. Approximately 90% of market participants exert a convergent force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
2.  **Divergent Practices:** These focus on the "left and right tails" of the distribution, characterized by non-predictive, reactive price following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. [[Trend following as a trading strategy|Diversified systematic trend followers]] are among the few who specialize in this, representing about 10% of participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

## Trader Impact and Trend Amplification

During periods of market stability, the imbalance of participants (90% convergent, 10% divergent) maintains equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:20">[01:11:20]</a>. However, when markets become unpredictable, convergent models fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Convergent participants are forced to exit positions, which amplifies trends in a divergent manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. Those who refuse to exit and instead average down, increasing leverage, face even more significant impact when margin calls force their exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:52]</a>.

This shift causes a "wealth flow" from convergent participants to divergent participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. [[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following]] programs, by design, cut losses short and do not become convergent traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:26">[01:13:26]</a>. As predictive models break down during uncertainty, the behavior of a large number of participants (the 90%) shifting to divergent actions creates non-linear amplification in trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:48">[01:14:48]</a>. [[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following]] programs become the major beneficiaries of this amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:53">[01:14:53]</a>.

## Why [[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend Following]] Excels

[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend followers]] perform well during both boom and bust periods because trading behavior alters when markets become unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:09">[01:15:09]</a>. When traditional models fail, traders revert to behavioral tendencies influenced by fear and greed, leading to sustained trending regimes that [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following systems]] are designed to capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.

[[Trend following as a trading strategy|Trend following]] systems are configured to:
*   Cut losses short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>.
*   Let profits run with trailing exits, allowing for potentially unlimited upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.
*   Trade both long and short, capitalizing on directional significance regardless of direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.
*   Prioritize capital protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

This design produces positive skew in trade distribution, characterized by many small losses offset by a few "big fish" (5-10% of trades) that significantly move the needle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:47">[00:54:47]</a>. While individual markets might be volatile, [[Risk Management in Trend Following|diversification]] across many markets smooths the portfolio equity curve by distributing these outliers across time, leading to optimal compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>. This inherent design and the adaptive nature of [[Trend following as a trading strategy|trend following]] explain its robust performance across different market conditions.

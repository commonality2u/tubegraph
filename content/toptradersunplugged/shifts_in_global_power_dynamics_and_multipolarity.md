The world is increasingly recognized as multipolar rather than bipolar, despite efforts by the United States to establish a clear bipolar structure for its own strategic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A bipolar structure, akin to the Cold War, or a unipolar structure, like American hegemony post-1990s, would simplify global dynamics and investment modeling, tending to be more orderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, that era has ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## The End of American Hegemony
The world known for American hegemony arguably ended in the early 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. For a unipolar world to exist, one country needs a "preponderance of power," meaning it can compel others to act simply by "picking up a phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. While the US remains the most powerful country, it no longer holds this level of commanding influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

The shift to a multipolar world is seen by some as negative due to increased conflict potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Without one or two dominant powers to maintain equilibrium, conflicts are easier to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, this new order can also foster significant technological and industrial innovation due to geopolitical competition, with governments investing more in true technological breakthroughs and domestic capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Drivers of Multipolarity
The change towards a multipolar world started around 2009-2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This shift is seen as a function of rising wealth inequality and populism, leading to protectionist policies, where "people are local but corporations are global" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

There are two main dimensions to this evolution:
1.  **Geopolitical Evolution:** The collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in a unipolar moment that is now ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
2.  **Economic Evolution:** A pendulum swing away from laissez-faire capitalism (the "Washington Consensus") towards more dirigiste, or state-directed, capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This does not necessarily reaffirm American hegemony or resolve multipolarity; the late 19th century saw a very laissez-faire system alongside a multipolar world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Investment Implications
In this multipolar world, investors should prepare for a higher frequency of military conflicts, but these conflicts may have less global impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For example, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict have faded into the background for most global investors, who are currently focused on the US election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This suggests that geopolitical events are fleeting and should often be "faded," while [[geopolitical_challenges_and_global_macroeconomic_trends | geopolitical trends]] should be invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

Current market conditions show the S&P 500 reaching all-time highs amidst higher baseline volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Inflation and Mispricing
A significant difference between the current era and the 1970s is long-term inflation expectations, which remain anchored despite profound changes in globalization, energy policies, and trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Gold prices, which are typically inversely correlated with long-term real rates, are currently over $2,000, suggesting that either gold prices will collapse or long-term inflation expectations are mispriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. The latter is more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

<div class="callout">
**[[shifts_in_market_dynamics_and_reflexivity | Mispricing Due to Financialization]]**
The financial markets' heavy reliance on derivatives and strong reflexivity contribute to structural mispricings, like that of long-term inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. While short-term market "flows" can dominate, long-term "macro" trends eventually prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
</div>

For investors, this suggests a focus on:
*   Commodities and hard assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>
*   Sectors benefiting from government spending, such as infrastructure, national defense, healthcare, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>
*   High-quality businesses with strong DCF values (Warren Buffett-style investing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>
*   Onshoring and nearshoring trends driven by deglobalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>

## Key Global Actors and Dynamics
### The United States
The US presidential election is a short-term focus for investors, acting as a "macro black hole" that bends time and space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. The Federal Reserve, by taking "left-tail risks" off the table (e.g., preventing bank failures), may be influencing market conditions ahead of the election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

Donald Trump's potential presidency might "land the protectionism plane" he initiated, allowing for trade and foreign policy deals, even with [[uschina_relations_and_geopolitical_dynamics | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This does not reverse deglobalization but creates a new stable equilibrium where, for instance, Chinese companies might build factories in the US Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. Chinese companies are already engaged in "enemy-shoring," investing heavily in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico to rebuild supply chains outside of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Europe
Europe's [[potential_geopolitical_risks_and_global_conflicts | energy crisis]] of 2022 and Russian aggression in Ukraine served as a "wakeup call," pushing Europe towards a more positive and self-reliant direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>. Europe quickly built LNG import terminals, gaining energy security and potentially an energy advantage in the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. This shift will benefit European industrials and defense companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

The existential risk to the Euro's viability is dissipating, as populist leaders in Europe no longer debate its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. Europe is seen as becoming more geopolitically aware, building capacities to meet threats, and increasing integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

### Russia and China
Russia is seen as having domestic constraints on its military ambitions, with public opinion indicating a desire to end the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. Russia is unlikely to launch new major offensives beyond securing the remaining parts of Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>.

China and Russia are not considered true allies, despite rhetorical agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>. China has maintained an arms embargo on Russia and has been equivocal in its support, even arguing that Ukrainian sovereignty has been violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>. China's primary interest is not to alienate Europe, aiming to drive a wedge between the US and Europe to maintain commercial relations and access Western technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

China is currently focused on domestic economic revival and is facing a period of secular stagnation, making it more dependent on external demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. China has also learned from the Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, particularly the impact of civil society and corporate withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>. There is no immediate "clock" for China to invade Taiwan, as its legitimacy is tied to its economy, not the resolution of the Taiwan issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

### The Global South
Countries like Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil, grouped as the "Global South," are increasingly aware that neither [[us_and_global_geopolitics | China]] nor the [[current_global_political_landscape_and_its_impact_on_markets | US]] are as powerful as the Cold War superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. This encourages them to be "geopolitically promiscuous," flipping between alliances to gain advantages from both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.

<div class="callout">
**[[market_dynamics_and_regime_shifts | Long-Term Outlook]]**
Over the next 10 years, the world will likely consist of 5 to 10 countries capable of pursuing independent foreign policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. This increased multipolarity means a higher frequency of conflicts, but not all will have significant global macro impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. This contrasts with US attempts to force a bipolar structure, which the rest of the world does not objectively support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. The shift marks the "end of a world" that was mentally comfortable for investors, but not necessarily the "end of the world" in a negative sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

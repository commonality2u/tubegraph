A new world order is emerging, characterized by significant shifts in global macroeconomics and [[geopolitical_challenges_and_global_macroeconomic_trends | geopolitical dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. Dr. Pippa Malmgren, an economist, author, and entrepreneur, highlights the critical importance of understanding these developments, especially in the realm of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:22">[02:01:22]</a>.

## The New Space Race

Space has become a significant investment frontier and a crucial domain for [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | geopolitics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:37">[09:07:37]</a>. The world is currently engaged in a genuine space race between superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:58">[09:13:58]</a>. Control of the highest altitudes with satellites grants the greatest capabilities on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:29">[09:18:29]</a>. Disabling an adversary's satellites can remove their guidance systems and capacity to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:05">[09:24:05]</a>.

## Space Warfare and Covert Operations

Conflict among superpowers has been occurring in space for at least four to five years, with the war in Ukraine being the most recent manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:22">[09:41:22]</a>.

Key examples of covert or strategic space warfare include:
*   **Kessler Syndrome** Russia has been intentionally destroying its own satellites, creating massive debris fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:49">[09:56:49]</a>. This debris, known as the Kessler effect or Kessler Syndrome, acts like "razor blades in a washing machine," capable of ripping apart anything in orbit and threatening others' capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:36">[10:04:36]</a>.
*   **Robotic Arms** China has demonstrated capabilities with satellites equipped with robotic arms that can "grab your satellite and hurl it into what they call the gray zone outer space," rendering it inoperable for communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:31">[10:22:31]</a>.
*   **Internet Cable Sabotage** An event in January (2022) is considered the start of the modern war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:24">[10:40:24]</a>. Russian military submarines allegedly cut a double internet cable near Svalbard, Norway, which is a crucial connection point for most satellites under 5000 miles high, including the International Space Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:19">[10:54:19]</a>. This act, potentially cloaked by a civilian vessel, was seen by military leaders as an "act of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:24">[11:43:24]</a>.

This type of warfare is "invisible" to mainstream media because there are no immediate "dead bodies," unlike conventional conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. [[potential_geopolitical_risks_and_global_conflicts | Geopolitics]] requires understanding these non-sensationalist, yet highly impactful, events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

Militaries have also increasingly outsourced operations to privatized militias to reduce costs, creating an "off-balance sheet" military presence that makes it harder to assess true capabilities, as seen in the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:23">[07:00:23]</a>. This extends to conflicts in places like Africa, which remain largely unreported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:05">[08:01:05]</a>.

## Beyond Warfare: Declassification and the Search for Intelligent Life

A fascinating development in the space domain is a growing consensus among superpowers that intelligent life may exist in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:06">[12:15:06]</a>.
*   **UAP Declassification** The U.S. Congress is compelling the Defense Department and intelligence agencies to declassify all sightings of UFOs, which have been renamed UAPs (Unidentified Aerial Phenomena) to destigmatize the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:07">[12:31:07]</a>.
*   **Scientific Endeavors** Dr. Avi Loeb, a prominent Harvard astronomer, is building his own telescopes to systematically search the sky for signs of extraterrestrial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:24">[12:51:24]</a>. He is also supported by the U.S. military in attempting to dredge what he believes is an interstellar object off the coast of Papua New Guinea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:09">[13:31:09]</a>.

The declassification effort aims to determine if unknown aerial phenomena are "one of ours" (advanced U.S. weapon systems), "one of theirs" (Russian or Chinese hypersonic glide missiles, against which there are currently no known defenses), or genuinely from "them" (extraterrestrials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:50">[13:49:50]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications and Future Conflict

The modern era is marked by increased [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical instability]] and a return to conflict, which some argue is a necessary catalyst for change and unity in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. While the prospect of nuclear events is a genuine concern for military and political leaders, historical precedents, like the Cuban Missile Crisis, offer a degree of encouragement that such outcomes can be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:23">[22:30:23]</a>.

Conflict acts as a "social leveler," narrowing the gap between the rich and poor and forcing a re-evaluation of core values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>. [[the_role_of_technology_in_future_conflicts | Innovation]] and ingenuity are highlighted as crucial in these conflicts, enabling less resourced actors to compete against superpowers, as seen with Ukraine's use of simple materials like yoga mats to counter advanced thermal imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. This dynamic parallels historical examples like Al-Qaeda's use of box cutters against sophisticated defenses during 9/11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:52">[19:22:52]</a>.

The rise of [[potential_geopolitical_risks_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical issues]] and inflation are seen as interconnected consequences of phenomena like excessive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:00">[26:11:00]</a>. The inability of public discourse to accommodate nuance exacerbates polarization, making it difficult to address complex issues such as vaccine policies, central bank decisions, or even social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:23:00">[53:23:00]</a>. This degradation of trust in institutions is evident in phenomena like the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:59:00">[56:59:00]</a>.

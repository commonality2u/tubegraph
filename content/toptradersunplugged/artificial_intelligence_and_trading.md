The impact of [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) and machine learning on trading strategies is a recurring topic, often met with both skepticism and optimism among experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

## Skepticism vs. Optimism
Rob initially expresses skepticism regarding [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]]'s application in financial markets, reasoning that if most people are poor traders, a computer mimicking human behavior might not fare better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:22">[00:31:22]</a>. He references the recent release of GPT-3, an advanced natural language model capable of complex tasks like summarizing a Shakespeare play in the voice of Groucho Marx or writing code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. However, he highlights that GPT-3's data only extends to 2021, and it often makes mistakes, which could be dangerous if relied upon for critical applications like replacing Google search or writing production code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Rob questions whether this new wave of [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | AI techniques]] will truly revolutionize the development of [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | systematic trading models]], remaining skeptical about creating a "completely brilliant trading model" that is not overfitted and ready to go in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>.

Jim offers a more optimistic long-term view, suggesting that evolution is a powerful, exponential force, and that sophisticated computers could eventually become an improved version of the human brain, free from inherent [[systematic_trading_vs_expert_intuition | biases]] that may not suit the current financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. He believes that [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]] will be a net positive over longer timeframes, leading to smarter people, better computers, and improved [[automated_trading_systems | systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

Mark makes a distinction: while the idea of [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]] has been "oversold," the impact of data science and machine learning has been "undersold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. He notes that advancements in supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for extracting information from data have significantly boosted trading strategies and insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. However, he cautions that converting these into a "perpetual money machine" through artificial intelligence is a different question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. He uses the analogy of self-driving cars, suggesting that while they may exist, human oversight will still be desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. Mark also emphasizes that any [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]] model is a function of its builder's choices and assumptions, requiring significant work and effort to yield a great solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

Allen acknowledges that some managers have successfully incorporated machine learning techniques into their [[automated_trading_systems | systems]], and he can see the potential given advances in computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>. However, he also points out that the discussion around [[impact_of_ai_and_technology_on_financial_markets | AI]] appears to be cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.

Niels recounts an anecdote where an individual's "Holy Grail" machine learning and [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]] system, despite initial fantastic results, "blown up" within a year of its recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:14">[00:40:14]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategies
Mark notes that the [[evolution_of_systems_trading | evolution of strategies]] is fundamentally driven by two factors: the cost of transacting and the cost of [[the_role_of_systematic_trading_and_programming_skills | computing power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>. He explains that early long-term [[systematic_trading_strategies | Trend following strategies]] were prevalent partly because transaction costs were prohibitively high for faster systems, and limited computing power restricted the testing of many strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:46">[00:40:46]</a>. This highlights how changes in cost structures drive innovation in strategy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a>.

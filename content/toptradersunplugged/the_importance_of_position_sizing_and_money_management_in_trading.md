The importance of [[position_sizing_and_risk_management_in_trading | position sizing]] and money management in trading is often underestimated by investors, who tend to focus more on entry and exit points for trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This aspect of trading, particularly within CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategies, is crucial for preserving capital and achieving long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Core Principles

### Capital Preservation
A key value proposition of hedge funds and CTAs is their ability to preserve capital through predefined exit strategies, such as trailing stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These plans ensure that capital is protected when markets weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### The Role of Position Sizing
[[position_sizing_and_risk_management_in_trading | Position sizing]] is considered a wonderful and critical component of any portfolio, whether it includes stocks, stocks and bonds, or a fully diversified mix of long and short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. It is argued that the methods of trade sizing used by systematic managers are far superior to those typically employed by managers in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The concept of "[[risk_management_in_trading | risk parity]]" is viewed as another term for the [[position_sizing_and_risk_management_in_trading | position sizing]] central to trend following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, advocating for [[risk_management_in_trading | risk parity]] at market tops, rather than at the initial trade entry, is seen as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Managing Drawdowns and Volatility
Managing drawdowns and volatility is a difficult but essential aspect of trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It requires a commitment to the trading process and a willingness to stick to the game plan, even when performance is poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This often means being willing to "suffer pain" and do what most people find hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Computerizing trades and having a division of duties (one group devises systems, another executes) can help ensure a disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

It is crucial not to try to eliminate drawdowns or aim for a winning percentage higher than the low 40s in trend following, as this can make systems less robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Volatility, especially during profitable periods, should be distinguished from capital risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. While giving back some profit is disliked, it's necessary to achieve significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. Tightening stops to preserve open profits, apart from systematic exits (e.g., 200-day or 300-day moving averages), can prematurely cut off profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## Key Learnings for Traders

*   **Commitment to a Systematic Approach**: Success requires committing to a systematic and [[importance_of_research_in_trading_strategies | research]]-driven approach, using objective information like trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. This also means being committed to executing trades without being swayed by external opinions or self-doubt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Optimization**: Trying to make systems "too good" or overly complex can lead to problems with sample size and optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. "Good enough" should be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. Adding variables to prevent drawdowns or only take "best trades" tends to lessen the sample size and weaken systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Embrace Losses and Drawdowns**: Losses and drawdowns are an inherent part of a winning system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. A winning system must be difficult; ease, comfort, and pleasure are often signals that something is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Focus**: Play for the long term and grow slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:05">[00:45:05]</a>. Consistency and discipline are more important than creating superior systems; even a substandard system followed diligently is better than guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Being more diversified is always beneficial, regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. All trades generated by a systematic manager are created equal if they meet entry criteria and are traded consistently across various markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. Diversification helps accumulate the necessary sample size for robust systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. While markets can be highly correlated, diversification still mitigates drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **The Importance of Entries**: Not entering a trade, especially after a series of losses in a particular market, is a significant failing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:40">[00:48:40]</a>. Filters, while seemingly helpful in backtests, can cause traders to miss major trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>. It's crucial to have mechanisms that ensure entry into a trade, even if the setup isn't "optimal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.
*   **Multiple Exits**: It's advisable to have multiple exits for trades, all of which should be medium to longer-term in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. This prevents being completely "bounced out" of a position or holding a full position during a crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

## Challenges for Trend Following

*   **Market Perception**: Investors often struggle to understand systematic trend-following strategies, partly due to the lack of a significant stock component in many CTA portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. They tend to desire complexity and constant research, which can paradoxically weaken systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Underperformance vs. Stock Market**: CTAs sometimes underperform stock market indices, leading to a perception that their capital preservation focus is unnecessary in bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Industry Practices**: High leverage, excessive fees, and high commissions in the managed futures industry have hampered its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. The failure to offer stock-only funds or to clearly articulate the benefits of applying trend following to equities has been a missed opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Changing Market Dynamics**: Markets have become choppier, requiring longer-term approaches and greater tolerance for drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This choppiness is attributed to an increase in trend followers and computer-driven trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Predictability vs. Price Action**: There is a fundamental difference between trying to predict markets (which is deemed impossible) and simply following price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. Trend followers are well-suited to handle market changes because they rely on price, not predictions or fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.
*   **Skewed Profit Distribution**: Historically, 85-90% of long-term profits in trend following come from long-side trades, not short-side trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This is because long trades can extend further, and low initial volatility can allow for larger positions that generate outsized profits as volatility increases with the rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>. However, it's important not to rely too heavily on past performance patterns, as future market behavior, including the profitability of shorts, can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **The "Cost" of Smoothing Equity Curves**: Extensive portfolio adjustment trading to smooth out equity curves or reduce "seeming [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]]" (which is often just volatility) has a hidden cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>. This can lead to larger losses and necessitate trading larger positions to achieve the same profit potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>.

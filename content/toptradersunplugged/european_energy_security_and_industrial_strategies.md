Europe has undergone significant shifts in its approach to energy security and industrial strategy, largely in response to recent geopolitical events. What was once seen as a period of vulnerability is now argued to be a catalyst for positive change. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>

## A New Geopolitical Reality

The world is increasingly multipolar, not bipolar, meaning more countries can pursue independent foreign policies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> This multipolarity creates an environment where conflicts can form more easily as there isn't one or two dominant powers maintaining equilibrium. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> However, it can also lead to benefits such as significant technological and industrial innovation driven by geopolitical competition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>

For Europe, Russian aggression in Ukraine "woke up Europe to geopolitical realities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a> and the understanding that they cannot solely depend on the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>

## Energy Crisis and Recovery

The [[global_energy_crisis_and_supply_chain_issues | energy crisis]] of 2022 was seen as a negative event for Europe, but it forced a necessary transformation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a> There were concerns that Europe couldn't build import terminals for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) quickly enough. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a> However, Germany, for example, built several terminals in approximately three months, a process expected to take two years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>

### LNG Supply and Future Outlook
Significant LNG supply is coming online from Qatar, Russia, Canada, and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a> This overinvestment in LNG infrastructure means Europe is projected to be "flooded" with LNG within two years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>

This influx of LNG will create a buyers' market, allowing European nations to leverage their position to negotiate prices, even playing off LNG cargoes against Russian piped natural gas. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a> This signifies an end to long-term take-or-pay contracts and oil-linked gas deals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>

### Nuclear Power
While some countries, like Germany, have opposed nuclear power, others, notably France, are building new reactors and expanding capacity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a> This means that even if certain territories refuse to build nuclear plants, their neighbors' efforts will ensure regional electricity supply. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>

## Industrial Strategies and Investment Opportunities

The notion that Europe will de-industrialize due to [[geopolitical_influences_on_energy_markets | energy market]] challenges is dismissed, particularly because new factories are built for long-term operation (decades), not just a couple of years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:38">[00:39:38]</a>

The impending cheap electricity in Europe over the next two years presents a significant advantage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a> European industrials, already adept at building machinery for capital expenditure (CAPEX) goods, are positioned to benefit from this, especially as global supply chains are being redesigned, requiring substantial CAPEX. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>

At present, European industrials are trading at a discount compared to their American counterparts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a> This suggests an investment opportunity for those looking to capitalize on [[economic_implications_of_deglobalization_and_energy_policies | deglobalization]] trends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>

## Geopolitical Reawakening and Integration

Europe is becoming increasingly aware of the threats surrounding it and is building capacities to meet them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a> This will lead to increased integration within Europe to create a unified geopolitical actor, beneficial for [[european_military_and_economic_strategies | European defense companies]] and domestic industrials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a>

The existential risk to the Euro, once a concern for investors, has dissipated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a> Populist leaders in Europe, while still anti-immigration and pro-cyclical fiscal policy, no longer debate the Euro's existence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a> This stability contributes to a positive flow advantage for domestic assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:57">[00:43:57]</a>

### Relationship with China
China is actively working to prevent Europe from blindly following the U.S. in its foreign policy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a> China wants to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Europe, maintaining strong commercial relations with European nations to access Western technology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a> This fluid relationship, where Europe maintains its independent foreign policy, is a key aspect of the current multipolar world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>

Despite the current strength of the U.S. economy, there is a view that the U.S. will underperform other markets, including Europe and Japan, over the next five years, not due to American decline, but due to macro setups. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a>

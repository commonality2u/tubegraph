[[Systematic investing | Systematic investing]] is described as a dependable and consistent, yet often overlooked, [[investment strategies and asset allocation | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This approach involves a raw and honest journey into the world of [[systematic investing | systematic investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Rob's Portfolio Performance (Year-to-Date)

A real-space investor, Rob, discusses his portfolio performance for the year, noting a significant improvement since mid-July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

*   **Overall Performance**
    *   Down for the year around June, but performance improved significantly since mid-July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   Currently up approximately 10% for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This compares favorably with industry benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Rob has been tracking his performance since he began trading his own money about nine and a half years ago, generally performing ahead of indices over the long term, though annual results can vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Sector Contributions**
    *   **Bonds and Interest Rates**: The second best performing sector, contributing significantly positively to his profit and loss (pnl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. US 30-year bonds were one of his best performing individual markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   **FX (Foreign Exchange)**: The best performing sector overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. He made significant gains from the Renminbi-Dollar, Yen-Dollar, and Aussie Dollar currency pairs, particularly the Asian currency complex versus the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Equity Markets**: Have been frustrating this year with no clear trends, often exhibiting a "sawtooth" pattern. While it's not a bad year for buying and holding, it's difficult for [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
    *   **Volatility Markets**: Performed poorly, indicating that volatility has been "crushed" this year. Being short VIX futures (betting on markets getting safer) has done very well, partly due to the "V premium" (people overestimating future volatility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

*   **Individual Market Performance (Volatility-Adjusted)**
    *   **Best Performing**: Orange juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Other top performers are agricultural markets like cocoa, robusta coffee, and sugar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Worst Performing**: Israel Shekel (due to geopolitical events) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> and Newcastle Coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

*   **Current Market Positioning**
    *   Substantially short the bond market (e.g., US 20 years, Bunds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   Short Swissy, Dollar Yen, and Pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

*   Soc Short-term Traders: down 1.72% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Rob's Outperformance

Rob highlights that his portfolio is less of a "pure [[Systematic Investing Strategies | Trend follower]]" than many, with about 60% in trend-following strategies and 40% in other signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This diversification helps smooth out returns, particularly in years when pure trend-following might underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. His intuition is that his non-trend components have contributed positively this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Term Premium in Bonds

Rob, a former fixed-income trader, believes there should be a term premium in bonds, asserting it's "common sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This is because people generally prefer liquidity (money now) and demand higher rewards for lending money further into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. While technical reasons can cause flattening or inversion at the very long end of the yield curve (e.g., pension fund hedging), a premium should exist for lending money for two years versus ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

The challenge lies in quantifying the exact level of this premium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The best approach is to analyze long-term data (e.g., 30-40 years) to determine an average level, similar to the Shiller CAPE ratio for equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. Historical data shows that 10-year bonds have on average returned about 2.5% more than two-year bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

In a recent blog post, Rob explored risk-adjusted returns within asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. He found that, generally, there isn't a strong relationship between risk and return *within* most asset classes (e.g., higher risk within equities doesn't necessarily mean higher return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. However, this relationship *does* hold true *across* asset classes (e.g., commodities are riskier than bonds or FX, but tend to yield more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. The Sharpe ratios across different asset classes are broadly similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

The **exception to this rule is bonds**: there is a very strong relationship between risk and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Longer-duration bonds, which are riskier due to higher sensitivity to interest rates (duration), generally earn more than lower-duration bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. On a risk-adjusted (Sharpe ratio) basis, they are fairly similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. However, this relationship seems to break down beyond 10-20 years, with 30-year bonds sometimes performing worse than 5-year bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Very long-duration bonds may offer a lot of volatility but not much return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Complementing Trend Following with Other [[Systematic Investing Strategies | Systematic Strategies]]

Rob discusses the idea of using other [[Systematic investing strategies | systematic strategies]] to complement [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] and fill "pot holes" in the equity curve.

*   **Mean Reversion Strategies**
    *   At the same timeframe, mean reversion strategies are perfectly negatively correlated with [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]], offering excellent diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.
    *   However, simply flipping a [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] signal to mean revert at the same frequency would likely lead to losses because [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] is profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
    *   The goal is to find areas where [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] doesn't work as well and mean reversion does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
    *   **Relative Value Trading**: This involves looking at the relationship between two assets that might otherwise trend well, but their relative value is mean reverting (e.g., bond butterflies - 2, 5, and 10-year points on the yield curve) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
    *   **Different Time Frequencies**:
        *   **Slow Value Trade (Long-Term Mean Reversion)**: This assumes prices will revert to an equilibrium. It can be implemented by buying when prices are significantly below their five-year average and selling when above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
            *   **Downside**: Slower trading strategies generally have lower expected returns due to fewer opportunities (e.g., a Sharpe ratio of 0.2, compared to 1.0 for [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]]), making them close to statistically insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. They typically receive small risk allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>.
        *   **Shorter-Term Mean Reversion**: While [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] performance degrades at faster holding periods (e.g., less than a month), mean reversion can be profitable in these shorter timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
            *   **Costs**: Faster trading frequencies incur higher transaction costs, as more aggressive execution is often required to enter/exit positions quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. This can be mitigated by focusing on markets with cheaper trading costs, like equity indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.
            *   **Risk Management**: Much harder for mean reversion. If a trade moves against you, the system might suggest buying more, which can be ruinous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a>. Explicit stop losses are often necessary, which adds complexity to calibration and re-entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. [[systematic investing and trend following | Trend following]] naturally manages risk by reversing positions when trends change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
            *   **Autocorrelation**: Futures returns show strong negative autocorrelation for one to two hours, indicating that mean reversion could work well at that frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. This means if the price went up last hour, it's more likely to go down the next.
            *   **Execution Overlay**: Short-term mean reversion signals can be used as an overlay for execution within a slower system. For example, if a daily system wants to sell, it only sells if the price has moved in accordance with the mean reversion system (e.g., gone up during the day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.

## High-Frequency Strategies (HFS) and Modest Capital

[[Systematic trading strategies | High-frequency trading]] (HFT) and medium-frequency strategies can theoretically achieve much higher Sharpe ratios than lower frequency strategies employed by CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. This is partly due to the "Law of Active Management," which suggests that halving the holding period can theoretically double returns (by the square root of two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

*   **Challenges of HFS**
    *   **Costs**: As discussed, transaction costs rise sharply with increased frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>. Aggressive execution tactics needed for fast strategies (e.g., holding for an hour) mean always crossing the spread, drastically increasing trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
    *   **Degrading Performance**: Simply speeding up a [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]] system can lead to worse performance, not better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
    *   **Barriers to Entry**: High-frequency trading (HFT) requires significant technological investment and expertise to compete with established players like Citadel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>.
    *   **Limited Diversification**: Smaller accounts might only be able to trade a few instruments with HFT, losing the benefit of diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.

*   **Advantages for Smaller Accounts (e.g., $1 Million vs. $1 Billion)**
    *   The primary advantage is the ability to take larger risk positions in smaller, less liquid markets that larger funds cannot access due to capacity constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
    *   A "sweet spot" for capital is between $50 million and $250 million, where one can generally trade a diversified portfolio across most liquid futures markets without significant capacity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.
    *   Above $250 million, allocators become constrained, putting more risk into highly liquid markets like S&P 500 rather than smaller commodities, purely due to capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
    *   Larger funds (e.g., $3 billion) also have advantages like the heft to trade OTC markets and the ability to employ staff for operational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:34">[00:44:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>.

## Preventing Overfitting in [[Quantitative investment strategies | Quantitative Investment Strategies]]

Overfitting occurs when a [[Quantitative investment strategies | quantitative investment strategy]] assumes the future will be too much like the past by finding overly specific patterns that do not generalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. The goal is to maximize out-of-sample performance, not just in-sample (backtested) performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>.

### Detecting Overfitting and Measuring Robustness

*   **Subsample Analysis**: Look at the strategy's performance across different subsamples of historical data (e.g., by decade, or using random years/days via bootstrapping) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>.
    *   **Bootstrapping**: This technique involves re-sampling historical data (e.g., random days, months, or "blocks" of years) to create alternative histories. This helps assess how well a strategy performs across various market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.
    *   **Robustness Indicator**: A strategy is considered robust if it performs well across many different alternative histories, rather than just peaking in specific historical scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:20">[00:49:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Conditional Distribution of Returns**: Analyzing how a strategy performs conditioned on different market environments (e.g., low, high, rising, or falling interest rates) can demonstrate robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.
*   **Avoid Excessive Backtesting**: If one finds themselves running hundreds of backtests and constantly perfecting a strategy, it's almost certainly overfitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:33">[00:51:33]</a>. One or two backtests are generally acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>.

## AHL Trend ETF (AHL LT)

Rob expresses loyalty to AHL, his former employer, and generally supports democratizing the alternative asset space through ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.

*   **Expense Ratio**: Around 95 basis points, which is considered reasonable for an alternative beta fund and likely cheaper than a classic hedge fund structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:31]</a>.
*   **Instrument Count**: Rob's main concern is the low number of instruments (around 20) in the ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:51">[00:54:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. Diversification is a major advantage for [[systematic investing and trend following | trend following]], and 20 seems low, possibly due to legal or regulatory compliance issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>.
*   **Performance Degradation**: Based on his analysis, going from a highly diversified portfolio (e.g., 100 instruments) to a 20-market trend program could cut Sharpe ratios by a third to a half (e.g., from 1.0 to 0.5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. While there can be luck in short-term performance, in expectation, diversification provides a significant edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.

## Correlation Between Equities and [[Systematic investing and trend following | Trend Following]]

[[Systematic investing and trend following | Trend following]] strategies and equities tend to be highly positively correlated when both equities and other assets (like bonds) are exhibiting strong upward trends, leading to long positions in both. Conversely, they are typically negatively correlated in an equity bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:24">[00:59:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:05">[01:01:05]</a>. It's not just about equities going up, but them going up with a clear trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

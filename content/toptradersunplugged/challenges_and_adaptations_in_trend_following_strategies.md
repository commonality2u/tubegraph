The landscape of [[Trend following strategies|trend following strategies]] has evolved significantly, presenting both [[Challenges and strategies in trend following|challenges]] and adaptations for managers over time. Discussions among veteran traders, including Richard Dennis, Jerry Parker, and Brian Proctor, reveal insights into these shifts, particularly concerning volatility, market conditions, and the discipline of adhering to systematic rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Volatility and Strategy Adaptation

Historically, the "Turtle Program" embraced the volatility inherent in their strategy's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. However, since the program's inception, many successful CTAs have adopted constant volatility targeting, aiming for specific levels like 10%, 15%, or even 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Richard Dennis, creator of the Turtle program, expressed that he never "quite understood the problem with volatility," suggesting that investors could modify their exposure by simply investing less money if volatility was a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

Jerry Parker, a Turtle founder and president of Chesapeake Capital, states that his approach has largely maintained the original philosophy, only becoming longer-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. He has "no interest in the targeting" of volatility, viewing it as a "more sophisticated way of taking profits before the trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Parker emphasizes that risking 50 basis points on a losing trade is different from letting a profitable trade draw down 500 basis points before a trailing stop is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Brian Proctor, a Turtle and managing director of EMC Capital Advisors, notes that in the late 1980s, investors were more accepting of volatility and drawdowns due to higher risk-free rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. As rates declined, investor appetite for volatility also decreased, leading to a demand for lower volatility products to fit their mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. While EMC Capital has slightly reduced volatility in its flagship program, they have developed newer programs with different volatility targets to cater to investor demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Exiting Trades and Market Behavior

A common [[challenges of trend following|challenge of trend following]] is giving back a significant portion of open profit when a trend reverses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Jerry Parker recounts that while trading for Richard Dennis, he focused intently on following the rules for exiting trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. After starting his own firm, he admits to deviating from the book on occasion, finding it "crazy" due to the unfamiliarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Parker largely avoided "great ideas" with small sample sizes and stuck with his systematic exits, avoiding discretionary trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

Brian Proctor found it "very easy" to follow the rules during the Turtle program because they weren't risking their own money, removing psychological pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. However, it became "definitely harder" to maintain discipline after going out on their own, especially during long losing periods, as there's an inclination to make changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.

## Current Market [[Challenges and opportunities for trend following in uncertain markets|Challenges]]

[[Trend following strategies|Trend following]] has experienced a period of lower returns in recent years due to fewer extreme trends and a contraction of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

Brian Proctor attributes some of these [[Challenges and strategies in trend following|challenges]] to central bank intervention and government policies that have reduced liquidity in many markets, potentially making it more difficult for professional money managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>. However, he remains "cautiously optimistic" as some commodity markets, like crude oil, still exhibit significant price movements that cannot be controlled by these interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of being involved and identifying upcoming trends, potentially allocating to commodity markets if financial sectors are not performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.

Jerry Parker identifies the lack of trending markets outside of stocks as a problem, not necessarily a system failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. He expresses concern about volatility targeting by large CTAs, suggesting it might have contributed to significant market crashes, such as the Dow gaining 1000 points in August 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. He theorizes that these large CTAs, committing to volatility targeting, may contribute to crashes when long-term trends reverse and volatility picks up, leading to many participants trying to exit at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.

## The Debate: Adapt or Stay True to Rules?

The question of whether to adapt [[Trend following strategy and its evolution|trend following strategies]] or remain true to original rules is a point of discussion. Jerry Parker believes that adhering strictly to the Turtle rules might have prevented him from building or maintaining a larger business, as it meant not making compromises clients might want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

Brian Proctor's key takeaways from the Turtle program were:
*   **Strict Risk Management**: Don't overtrade, take many losing trades, and hold winning trades until the trend is confirmed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous System Development**: Keep looking for new systems, blending different values and timeframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.

Richard Dennis states that if he were to teach a Turtle program today, he "wouldn't teach the same thing" because it's "just harder to do objectively now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. He notes that "exaggerated variables" have truncated trends, posing a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

Jerry Parker reflects on the "shocking" amount of research done that hasn't been implemented, and some implemented changes that in hindsight he regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>. He believes he "should have not changed anything" and views volatility targeting as a "sophisticated" way of programming the "bad idea" of exiting trades too early, which he used to do discretionarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:16:00">[30:16:00]</a>. He feels "very comfortable with an approach that's very similar" to what he used to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>.

A quote from a large European CTA suggests that no simple technical trading rule can consistently generate profits year after year, and that strategies must adapt to changing markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:00">[31:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>. However, Jerry Parker counters that short-term [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following trading strategies]] don't work, but there's a "sweet spot" that has worked for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:58:00">[31:58:00]</a>. He believes his [[Trend following trading strategies|trend following trading strategies]] naturally adapt to changing market fundamentals and economics, capturing trends beautifully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. He cautions against optimizing to recent data while ignoring sample size requirements, suggesting it's what clients may like, but not necessarily a good idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:55:00">[32:55:00]</a>.

Richard Dennis finds the claim that simple rules can't consistently generate profits "vastly overstated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:22:00">[33:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:09:00">[34:09:00]</a>. He recalls that 40 years ago, academia believed prices were random, but this ignored the obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>. While he believes things are changing, he argues that losing half the correlation of a [[Trend following Strategies|trend following system]]'s expectation might grind down profits, but it doesn't invalidate trends themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>.

Brian Proctor maintains that [[Trendfollowing Strategies|trendfollowing strategies]] do work and remains confident in their future performance despite difficult recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. He jokes that questions about whether [[Trend Following Strategies|trend following]] is "dead" often precede periods of good performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31:00">[34:31:00]</a>.

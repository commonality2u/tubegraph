The "Top Traders Unplugged" podcast, presented by CME Group, dedicated a special episode to the [[systematic_trading_systems | pioneers of systemic trading]] and [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following strategies]] who reshaped understanding of investment strategies through the [[the_turtle_trading_program_and_its_legacy | Turtle Trading Program]] experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>. This program gained renown through numerous articles and books, though its creator, [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]], had previously shared little about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Key Figures and Their Backgrounds

### Richard Dennis
The creator of [[the_turtle_trading_program_and_its_legacy | the Turtle program]] and original mentor to the "turtles," [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] had 14 years of experience as a floor trader before moving off-floor approximately four or five years prior to the program's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:20">[03:18:20]</a>. He realized the necessity of trading more markets than the one or two accessible within a pit, leading him to trade from an office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. His introduction to [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following]] began around age 17, when he started researching by hand using existing books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. He noted that he came to know other pioneers like Richard Duncan and Keith Campbell much later, after he had already begun trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### Jerry Parker
Joining the [[the_turtle_trading_program_and_its_legacy | Turtle program]] in late 1983 as part of the first class, Jerry Parker was initially working for an accounting firm in Richmond, Virginia, while pursuing his CPA certificate, intending not to remain in that field long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. His hobby involved reading books about the stock market, watching "Wall Street Week," and following Marty Zweig's newsletters, which were influenced by [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. He was drawn to futures due to their leverage, diversification across currencies, commodities, and interest rates, and the ability to go short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. After seeing an article about [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] in Business Week, he saw the advertisement for the [[the_turtle_trading_program_and_its_legacy | Turtle program]] in The Wall Street Journal in August or September 1983, believing it to be a legitimate opportunity despite seeming "too good to be true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. The article likely fascinated him due to the amount of money Dennis had made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

### Brian Plata
Brian Plata graduated in 1982 during a significant recession, which limited investment banking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. He met Maverick Lip, who ran an FCM (Futures Commission Merchant) for pit traders, and was introduced to C&D Commodities, a newly formed firm co-founded by Larry Carol and [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Brian began working for Dennis as a runner, phone clerk, and back office trade checker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. Witnessing the success of the first wave of turtles, he had a conversation with [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]], who suggested that joining the second round of turtles would be a better career path than trading in the pit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. This prior working relationship meant he did not go through the full formal interview process like other candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Brian later worked with Elisha Val, the founder of EMC Capital Advisors and a fellow "turtle," after returning from trading for a hedge fund in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

## The Name and Inspiration Behind the Program

### The "Turtle" Name
Myths surrounding the program's name included a connection to a turtle farm in Singapore or a rock band called "The Turtles." [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] confirmed that the name indeed originated from seeing turtles in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. He described it as a "misnomer" that "sort of stuck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

### Genesis of the Idea
A popular myth suggested the program was inspired by the movie *Trading Places*, where a bet was made about training anyone to be a successful trader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] unequivocally denied this, stating "Heavens no on that one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

The true inspiration came to [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] one Sunday afternoon while reflecting on his own trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. He realized much of his trading relied on informal rules and observed that other traders also followed rules, some of which were detrimental (e.g., "always buy soybeans") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. He estimated that two-thirds of trading was about following rules, and one-third about intuition or "flair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. To resolve this question definitively, he decided to train people by giving them rules and discussing intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>. This idea quickly led to advertisements in newspapers, and the program began in January 1984, just a couple of months after the initial concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.

## Application and Training Process

### Application Process
Jerry Parker, one of the first applicants, saw the famous ad in The Wall Street Journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>. The process involved submitting a resume and taking a test comprising 100 true/false questions and discussion questions requiring one-sentence answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. Jerry spent weeks studying the test, even consulting friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>. After initially ignoring a phone call, he took a second one from Chicago, leading to an interview where he felt he showed passion and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>. Brian Plata confirmed that the process for the second class was "pretty much the same," though his prior work for [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] provided an advantage in knowing many of the answers beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>.

### Selection Criteria
[[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] stated there was no single "killer aspect" for selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>. He preferred candidates who had no prior floor trading experience, as existing knowledge could be a "detriment" if it wasn't aligned with their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>. Statistical aptitude was a key trait, leading to the selection of many professional blackjack players who understood odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>. While they sought general intelligence, Dennis admitted they didn't do a great job predicting success, with initial expectations often proving incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>. He concluded that success in trading, particularly for [[the_turtle_trading_program_and_its_legacy | the Turtle program]], required being "rule-oriented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

### Training and Support
Jerry Parker described the training as "great" and "sufficient," lasting two or three weeks, and emphasizing that it "could not have been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. A key component was ample time spent with [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] and Phil, including "trader for a day" sessions where they had lunch and traded with Dennis, allowing them to understand the underlying philosophy and approach to markets and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:08:00">[23:08:00]</a>. Parker highlighted the "crazy support" they received, an environment where doing the "right thing" was prioritized over immediate monetary returns, a stark contrast to typical client expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. He likened it to becoming a marine not just by reading a manual but through experience and mentorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>. [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] added that even "mediocre rules are better than good traders' judgment" due to the necessity of persistence, which [[systematic_trading systems | systematic trading]] ensures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>.

### Allocation and Media Attention
Initially, all "turtles" were allocated the same amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>. However, as their performance became evident, [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] introduced "asymmetry" in subsequent allocations, rewarding successful application of the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:00">[25:34:00]</a>.

[[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] did not recall discussing the program with the media while it was ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>. He expressed a preference for anonymity regarding the specifics of their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a>. An article in The Wall Street Journal from September 1989, after the program concluded, was likely one of the first media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>.

## Evolution and Modern Relevance

### Current Applicability of Turtle Rules
While markets change, much remains the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:49:00">[26:49:00]</a>. [[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] noted that a significant problem has been the "lack of volatility," which he finds more concerning than system adjustments, though adjustments are also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>.

Brian Plata stated that the basic [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | philosophy]] of [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following]] has not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. The goal remains finding "robust systems" with minimal parameters for trade initiation, liquidation, or staying out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>. This involves building systems based on momentum or range-dependent discrete time frames to confirm existing trends and capture directional price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>. [[turtle_trading_philosophy_and_risk_management | Risk management]] is paramount, handled through trade sizing and limitations in markets and sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. Modern approaches include an overlaying risk management concept based on marginal utility, which involves harvesting profits along the way—a departure from the original [[the_turtle_trading_program_and_its_legacy | Turtle Trading Program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>.

### Diversification and Portfolio Balance
Jerry Parker advocates for trading as many liquid markets as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:37:00">[29:37:00]</a>, with exceptions like the VIX index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. He emphasizes careful "risk budget" allocation among sectors and markets, noting that highly correlated markets (like multiple bond markets) should be considered together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>. Parker is a strong proponent of trading single stocks and not just indices, as it leads to smaller drawdowns and better diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a>. He believes it is illogical for CTAs not to allocate a significant portion to equities, long and short, as they can be the primary source of returns, especially during periods when they are trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>.

[[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] asserted that liquidity primarily dictates market choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. He estimated that a typical portfolio might include 15-20 commodities and 15-20 financials, a balance determined by where the liquidity is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>. He would not be concerned if the balance shifted to be more unbalanced (e.g., 25 financials and 15 commodities) if liquidity demanded it, as correlations across different commodities are often not very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:52:00">[32:52:00]</a>.

### Investor Adoption of Trend Following
Despite evidence showing the benefits of [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following]]—including access to uncorrelated markets, the ability to go long and short, and cutting losses while letting winners run—it remains a minority allocation for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>.

Brian Plata attributes this to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>:
*   **Volatility and Drawdowns:** The return stream of [[Systematic trading strategies | trend following]] often exceeds institutional investors' internal rules for volatility and drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Perception:** Investors often view [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading]] as a "black box," despite managers being able to demonstrate how they operate, predict performance in various environments, and explain their use of statistics and probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:43:00">[34:43:00]</a>. Brian contrasts this with discretionary traders, whose thought processes are genuinely opaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a>.

[[turtle_trading_program_and_richard_dennis | Richard Dennis]] added that the historically better performance of hedge funds compared to CTAs led to hedge funds hogging allocations, though this has changed recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>. He also pointed to a stock market that tripled in eight years as a distraction for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>.

Jerry Parker believes historical fees and expenses, coupled with volatility and a strong stock market, have been deterrents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>. More recently, the focus shifted to the size of a firm and the number of PhDs on staff, rather than market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:04:00">[37:04:00]</a>.

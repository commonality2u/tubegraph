Peter Bersin, Chief Global Strategist and Research Director at BCA Research, shared his perspectives on the [[2023_financial_market_analysis_and_trends | financial markets]] and the economy, including the evolving [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | impact of AI and technology]].

## Current Market Sentiment and AI Skepticism
In early August, markets experienced jitters, with Peter Bersin attributing the decline in equities to a "one-two punch" [00:04:56]. The first "jab" came from increasing skepticism regarding the overall [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI story]] [00:05:03]. This skepticism wasn't necessarily about AI's potential to boost productivity growth, but rather concerns about whether firms would be able to truly capitalize on it and generate significant profits [00:05:06].

One key concern is the convergence of many [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | AI models]], leading to questions about where the competitive moat or monopolistic power will come from [00:05:14].

## AI and Corporate Profitability
Firms outside the immediate [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI sector]] are currently not spending heavily on new equipment [00:10:47]. The idea of a stock market bubble potentially fueled by [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]] is a consideration for investors [00:16:25].

Regarding the ability of "Mag Seven" or "Mag Five" technology stocks to maintain high profitability levels, Bersin notes that while current profit margins might be justified by the compositional shift in indices, sustaining these levels is not obvious [00:30:30].

> [!NOTE] Challenges in AI Profitability
> If various large language models (LLMs) produce similar answers due to similar architecture and training sets, it becomes difficult to establish monopoly profits [00:30:52]. This raises the question of whether LLMs will be more akin to industries like airlines (useful but rarely profitable due to indistinguishable services) or web browsers (where competitive differentiation is minimal) [00:31:14].

There is no guarantee that profits from these [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | AI models]] will materialize [00:31:41]. For example, when Nvidia sells a chip, it books a profit, but when companies like Google or Microsoft purchase these chips, it's considered capital expenditure (capex) [00:31:50]. This capex might eventually need to be written off, potentially leading to significant losses [00:32:07].

## AI vs. Internet: Cost and Profit Materialization
A key distinction between [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | AI]] and the internet, as discussed by economists like Jim Jim Cavallo, is cost [00:32:38]. The internet was a low-cost solution that offered clear superiority (e.g., Amazon vs. brick-and-mortar stores) [00:32:38]. [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | AI]], in contrast, is an expensive technology, and its major breakthrough applications are not yet obvious [00:32:46].

For investors, betting on [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI]] requires assuming the most favorable outcomes will occur relatively quickly [00:33:40]. The internet, for instance, saw visible productivity gains from the mid-1990s but profits only largely materialized around 2005, a decade later [00:33:50]. If [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | AI profits]] take a similar timeframe to materialize, many investors could face disappointment [00:34:10].

## Potential Scenarios for AI Impact
Bersin anticipates a scenario similar to the dot-com era [00:34:45]. During that time, "picks and shovels" companies like Cisco initially held up longer than other internet stocks but eventually crashed when demand for their hardware receded [00:34:50]. He expects a similar trend for [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | large language models]], where demand for their chips will likely decline as it becomes clear that significant money is not easily made from their creation and maintenance [00:35:14].

Competition is also a factor; Nvidia's 70% profit margins are highly attractive to other companies, suggesting that their market share could be challenged over time [00:35:30].

## Long-Term Economic Impact of AI
The long-term economic [[impact_of_ai_on_the_economy_and_investing | impact of AI]] is highly uncertain [00:36:06]. While LLMs could be stepping stones to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which could lead to massive productivity benefits, it is not yet clear if they are. LLMs primarily synthesize existing knowledge rather than reasoning like humans, which limits their value creation [00:36:52]. There is also a concern that the quality of AI model output could deteriorate as more and more lower-quality training data is added [00:37:07]. This leaves significant scope for disappointment [00:37:31].

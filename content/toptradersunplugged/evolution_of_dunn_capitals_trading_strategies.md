[[dunn_capitals_systematic_trading_approach | Dunn Capital Management]] is recognized as one of the oldest and most successful [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic managers]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Marty Bergen, the president of Dunn Capital, shares insights into the firm's evolution and key research discoveries that have kept them at the forefront of the CTA industry for over four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Origins and Early Development

Bill Dunn's trading career began in October 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. After serving in the military and obtaining his graduate degree, Bill realized there had to be a better way of making a living than his defense industry job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. His core philosophy was (and remains) based on using mathematical or statistical data from market prices to determine trading decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

Initially, Bill focused on equities, but in the 1970s, the computing power was insufficient to process the vast amount of equity data efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This led him to shift to futures, as there were only about a dozen commodity contracts traded at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. In the 1970s, Bill and his son Daniel manually punched computer cards with data, rented mainframe time to run the cards, and then used the resulting prices for the next day's execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

The initial goal was to make money for himself and others, securing seed capital from co-workers, friends, and family who remain investors today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Bill didn't initially realize others were engaged in similar [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic trading]] activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, though contemporaries like [[evolution_of_chesapeake_capital | Keith Campbell]] were also active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Statistical and Price-Based

[[dunn_capitals_systematic_trading_approach | Dunn Capital]]'s approach has consistently been 100% statistical, without any use of fundamental data in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. The reliance is purely on price data because it contains no subjective knowledge, is transparent, and is easy to value positions at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Trading Strategies and Systems

Marty Bergen notes that Dunn Capital experienced a period of complacency before 2006, making few changes to their system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. However, the firm has implemented significant upgrades to its WMA program, particularly in 2006, 2011, and 2013, driven by advancing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

### 2006: Portfolio-Centric Design and Market Expansion

The most significant change occurred in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Shift in Approach**: Previously, each market was viewed individually, and the system designed on a market-by-market basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The 2006 upgrade shifted to a portfolio-as-a-whole approach, designing models for the entire portfolio and applying the same model to every market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This made the systems more robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Model Expansion**: Before 2006, the system used three contingency price models for each market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. After the changes, they traded upwards of a hundred different models, combining them to determine a "strength" (plus one or minus one) for each market, executed at the open of each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Market Expansion**: The firm expanded from financial markets to include commodities within the WMA program, as volume increased and electronic markets developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### 2008: Dynamic Risk Adjustment

In 2008, Dunn Capital implemented a dynamic risk adjustment, where they began adjusting their risk daily instead of targeting risk based on historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### 2011: Two Algorithm Classes and New Markets

The year 2011 saw further significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>:
*   **Algo Classes**: They introduced two algorithm classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
    *   The "original algo" (designed by Bill in the 70s) is always in the market, acting as a full reversal program (always long or short) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
    *   The "second algo" can be long, short, or flat, and includes a function that acts as a stop-loss, though not based on price movement like traditional stop-losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
    *   These two algo types have some correlation but are not tightly correlated, providing better performance when used together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   **Market Additions**: [[dunn_capitals_systematic_trading_approach | Dunn Capital]] added "meats" to their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### 2013: Adaptive Risk Profile (ARP)

In early 2013, a significant improvement was made with the introduction of the Adaptive Risk Profile (ARP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
*   **Dynamic VAR Target**: Instead of a static Value at Risk (VAR) target, the VAR target is now adjusted daily based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Trendiness Measurement**: The ARP assesses whether the current environment is favorable for [[trend_following_strategy and its evolution | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. The target VAR increases in better trending environments and decreases when market trendiness is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This measure is derived from market volatilities, correlations, and individual market trend strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: This change reduced the overall volatility of the program (from mid-30s to 23-24%) while notably retaining the upside profitability, unlike many in the industry who reduced both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Current State and Operational Strategy

Dunn Capital currently trades 53 markets, covering all sectors, including a 23% allocation to agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. They actively seek markets that are traded on regulated exchanges, have high and consistent volume, and are uncorrelated to their existing portfolio for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

The firm handles all operations in-house, including administration, accounting, statement preparation, and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This approach ensures timely service, direct investor interaction, and reduced costs, as no fees are passed to investors for these services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

Marty believes that the key differentiator in their superior performance, particularly in recent years, is their risk management and portfolio development, rather than the core trading algorithms themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Despite market changes and shifts in [[investment_strategy_divergence | sector weights]] preferences, Dunn Capital maintains a 100% [[trend_following_strategy and its evolution | trend following]] approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Every day, they determine desired positions based on market data, adjusting holdings daily with a small threshold to avoid excessive trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

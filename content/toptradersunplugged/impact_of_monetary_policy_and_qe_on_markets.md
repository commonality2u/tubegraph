The [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_markets | impact of monetary policy]], particularly quantitative easing (QE), and related governmental financial strategies like Activist Treasury Issuance (ATI), profoundly influence financial markets and the broader economy. These policies work by altering the distribution of debt held by the public and influencing market liquidity and risk appetite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Activist Treasury Issuance (ATI)

Activist Treasury Issuance (ATI) is a policy where the Treasury strategically shifts its debt issuance profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This concept gained prominence after a paper co-authored by Steve Moran and Nouriel Roubini titled "Activist Treasury Issuance and the Tug of War Over Monetary Policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

The core idea behind ATI is that the Treasury can influence markets by issuing more short-term bills and less longer-duration bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This action aims to avoid putting upward pressure on long-term yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Similarities to Quantitative Easing (QE)
The economic channel through which ATI operates is very similar to the Fed's quantitative easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Both QE and ATI work by changing the distribution of debt held by the public:
*   **QE** involves the Fed buying interest rate risk-bearing debt from the market and giving Bank Reserves in exchange, effectively giving money and taking away risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **ATI** limits the creation of duration-bearing notes and bonds at the Treasury, instead issuing more bills which are now very close substitutes for Bank Reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

In both cases, the public receives more money or money-like bills, increasing the money supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. There is also a lower supply of interest rate risk-bearing notes and bonds to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This mechanism is known as the "portfolio balance channel," suggesting a fixed appetite for risk in the universe; if interest rate risk is reduced, there's more appetite for other forms of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This causes liquidity to flow into more risk-seeking activities, stimulating markets and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### Estimated Impact
The impact of ATI was estimated to be equivalent to a one-point cut in the Fed funds rate, in terms of its effect on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. While material, this is not enough to be the sole explanation for significant economic or market responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. ATI has contributed to the buoyancy of the economy and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### Treasury's Stated Policy vs. ATI
Historically, the Treasury's policy framework dictates that it is not a market timer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Its goal is to achieve the lowest cost to taxpayers over the long term (decades), not to time short-term market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. This is partly because they acknowledge they could "get the cycle wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Risks and Future Outlook
A significant downside of engaging in ATI is the "term out" risk, where the Treasury will eventually have to undo the short-term issuance bias, potentially raising yields at an inopportune time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The IMF has flagged this risk, noting that overextended reliance on short-term issuance raises the risk of higher interest rates down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>.

However, the current increase in yields (as of October 2024) is not attributed to the term out risk, largely because the future of Treasury policy is uncertain given anticipated leadership changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Instead, recent yield increases are more likely due to the Fed misjudging the economic cycle and increased expectations of future deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

## Quantitative Tightening (QT) and its Impact

The efficacy of QE is hotly debated, with some arguing about the stock of the balance sheet versus the flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Similarly, the [[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_markets | impact of central bank policies on markets]] via QT is also debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

### Fed's Stance on QT
The Fed seems to operate under the view that QT does not have much impact, or at least that it has no negative consequences, contrasting with their view on QE being a "super policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. This is seen by some as "quite silly cognitive dissonance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. The Fed may take this stance to retain autonomy over policy or to allow for slow, gradual balance sheet reductions alongside funds rate easing without appearing to be hitting the gas and brake simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### Interconnectedness of QE and ATI
Since QE and ATI are so similar in their economic mechanisms, they should either both work or neither works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. The idea that QE works but ATI does not is considered internally inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Every financial transaction has an effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[01:00:11]</a>.

## The Concept of Neutral Rate and Policy Setting

The "neutral rate" is a key framework for how the Fed views policy, generally aiming to determine if policy is restrictive or stimulative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. While its exact level is unknown, it's generally believed to be above where the Fed currently estimates it, given persistent GDP growth despite supposedly restrictive policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>.

Market indicators, such as the five-year forward five-year TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) real interest rate, suggest a real neutral rate around 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:58">[00:35:58]</a>. If the Fed achieves its 2% inflation target, the nominal neutral rate would be around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

While a sense of neutral is necessary for policy, policymakers should remain humble about knowing its exact position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>.

## Broader Policy Views and Recommendations

### Critiques of Micromanagement
There is a view that central banks are too focused on micromanaging the economy and overreacting to small deviations in data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. Inflation, like the neutral rate, is a constructed and estimated measure with significant methodological choices and measurement error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. This measurement error often dominates small misses from inflation targets, making precise targeting "profoundly silly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>.

Instead, policy should aim for aggressive action only when inflation is clearly out of control or a recession is clearly imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>. Otherwise, if things seem okay, it's often better to let them sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.

### Importance of Supply-Side Policies
While [[central_banks_and_monetary_policy | central banks]] and demand management are important, government policies affecting the supply side of the economy matter enormously for how decisions are made and how GDP growth evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:39">[00:59:39]</a>. These policies, such as taxes and regulatory changes, affect the long-term growth path by influencing decisions on fields to enter, where to live, compensation forms, education, and business organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.

For instance, regulatory policy, especially related to climate, environmental factors, land use, and licensing, can impose a significant burden on GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. Regulations like mandating specific equipment in cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a> or creating separate regulatory apparatuses for industries like semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a> increase production costs, reduce competitiveness, raise prices, and can lead to lower potential growth and higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

The discussion highlights the complex interplay of [[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_markets | monetary policy]], fiscal policy, and regulatory environments in shaping economic outcomes and market dynamics. The long-term outlook for fixed income markets remains a concern unless deficits are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. While the US dollar and Treasury markets remain dominant due to a lack of viable alternatives globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>, long-term fiscal solvency issues, such as the looming expirations of Social Security and Medicare trust funds, will require difficult decisions within the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>.

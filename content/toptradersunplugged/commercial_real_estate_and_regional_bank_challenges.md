The commercial real estate (CRE) sector is currently facing significant [[global_economic_and_financial_challenges | challenges]], leading to concerns about the stability of regional banks and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Distress in Commercial Real Estate

Key indicators reveal substantial distress within the CRE market:
*   **Rising Delinquency Rates** Delinquency rates in CRE are rising materially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Office Segment Vacancy** The vacancy rate in the office segment has reached a record high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Deals are being made where offices once valued at $300-400 million are now selling for $10-20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.
*   **Multifamily and Other Sectors** Stresses are also evident in multifamily construction (apartment buildings) with rising delinquency rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, as well as in shopping and hotels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

## Impact on Regional Banks

This distress in CRE is particularly problematic for regional banks, which have high exposure to this sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. There is an expectation of another "flare-up of banking stresses" stemming from these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This includes startups struggling to access necessary credit, with many going bust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>.

Even if the Federal Reserve (FED) cuts rates, this may not have the expected "therapeutic impact" on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. While longer-term [[performance_and_challenges_in_bond_and_fixed_income_markets | bond yields]] already incorporate substantial easing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>, a paradoxical outcome could occur if mortgage rates decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This decline could unleash a lot of new [[real_estate_market_dynamics | housing supply]] as people who previously held onto their homes due to high mortgage rates decide to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. An increased [[real_estate_market_dynamics | housing supply]] will strain bank balance sheets, as housing serves as an important source of collateral for their lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## Broader Economic Implications

Beyond the immediate banking sector, these challenges point to broader economic imbalances:
*   **Housing Imbalances** There are imbalances in housing, primarily on the price side, where real home prices are 20% higher than in 2019, despite higher mortgage rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   **Consumer Side Imbalances** The consumer side shows an unsustainably low savings rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Imbalances** The budget deficit is very large, which will make significant counter-cyclical fiscal policy difficult next year given the unfavorable debt dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

Peter Bursin, Chief Global Strategist and Research Director at BCA Research, suggests that while the US does not have a glut of single-family homes like in 2008, there is a glut of apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. The average apartment vacancy rate has increased materially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>, and overall construction spending in the US is declining, despite an increase in construction workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>. This decline in underlying construction is a negative signal for future construction employment and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.

> "The lags are clearly showing up in commercial real estate so the latest data that I track very clearly shows that delinquency rates are rising materially the vacancy rate in the office segment is at a record high by by by a long shot at at this point so we're seeing like deals get made where like offices that were once worth 300400 million are being sold for like 1020 million uh so this is clear signs of distress which is problematic for regional banks which are highly exposed to commercial real estate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>

## Market Outlook

Peter Bursin's base case is that the Fed will begin cutting rates slowly, then aggressively once a recession begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>. The target for the federal funds rate next year is 2%, and the 10-year Treasury yield is 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. This outlook suggests being underweight stocks and overweight longer-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>. This expected recession is seen more as an "income statement recession," requiring people to cut spending and raise savings, rather than a "balance sheet recession" like 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

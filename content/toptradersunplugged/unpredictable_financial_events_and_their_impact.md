Throughout the history of financial markets, the speaker has observed that every few years, an unpredictable event occurs that could not have been foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>. These events significantly influence the direction of [[global_financial_stability_risks | global financial markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.

## Historical Examples of Unforeseen Events
The speaker highlights a series of past unpredictable events and their impact on financial markets:
*   **Asian Currency Crisis** (1997) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>
*   **Russian Debt Crisis** (1998) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>
*   **LTCM Crisis** (1998) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>
*   **September 11th Attacks** (2001) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:35">[00:57:35]</a>
*   **Global Financial Crisis** (2007-2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:43">[00:57:43]</a>
*   **European Debt Crisis** (2010-2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>
*   **Chinese Devaluation, Industrial Recession, Brexit** (grouped around 2015-2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>
*   **COVID-19 Pandemic** (2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>
*   **War in Eastern Europe** (most recent example at time of discussion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:01">[00:58:01]</a>

These events are distinct; a war is different from a regular recession, which is different from a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. What might protect a portfolio against one type of crisis may not protect it against another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Implications for Investors
The recurring nature of these unpredictable events underscores the importance of strategic positioning in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. When positioning for the long term, investors must remember that "something always happens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>.

The initial period following an unexpected event (e.g., the first month of a war or pandemic) is crucial for identifying new trades and managing portfolio performance and psychological pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:46">[00:58:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. Even with personal feelings involved, portfolio management must continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

### Market Volatility and Economic Shifts
[[Market volatility and economic shifts | Market volatility and economic shifts]] often follow these unpredictable events. For instance, the speaker anticipated that the liquidity injected by the Federal Reserve during the pandemic would likely lead to an inflation shock, though they underestimated its eventual severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. The shift from a deflationary shock to an inflationary one, partly due to supply chain issues, illustrates how macro factors can unfold unpredictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.

### Challenges of Predicting Future Economic Challenges and Crises
Predicting [[future_economic_challenges_and_crises | future economic challenges and crises]] is inherently difficult. The speaker avoids making firm forecasts, instead focusing on constructing robust trades that can withstand various outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>. The belief is that if an off-ramp for the war in Eastern Europe were found, energy prices could collapse, leading to a reversal in commodity prices and, eventually, negative month-to-month inflation by the end of the year, pushing rates back to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:24">[00:51:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. Despite this, a recession is considered a very high probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>.

This perspective emphasizes a focus on understanding macro-level causality and relationships between assets rather than reacting to specific economic data releases, which can be stale or incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

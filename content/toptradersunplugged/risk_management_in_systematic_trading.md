Effective [[risk_management_in_trading_strategies | risk management]] is a crucial, holistic challenge in systematic trading, encompassing all aspects of a trading program from execution to portfolio construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. It ensures robust and repeatable performance, differentiating long-standing firms from untested ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07:00">[55:07:00]</a>.

It is essential to request and understand the specific risks from the investment manager about their product before making investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Past investment performance does not guarantee or infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Key Aspects of Risk Management

### Execution and Market Impact
Early in the evolution of systematic trading, high visibility and market impact were issues, leading to strategies being "picked off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Significant development and focus have been placed on execution to make trades smoother and effectively invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This involves dribbling trades into markets in random pieces and at random delays, exploiting market volatility rather than forcing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

Modern execution involves:
*   **Electronic Execution with Monitoring:** Approximately 96% of strategy trading is electronic, monitored 24 hours a day by an experienced trading team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Circuit Breakers:** Teams use thresholds or "canaries in coal mines" to identify sporadic changes in liquidity profiles, allowing the portfolio construction to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Algorithmic Suite:** A suite of execution algorithms is used, parameterized for market liquidity characteristics like bid-offer spread and typical clip sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:30:00">[23:30:00]</a>. These algorithms aim to obfuscate trading activity and capture a "patient premium" by not being in a hurry to get business done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Construction and Diversification
A key principle is an agnostic outlook, avoiding predictions based on historical performance or market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The starting point is broad [[diversification_and_risk_management_in_trading_systems | diversification]] across sectors, modulated by long-term structural correlations and market liquidity characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

*   **Market Coverage:** Trading over 150 markets and multiple contracts, encompassing around 180-200 instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Conservative Constraints:** Imposing conservative constraints on position size relative to average daily volume or open interest, especially during tail events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. This systematic process regularly determines portfolio allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Growth Capacity:** The program has considerable capacity for growth, with careful monitoring of how changes impact correlation structure and market impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Clear points are established where caution is required based on conservative constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Complementary Models:** While remaining predominantly medium-term [[Risk Management in Trend Following | Trend Following]] (80% of the portfolio), 20% of the risk is allocated to complementary models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. These "modulating factors" capture other persistent and diversifying factors, such as carry effects, term structure dynamics, relative momentum, or faster mean-reverting strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Volatility Adjustment
Position sizing is a crucial part of the "secret sauce" to the success and robustness of trend following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>. Positions are a function of signal strength and conviction, but this is modulated by perceived market risk (volatility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. For example, if market volatility doubles, a position might be halved to maintain the same risk for a given signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

*   **No Fixed Stop-Loss:** Rather than a strict stop-loss, the strategy uses a gradually modulating signal where position size adjusts with changing signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Madness":** There's a point where the firm backs off from increasing position size, even if a trend strengthens, to avoid excessive risk and potentially become a provider of liquidity rather than a consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:00">[18:08:00]</a>.

### Operational Robustness and Liquidity Risk
Concerns about [[risk_management_in_investment_firms | liquidity drying up]], as seen in 2008-2009, are addressed through multiple clearing houses and prime broker relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. This provides flexibility to move positions and continue trading if lines dry up with one broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. Operational robustness is continuously strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

### Model Risk and Review Process
Model [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]] is managed through a formal review process, akin to an academic peer review group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.
*   **Independent Risk Team:** A dedicated, highly capable risk team "shreds" the best research, examining every new component idea (e.g., trend following improvements, new strategies, execution algorithm amendments, portfolio construction methodology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:49:00">[27:49:00]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Testing:** Components are taken apart using out-of-sample data, synthetic data, and examination of failure cases to stress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.
*   **Holistic Release Review:** For typical three annual releases, the risk team reviews not only individual components but also the dynamics of the overall program, ensuring all pieces work together and that the portfolio doesn't concentrate in a way that would force discretionary intervention or exceed client comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:00">[28:37:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:00:00">[58:00:00]</a>. This process challenges whether the program could have been run historically without requiring manual overrides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>.

### Understanding Drawdowns and Investor Psychology
Drawdowns are an accepted part of running these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>. Helping investors understand that a drawdown is not an open-ended risk requires conveying its role as a diversifying constituent in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>.
*   **Uncorrelated Behavior:** Because managed futures are designed to be uncorrelated with equities and bonds, they will behave differently, leading to "idiosyncratic risk" where they might lose money when other assets are booming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:38:00">[33:38:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:10:00">[34:10:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:24:00">[34:24:00]</a>.
*   **Sticking with the Strategy:** It's important to stick with a strategy that provides utility to a portfolio, as "no one factor is going to work all the time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:11:00">[35:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:59:00">[35:59:00]</a>. Managers should focus on *why* they do what they do and communicate their beliefs to gain investor trust, rather than just *how* or *what* they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:45:00">[36:45:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>.

### Unforeseen Risks
While efforts are made to eliminate and manage [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]], some aspects remain outside direct control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:24:00">[37:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:26:00">[37:26:00]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical/Natural Disasters:** Events like terrorist attacks, hurricanes, or tsunamis can incapacitate an exchange or disrupt trading ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:22:00">[38:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:50:00">[38:50:00]</a>. This inability to trade is one of the most uncontrollable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:05:00">[39:05:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:11:00">[39:11:00]</a>.
*   **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Ensuring client money is as safe as possible and doesn't get stuck due to financial or geopolitical events is a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:26:00">[39:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39:00">[39:39:00]</a>.
*   **Complacency:** The biggest ongoing [[risk_management_techniques_in_trading | risk management]] challenge is never becoming complacent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Risk Management in Trading
The journey of [[risk_management_and_system_development_in_trading | risk management]] has involved continuous learning. Initially, risk was not a spelled-out concept, and early firms often had research and risk managed by the same individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:00">[26:22:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:40:00">[26:40:00]</a>. However, this model is now understood as needing separation for appropriate checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Managerial Mindset
> Growing from managing small personal funds to billions of dollars for others inherently leads to becoming more [[risk_management_in_trading | risk]] averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>. Managing pension fund money, people's savings, hopes, and dreams, along with supporting a large staff, shifts the mindset from purely entrepreneurial to one of deep responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:02:00">[42:02:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:11:00">[42:11:00]</a>.

> A key strategy is to surround oneself with talented people and foster teamwork, allowing the firm to maintain an entrepreneurial spirit while implementing thorough, process-driven [[risk_management_in_trading_strategies | risk management]] through capable teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:26:00">[42:26:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:11:00">[43:11:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>.

The role of systematic trading is considered core to a well-balanced portfolio, not due to the genius of individual traders, but due to the repeatability, robustness, thoroughness, and extensibility of the approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:38">[01:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>. The future of the industry points towards a "cult of robustness and reliability and evolutionary improvement," moving away from a "cult of personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:18">[01:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:18">[01:17:18]</a>.

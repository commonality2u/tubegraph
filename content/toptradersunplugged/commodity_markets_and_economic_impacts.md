Simon Hunt, a veteran expert with extensive experience in Central Africa's copper industry and significant time spent in Asia, particularly China, offers a contrarian global macro outlook focusing on the interplay of geopolitical events, financial leverage, and long-term cycles, particularly as they relate to commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:34">[03:22:34]</a>.

## Simon Hunt's Analytical Process
Hunt's analytical process is multifaceted. He has monitored rising debt levels since the 1970s, making debt central to his thinking, along with the actions of central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:27">[07:39:27]</a>. He gathers information from a global network of contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:32">[07:54:32]</a>. For timing and the extent of turning points, he collaborates closely with his technical associate at Wave Track International <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:22">[08:18:22]</a>.

A key element of his analysis is the study of cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:46">[09:19:46]</a>. He considers the long-term Kondratiev cycle, alongside shorter business cycles, noting that many are now converging, which is expected to lead to significant shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a>.

## Global Macro Outlook: War, Debt, and Inflation
Hunt anticipates a dangerous intensification of the war in Europe, which he views as a proxy conflict between Russia and NATO, with a risk of it becoming an outright war by the end of 2022 and spreading beyond Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:58">[14:13:58]</a>. This intensification coincides with a highly leveraged global financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:05">[14:58:05]</a>.

He predicts that central banks, currently tightening credit and raising interest rates, will be forced to reverse course and add liquidity within the next three months to prevent widespread implosions in the global credit system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>. This pivot is expected to cause the dollar to come off its perch and lead to a resurgence of inflation, accompanied by significant increases in energy and food prices over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:19">[16:14:19]</a>.

### Geopolitical Hotspots
Beyond Europe, Hunt highlights Asia, specifically Taiwan, as a potential "hot spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:29:10">[21:29:10]</a>. He believes China does not wish to invade or blockade Taiwan but could be forced to act if America crosses a "red line," such as supporting a Taiwanese independence referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:28">[21:38:28]</a>. He notes that such an action would likely impact America more than China due to Taiwan's role in the semiconductor supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:59:17">[24:59:17]</a>. He also suggests keeping an eye on Syria and its potential expansion into Iran, which could create [[volatility_in_commodity_markets | volatile periods for oil prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:07">[27:31:07]</a>.

### Demographic Impact on China
China's demographics pose a significant challenge: in 1990, there were 14 employed people for every retiree, but by 2040, this is projected to fall to just four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:03">[24:01:03]</a>. This demographic shift is a primary reason for the Chinese leadership's focus on technology, productivity, and robotics to boost output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:49">[24:21:49]</a>.

### Financial System and Interest Rates
Hunt forecasts the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield to exceed 11% by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:05">[19:06:05]</a>. He states that while the Fed can control the short end of the curve, the market is much larger than the central bank and will drive the long end higher due to rising inflation and a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:00">[28:58:00]</a>. He expects US CPI to surpass the 1980 figure of 13.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:30">[29:15:30]</a>.

The combination of ongoing war, a highly leveraged financial system, and surging interest rates is expected to lead to a depression akin to 1929-1932 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:53">[19:34:53]</a>.

### Equity Markets
Hunt believes that equity markets are currently in a bear market rally, which will likely peter out before the end of 2022, leading to significant falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:21">[30:31:21]</a>. He projects the S&P 500 to drop below 3,000 in Q1 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:06:21">[31:06:21]</a>. However, from spring 2023 to mid/end 2024, he foresees a "last hurrah" in equity markets with parabolic rises to new all-time highs, followed by a crash as the world enters a depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:23">[33:00:23]</a>.

## [[Commodity Markets and Economic Impacts | Commodity Market Forecasts]]
Hunt distinguishes between a [[commodity_super_cycles | commodity super cycle]] and a normal business cycle, stating that the current environment is a normal business cycle, not a super cycle, especially with the world heading towards severe economic distress within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:40:24">[35:40:24]</a>.

### Energy
He forecasts the average oil price to be $107 in 2022, rising to $130 in 2023, and $170 in 2024, driven by inflationary pressures and supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:09:47">[37:09:47]</a>.

### Food Prices
Food prices are expected to explode upwards due to:
*   Denial of fertilizer and grain exports from Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:18">[16:46:18]</a>.
*   [[Structural Changes in Commodity Markets | Climate cycles]]: A cooling weather cycle (discussed below) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:19">[12:58:19]</a>.
*   The 90-year Glesberg cycle (a drought cycle) hitting around 2025, which caused the Dust Bowl in the 1930s in the agriculturally important U.S. Midwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:35">[17:39:35]</a>.
*   The FAO food price index, which averaged 95 in 2019 and 147 year-to-date 2022, is projected to reach 185 in 2024 and 220 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:06">[18:20:06]</a>.

[!INFO] Implications of high food prices
Such extreme increases in food prices will have a devastating impact on households globally, leading to soaring poverty in many parts of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:27">[18:51:27]</a>.

### Metals (Copper)
Copper is expected to experience a short-term bear market rally, reaching around $8,700 before the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:16">[37:52:16]</a>. Subsequently, in Q1 2023, prices could fall to $6,000 in line with equity market declines and weak physical consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:05:44">[38:05:44]</a>. However, a significant rebound is anticipated, driven by inflation, a falling dollar, consumption recovery, inventory replenishment by manufacturers, and financial institutions seeking a hedge. This could push copper to a peak of around $14,000 before the end of 2024, after which prices are expected to collapse as the depression sets in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:07:44">[39:07:44]</a>.

### Gold
Gold is seen as reflecting the "real value of everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:13">[39:36:13]</a>. With a resurgence in inflation, gold will be bought and held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:50:47">[39:50:47]</a>. Hunt suggests that a large part of the world will revert to a de facto gold standard, with commodities being valued in grams of gold rather than dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:12">[40:04:12]</a>. He expects gold prices to be significantly higher than today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:19:22">[40:19:22]</a>, noting that while gold might have fallen in dollar terms, it has risen in Yen, Euro, or Pound Sterling terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:36">[41:00:36]</a>.

## Currency Dynamics
The dollar is expected to fall sharply, with the Dollar Index potentially halving in value by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:41:07">[31:41:07]</a>. This decline may coincide with oil producers in the Gulf no longer selling oil for dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:01:42">[32:01:42]</a>. Hunt also anticipates the appearance of a new currency, composed by BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) with SEO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) and EAEU (Eurasian Economic Union), which will be based on the value of 20 commodities, but valued in grams of gold, not dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:11:58">[32:11:58]</a>.

He predicts significant rises in the Euro, Pound Sterling, Ruble, and Chinese Yuan by mid-2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:27:54">[42:27:54]</a>. The UAE Dirham is another currency to watch, as it might be delinked from the US dollar and coincide with oil sales in other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:48:38">[42:48:38]</a>.

## Long-Term Climate Cycles and [[Impact of decarbonization on commodities | Decarbonization]]
Climate operates in long-term cycles of 40 to 70 years, driven by sunspot activity, volcanic activity, and changes in ocean temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:19">[10:30:19]</a>. Hunt states that the world is moving out of a 40-year warming cycle into a 40-70 year cooling cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:47">[10:56:47]</a>. This cooling allows oceans to absorb excess CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. NOAA and NASA had a blog post (later withdrawn) in September 2020 stating that a cooling cycle would begin as soon as 2027, transitioning into a "full-blown cold cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:26">[11:24:26]</a>.

This shift raises questions about the continued push for EVs and renewables, as the weather cools under natural circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:58">[11:59:58]</a>. He notes a current pullback in Germany regarding EVs due to high electricity costs relative to petrol/diesel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:28:18">[36:28:18]</a>.

## Investment Considerations
Hunt emphasizes that he is a strategist, not a financial advisor. His approach is to continuously "watch the dots" to determine if his forecasts remain on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:54:19">[44:54:19]</a>. He only changes his view if the underlying data changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:21">[45:01:21]</a>.

His primary concerns are the dangerous financial state of the world and ongoing warmongering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29:10">[45:29:10]</a>. He is also concerned about certain groups attempting to reshape the world, believing they may have influenced governments but "have not bought the people," who are beginning to rebel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:43:24">[45:43:24]</a>.

Systematic Alpha Management (SAM), co-founded by Peter Campbell and Alexei Chekhov, has designed its trading strategies to navigate various market conditions, particularly focusing on **market neutral** approaches to generate returns independent of broad market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The firm's genesis in 2000, following the dot-com bubble burst and Nasdaq collapse, emphasized the need for strategies that could perform well in any market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Core Strategy: Market Neutral Spread Trading
SAM's original program is a [[trading_market_analysis_and_trends | market neutral]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This strategy applies concepts from long/short equity, statistical arbitrage, and spread trading to major global equity indices and currency futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The fundamental idea is to go long and short highly related markets, anticipating a reversal to a mean or spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The strategy relies on the fact that global equity indices, despite high daily correlation, can temporarily diverge intraday due to differing time zones and liquidity profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:34">[00:50:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>. These divergences are often liquidity-driven "misprices" rather than fundamental shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>.

### Sensitivity to [[Volatility in trading strategies | Market Volatility]]
The strategy's performance is significantly influenced by [[Market volatility and volatility strategies | market volatility]].
*   **Elevated Volatility:** Periods of high volatility, such as during the 2008 financial crisis, are generally beneficial for the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. In these conditions, divergences tend to be larger and occur more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>. When volatility is high, traders may make less rational decisions due to time pressure and tend to overbuy or oversell, creating opportunities for spread traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:44">[00:51:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>.
*   **Low Volatility:** Conversely, extremely low volatility, such as seen in late 2013-early 2014, poses challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. In such environments, "people are not afraid," leading to fewer "little mistakes" and making it more difficult for systemic strategies to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:29">[00:51:29]</a>. Historically, periods of extremely low volatility have often preceded market crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Relative Volatility:** While SAM is not outright long volatility, its strategies are sensitive to differences in volatility between major indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:45">[00:32:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>. For example, the 2011 drawdown was due to significantly higher [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] in European equity indices compared to US markets, stemming from the European debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>.
*   **Market Fragmentation:** A world with more fragmented and less coordinated economic cycles, particularly concerning differing approaches to solving crises, can impact spread strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

## Strategy Adaptability and Robustness
The core concept of SAM's strategy, exploiting time zone differences and intraday mispricings, is described as persistent and unlikely to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:44">[00:49:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>. The firm continuously adjusts its models to the ever-changing market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>. This includes:
*   **Dynamic Adjustments:** Models are adjusted quickly to new regimes, for example, by using a short 30-day look-back window for calculating hedge ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. This ensures that rapid changes in market conditions are reflected in their hedge ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:39">[00:33:39]</a>.
*   **Model Optimization:** Regular re-testing and re-optimization of parameters are crucial, especially for short-term trading where the timing of entry and exit is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:22">[00:53:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. Adjustments include determining when to trade, how to hedge (number of contracts for long/short positions), and which markets to cover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:55">[00:53:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.
*   **Post-2011 Adjustments:** Following a difficult year in 2011, SAM made important modifications to its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:55">[00:41:55]</a>. These adjustments were a primary reason for strong returns in 2012, even though the market environment was similar to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>. These changes included stopping trading certain European markets and adding new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>.

### Diversification through Multi-Strategy Program
In 2011, SAM introduced a second program, the Systematic Alpha Multi-Strategy fund, to enhance diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. This program allocates 50% to the original spread trading program and 50% to directional models, which include short-term [[correlation_between_trend_following_and_market_conditions | trend following]] or momentum models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The intention is to combine two return streams that are not only uncorrelated but can also have negative correlation during times of stress for the spread component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:59">[00:34:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>. This aims to reduce the likelihood of large drawdowns, though it might increase correlation to CTAs and introduce some beta exposure to markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

## Impact of Market Conditions on Strategy Performance
*   **Directional Indifference:** The market neutral futures program has a correlation to equity markets close to zero, meaning it does not rely on markets going up or down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. This characteristic provides portfolio diversification, offering positive returns when other managers might be struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:58">[00:47:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>.
*   **[[Effects of market uncertainty on trading behavior | Market Efficiency and Arbitrage]]:** The effectiveness of the core strategy hinges on the persistence of time zone differences and the resultant intraday mispricings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. The "arbitrage" opportunity remains viable as long as billions of dollars do not flow into this market segment to arbitrage it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:24">[00:55:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:28">[00:55:28]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Nature:** The average holding period for trades is about one day or 8 to 10 trading hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Beyond one day, the predictive power of the models decreases, as longer divergences are more likely due to fundamental reasons rather than liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:07">[00:59:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:17">[00:59:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:45">[00:59:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. This requires prompt exits for losing trades through hard stops or small reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:21">[00:58:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:30">[00:58:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:36">[00:58:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:47">[00:58:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>.
*   **[[Global macroeconomic influences on trading strategies | Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Impacts]]:** The 2011 European debt crisis significantly impacted SAM's performance, leading to high [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] and divergence between European and US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. This highlights that while market neutral strategies aim for independence from broad market direction, they are not immune to profound shifts in relative market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>.

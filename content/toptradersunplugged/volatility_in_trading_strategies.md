Top Traders Unplugged is a platform designed to help individuals learn from hedge fund managers to enhance their due diligence and investment careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This article explores insights from Nichol Kagan, founder and CIO of Quest Partners, regarding [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] and its role in investment strategies, drawing from his personal experiences and professional observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Nichol Kagan's Background and Approach

Nichol Kagan's childhood experiences, including living through wars and uncertainty in Lebanon before moving to the U.S. at age 16, influenced his approach to life and the design of his [[Volatility and trend following in markets | trading strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. He emphasizes a philosophy of looking at the world with clarity to build solution-oriented alternative investment firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

Kagan's journey into finance began with an electrical engineering background, leading to consulting work at Solomon Brothers where he applied programming and modeling for mortgage-backed securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. He started designing models in 1991, initially focusing on [[Volatility and strategies in 2022 | volatility breakout models]] for short-term day trading (3-4 day holding periods) before developing [[Volatility and trend following in markets | trend following models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. His early inspiration came from Investors Business Daily, which provided tools for evaluating stocks using technical and fundamental measuring techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## The CTA Industry and Factor Drifts

Kagan highlights that the CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) industry, often perceived as skill-based, can largely be replicated today with simple models like a 10-day to 100-day simple moving average crossover strategy, which achieves 70% correlation to the industry and outperforms due to lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. He argues that managers who have grown significantly have often gained exposure to "risk-on" strategies correlated to equity markets, leading to returns that are not necessarily skill-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

Kagan identifies seven key "factor drifts" that have affected CTA returns, which investors should be aware of to discern true skill from factor exposure:

1.  **Sector Optimization**: CTAs have increasingly allocated to fixed income due to its strong performance and liquidity over the last 20 years. This can improve the Sharpe ratio by 40% but means performance is often tied to fixed income's negative correlation with stocks during equity corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.
2.  **Long vs. Short Exposure**: Over 90% of returns from basic CTA strategies come from the long side, with short trades contributing very little. Focusing on longs can improve the Sharpe ratio by 80%, implicitly pushing larger CTAs towards a long-biased position due to transaction costs and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
3.  **Time Frame Extension**: CTAs have shifted to longer time frames (e.g., 10-day to 500-day moving averages), with average trades lasting 100-150 days. This longer-term approach, while seemingly robust, can improve the Sharpe ratio by 70% without necessarily involving skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.
4.  **Mean Reversion and Buying the Dips**: While CTAs typically benefit from trends, the value-added aspect comes from generating returns when [[Volatility and strategies in 2022 | volatility is expanding]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. However, many managers now reduce position size when volatility expands within a trend and add to positions when it compresses (buying dips and selling rallies). This "mean reversion" strategy, common in financial markets influenced by central bank liquidity, improves Sharpe ratios but erodes positive skew, making them less capable of benefiting from [[Volatility and strategies in 2022 | volatility expansions]] during equity corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>. A simple model of buying the S&P if it's down three days in a row has a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 over the last 15 years, significantly improving the typical [[Volatility and trend following in markets | trend following model's Sharpe ratio]] by 130% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
5.  **Fixed Long Equity Exposure**: The largest CTAs (the "BTop") show a 70% rolling correlation to the S&P 500 in their residual returns after removing the [[Volatility and trend following in markets | trend following component]]. Adding a fixed long position in the S&P 500 can improve Sharpe ratios by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.
6.  **Short VIX (Short Volatility)**: Shorting the VIX, which acts like being short puts, can improve the Sharpe ratio by 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
7.  **Carry Models and Credit Strategies**: Typical carry models can improve Sharpe ratios by 18%, and exposure to credit strategies (e.g., credit swaps) by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>.

Kagan argues that these seven factors are not skill-based but are highly correlated to the largest CTAs, steadily increasing their correlation over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Crucially, all these factors reduce CTAs' ability to hedge equity corrections, converting positive skew into negative skew for numerically higher Sharpe ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:56">[00:36:56]</a>. He concludes that investors frequently misinterpret numerical Alpha as skill, whereas it often results from taking on more tail risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.

## Quest Partners' Distinct Approach to Volatility

Quest Partners' original program has maintained a consistent philosophy since its inception in May 1999: to be a [[Volatility and trend following in markets | trend follower]] correlated to CTA indices, but also to generate significant Alpha (around 7% annually to the BTop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. Their Alpha specifically comes from positively skewed sources of returns, meaning they avoid bottom-picking equities, increased fixed income allocation, going long equities, shorting VIX, carry trades, or credit spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>.

### Volatility as the Primary Driver
For Quest Partners, [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] is the most important criterion behind their trade setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. They prioritize understanding the character of [[Volatility and market mechanics | volatility]] over pure price trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:28">[00:57:28]</a>.

### Emphasis on Positively Skewed Alpha and Short-Term Time Frames
The firm disqualifies research ideas that lead to negatively skewed alpha, which often involves mean reversion or exposure to "risk-on" trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>. Positively skewed sources of Alpha are considered more stable when [[Market volatility and volatility strategies | market regimes change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

Quest Partners focuses on shorter time frames, with an average of about 7 days per trade for their original program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. This is because significant [[Volatility and strategies in 2022 | volatility expansion]] (tail events) and positive skew are most pronounced in these shorter periods, unlike longer-term strategies adopted by larger CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>.

### Measuring Volatility and Exploiting Market Imbalances
Quest Partners actively seeks [[Volatility and strategies in 2022 | volatility expansion]] in environments where [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]] has previously compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>. Their approach involves a more complex measurement of [[Volatility and market mechanics | volatility]], considering how it behaves at new market highs and lows versus in the middle of a trading range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:45">[00:56:45]</a>. This acknowledges that entities like central banks and option sellers can influence [[Volatility and market mechanics | volatility]] by intervening to minimize costs and create dramatic reversals at price extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

They believe markets have "memory," exhibiting periods of positive serial correlation (trends) followed by negative serial correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Their strategy aims to identify imbalances in volatility patterns. For example, if a market goes up without much noise (low [[Volatility in financial markets | volatility]]), a sharper correction is expected than if it goes up with noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. Significant differentials in different aspects of [[Volatility and market mechanics | volatility]] are seen as indicators of future market rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### Model Construction and Automation
Quest Partners runs about five core concepts applied across two or more time frames, all based on the same underlying principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. These concepts include market skew, [[Volatility and strategies in 2022 | volatility compression]], and [[Volatility and market mechanics | volatility]] at extremes versus the middle of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. All models are applied to all markets in their portfolio, as Kagan believes not doing so is a form of over-optimization within the CTA space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:27">[01:06:27]</a>.

Their models are primarily based on stops rather than channel breakouts, using specific entry conditions that differ from standard channel breakouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. A critical component is the use of time stops, where trades are exited after a certain period if the Alpha is no longer present, even in [[Volatility and trend following in markets | trend following models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>. This ensures they maximize Alpha per unit of Beta, exiting when other CTAs are likely to catch up and the trade becomes more "beta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:15">[01:04:15]</a>.

The firm's operational structure leverages automation, particularly in order management, order execution, and trading strategies, which are kept in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Back-office and administrative functions are outsourced as a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Kagan stresses that a small team can manage multiple strategies effectively if there is clarity of direction and purpose, avoiding over-optimization that would require excessive mental maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. They believe the human mind is not equipped to make ideal decisions in financial markets due to biases towards crowd thinking and immediate gratification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>. Therefore, they rely on models once they are programmed and trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

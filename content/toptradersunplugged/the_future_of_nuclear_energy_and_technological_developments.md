The political landscape is changing regarding [[the_future_of_nuclear_power | nuclear power]], particularly in Europe, the U.S., and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. Nuclear energy is seen as a crucial solution because it is both more efficient than current energy sources and emits no CO2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>. It is considered "off the efficient Frontier" due to its high efficiency, being three times more efficient than oil and gas, unlike renewables which are only one-sixth as efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Challenges with Current Nuclear Reactors

Third-generation nuclear reactors, which are large, 1.2 gigawatt facilities, face several challenges:
*   **High Cost**: They are expensive to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. An example is the South Carolina plant which faced massive cost blowouts and led to sponsor bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.
*   **Waste Generation**: They create nuclear waste, though this is now acknowledged as less of an issue than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Perceived Safety**: Despite public perception, nuclear reactors are extremely safe, with only three significant incidents in 60 years globally (Fukushima, Three Mile Island, and Chernobyl) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Chernobyl was primarily a clandestine weapons facility, not a typical power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>. The Fukushima incident resulted in no fatalities, challenging the perceived danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>.
*   **Design Complexity**: These reactors operate by heating water with a nuclear core to about 500 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. To prevent the water from boiling away immediately and causing a core meltdown, it must be kept under high pressure, requiring active pumping and very thick, high-specification materials like steel and cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Welding issues in these complex structures have contributed to cost overruns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

## Innovations in Nuclear Technology

The new fourth-generation or Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are offering fundamentally different approaches:

### Small Modular Reactors (AP1000 derivatives)
Some SMRs are essentially scaled-down versions of existing AP1000 reactors, producing around 300 megawatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.
*   **Factory Production**: Their main advantage is the ability to be factory-built, leading to potential cost reductions through mass production and "muscle memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>.
*   **Material Use**: However, the amount of material required per unit of electricity (e.g., steel per megawatt-hour) remains the same as larger, third-generation reactors, suggesting limited overall cost reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>. Companies like NuScale focus on this approach, emphasizing proven technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.

### Molten Salt Reactors
Companies like TerraPower, backed by Bill Gates and in a joint venture with Berkshire-owned utility PacificCorp, are developing reactors that use molten salt instead of water to cool the nuclear core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.
*   **Operation**: Salt is heated to about 300 degrees Celsius, at which point it melts into a clear, very hot liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>. This molten salt boils at a much higher temperature (700-800 degrees Celsius) than water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **"Walk-Away Safe"**: This design is inherently safer, described as "walk-away safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:27">[00:43:27]</a>. If electricity is lost, the molten salt can continue to cool the reactor without boiling or risking meltdown of the containment vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.
*   **Reduced Material Costs**: Without the need to deal with high-pressure steam, the requirements for thick steel, cement, and other materials significantly decrease, potentially reducing the bill of materials by 75% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. This leads to smaller plants and lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Molten salt reactors are not new; the U.S. has operated them in laboratory settings since the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:48">[00:44:48]</a>. The nuclear industry's slowness to change due to high safety standards meant it stuck with the high-pressure water reactor design favored by Admiral Rickover of the U.S. Navy for submarine applications, as molten salt reacts dangerously with water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a>.

These new technologies hold significant promise for making nuclear energy a more viable and cost-effective solution for [[current_and_future_societal_changes | future energy demands]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:39">[00:44:39]</a>. However, the path to commercialization is lengthy, with demonstration plants expected by the end of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>.

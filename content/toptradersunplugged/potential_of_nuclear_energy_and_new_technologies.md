The world is currently experiencing an energy crisis, with insufficient energy supply [00:00:06]. Despite this, there's a push away from traditional oil and gas towards [[challenges_of_renewable_energy | renewables]], which some argue will worsen the problem [00:00:13]. The immediate need is for efficient energy sources to overcome the current "hump" [00:00:20].

## Nuclear Power as a Key Solution

One major solution for the energy crisis and carbon emission reduction is [[the_future_of_nuclear_power | nuclear power]] [00:53:01]. It is considered "extremely energy efficient" [00:53:03] and directly addresses carbon needs [00:53:05].

In contrast, windmills and solar panels, while aiming for a green world, require significant energy to produce the energy itself [00:53:12]. This energy return on energy invested (EROEI) for wind and solar is considerably lower (around 10 to 1 over a 20-year life) compared to oil and gas (about 30 to 1, with energy front-loaded in the first five years) [00:56:00]. Germany and South Africa, despite doubling or significantly increasing their electricity generating base, still experience huge blackouts, suggesting a fundamental issue with their chosen energy paths [00:53:36].

The speaker emphasizes that without nuclear energy, societies would either need to dramatically lower their standard of living (which is opposed as unethical and unrealistic) or continue emitting CO2 [01:01:32].

## Challenges and Shifting Sentiment

Historically, three main issues have plagued [[the_future_of_nuclear_power | nuclear power]]:
1.  **Cost:** Nuclear power costs have escalated astronomically, making it difficult for most countries (except China and Korea) to build new third-generation light water reactors [01:02:03]. Many nuclear engineering businesses have been dismantled over the last decade [01:02:22].
2.  **Perceived Safety:** There's a public perception of safety issues, fearing meltdowns and radioactive material release [01:03:05]. However, the nuclear industry's track record is "unbelievably safe," with significantly fewer deaths per megawatt hour compared to coal mining accidents [01:02:36].
3.  **Waste:** Concerns exist about what to do with nuclear waste, both from a proliferation standpoint (making bombs) and storage [01:03:15]. While France and the United States have workable solutions for waste [01:03:22], these concerns persist.

Public sentiment is, however, clearly shifting towards [[the_future_of_nuclear_power | nuclear energy]] [01:00:33]. The European Union has included nuclear in its green taxonomy [01:00:13]. Countries like France, the UK, the Netherlands, and even Japan are embarking on new nuclear build-outs or extending existing plants [01:00:24].

## [[the_future_of_nuclear_energy_and_technological_developments | New Nuclear Technologies]]: Gen 4 and SMRs

While traditional nuclear plants have long lead times (not a quick fix for immediate crises) [01:01:09], new fourth-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are seen as a potential solution to address the historical challenges [01:00:48].

These new designs aim to tackle all three major issues:
*   **Cost:** They are projected to come in "well below current generation nuclear" in terms of cost [01:04:20].
*   **Safety:** Designs are being pursued that make it impossible to melt down the reactor [01:04:07].
*   **Waste:** Some new technologies could "reduce the amount of waste by an order of magnitude or more" [01:04:16].

A notable example of a company advancing these technologies is TerraPower, based in Washington state and financed by Bill Gates [01:03:54]. Their reactor designs are considered "really exciting" and address the cost, safety, and waste issues head-on [01:04:03]. Although these innovations are currently primarily happening within private companies, there's optimism about their future impact [01:04:31].

## The Challenge of Human Discretion in Trading

While there are few circumstances where meddling with or overriding a trading system is appropriate, the significant danger lies in spending too much time observing a system's actions and following financial news, as these activities can lead to second-guessing and overriding the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is why some choose not to monitor their trades constantly but rather focus on setting up a fully automated system that reports only when issues might arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

In many cases, the accuracy of human experts is matched or even surpassed by simple algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. According to Daniel Kahneman's book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, experts often try to be clever, think outside the box, and consider complex feature combinations when making predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While complexity might work in isolated instances, it more frequently reduces validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Why Systematic Trading?

Many individuals are not as proficient at trading as they believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Human brains are wired in ways that can lead to emotional biases when making decisions based on complex information, often resulting in poor choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. A common bias is overconfidence, where people believe they are much better than average at trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

[[systematic_trading_systems | Systematic trading systems]] provide a solution by removing emotion and facilitating adherence to a consistent strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. By utilizing a system with relatively simple rules, individuals can overcome these inherent biases and even exploit the biases of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

### Types of Investors and Systematic Approaches

In [[systematic_and_discretionary_trading_approaches | systematic and discretionary trading approaches]], three types of investors are identified:

*   **Staunch Systems Trader:** This individual follows an end-to-end process with completely [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Their rules are fully systemic, from initial trading rules to position management, risk management, and execution, with no deviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. Such systems can be fully automated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **Semi-Automatic Trader:** This type of trader maintains the freedom to make personal market forecasts (e.g., "Apple is a good buy") but then integrates these qualitative opinions into a [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading system]] for position management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. The system determines position size, stop levels, entry/exit points, and holistic risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. A robust position management framework can even yield profits with completely random entries, as it naturally tends to pick up on market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.
*   **Asset Allocating Investor:** This individual takes a long-term buy-and-hold approach, believing that forecasting market prices is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. They typically invest in a diversified selection of ETFs across different asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Even for this approach, a position management framework is valuable for accounting for differing asset risks, correlations, and managing portfolio rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>.

### The Importance of Adherence

A core principle of [[systematic_vs_discretionary_trading | systematic vs discretionary trading]] is the adherence to a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. The benefits of a [[systematic_trading_systems | system]] are lost if one meddles with it or makes changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This applies to both retail traders who second-guess signals from charting packages and large institutions that debate overriding system risks due to market events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>.

Since a purely [[systematic_trading_systems | systematic trading system]] is tested on historical data where no human interference occurred, comfort with its backtested behavior should translate to comfort in letting it run without interference in live trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. While there are very few circumstances where overriding a system is justified, the danger of doing so increases when spending too much time monitoring the system and financial news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>. This is particularly challenging in institutional settings due to fiduciary duties and the pressure to react to unexpected events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.

As Cliff Asness noted, success in investment comes from "doing something reasonable that makes sense and then sticking to it with incredibly fortitude through the tough times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:33">[00:48:33]</a>. The ability to stick to a plan with discipline over the long run is often more crucial than sheer genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>.

## Objective vs. Subjective Systems

A key distinction in [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysis versus systematic trading]] lies in objectivity. Traditional [[technical_analysis_versus_systematic_trading | technical analysis]], which involves pattern matching (e.g., double bottoms, head and shoulders, golden crosses), is often highly subjective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a>. These patterns are often in the "eye of the beholder," and it's generally difficult to write algorithms that can consistently identify and profit from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

To truly trade [[systematic_trading_systems | systematically]], an objective method is required to identify positions based on data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. This can involve rules based on moving average crossovers or breakouts from a range, provided the range itself is objectively defined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

Advantages of objective systems:
*   **Backtestability:** Assuming the future will somewhat resemble the past, objective systems can be backtested, allowing for validation and confidence in their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.
*   **Repeatability:** They are predictable and consistent in their execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
*   **Analyzable Properties:** Their risk properties, leverage, and trading speed can be analyzed and incorporated into the system design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a>.

A [[systematic_trading_systems | system]] that is fully automated but not completely trusted is potentially lethal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. Trust in a system is built on understanding its behavior and simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>. Simple systems are easier to monitor for unexpected behavior, allowing for investigation when anomalies occur, ensuring they operate as expected most of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:06">[00:55:06]</a>.

## Pitfalls to Avoid in Systematic Trading

When creating [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]], three common pitfalls to avoid are:

1.  **Overfitting (Curve Fitting):** This occurs when a trading system is excessively optimized to perform well on historical data, leading to unrealistic expectations for future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>.
    *   **Explicit Overfitting:** Involves automatically varying parameters to find the best-performing combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>.
    *   **Implicit Overfitting:** Less formal, it involves making changes to a system based on reviewing backtest results (e.g., choosing which assets to trade based on past performance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>.
    *   **Tacit Overfitting:** Occurs when only strategies already known to work are considered, even before any formal testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>. This is difficult to avoid as prior knowledge influences initial research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>.
    Overfitting is often driven by a desire for high backtest performance and overconfidence in one's ability to achieve exceptional returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:53">[00:57:53]</a>.
2.  **Overtrading:** This refers to trading too frequently, leading to performance being significantly eroded by costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Many people underestimate the true cost of trading, beyond just commissions, including bid-ask spreads and execution costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. Trading costs are a relatively stable and controllable factor to monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. High-frequency day trading, especially with expensive instruments like spread bets or retail FX, can be unprofitable due to excessive costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:09">[01:02:09]</a>.
3.  **Overbetting:** This involves taking on excessive risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>. While institutional managers typically aim for an expected average annual standard deviation of returns (risk) around 15-25%, many trading systems proposed in books or online may show hundreds of percent, indicating five to ten times higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>. Such high risk levels are often only justified by unrealistic expectations of returns, stemming from overconfidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:45">[01:03:45]</a>.

## Developing Trading Rules: Ideas First vs. Data First

There are two primary approaches to developing trading rules:
*   **Data First:** This approach typically involves using machine learning algorithms to process large datasets and automatically generate trading rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:33">[01:05:33]</a>. While potentially powerful, it carries a higher risk of misuse and overfitting if not carefully managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:38">[01:06:38]</a>.
*   **Ideas First:** This approach begins with an economic or behavioral idea about how the market works, and then a rule is created to express that idea and subsequently backtested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. This method provides an extra layer of validation by understanding the underlying rationale for profitability and potential risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. An example of an ideas-first approach would be understanding why a carry trade works due to a central bank's policy, as opposed to simply observing price patterns without understanding the fundamental drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. Profitable trading stems from "careful research done by thoughtful and knowledgeable people who seek to understand where profits come from" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>.

## System Adaptability and Market Change

The adaptability of a [[systematic_trading_systems | trading system]] to an ever-changing world depends on its trading speed:
*   **Fast-Trading Systems (High Frequency):** These systems, which trade very quickly, require frequent adaptation due to the constant changes in market microstructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. While a rule that worked a year ago might not work now, the abundance of data generated by fast trading allows for regular analysis and adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:26">[01:11:26]</a>.
*   **Slow-Trading Systems:** These systems typically aim to capture fundamental human behaviors that change very slowly, if at all, over hundreds of thousands of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:50">[01:11:50]</a>. Therefore, they generally do not require frequent changes and should utilize as much historical data as possible for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>. Attempting to adapt them annually to perceived new market conditions is often counterproductive due to insufficient data to confirm significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

### The Paradox of Trend Following

[[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | Systematic investing and trend following]] share a similar profit/loss distribution with lottery tickets: small, frequent losses interspersed with a few much larger wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. Despite this, people often enjoy playing the lottery but rarely express the same affection for [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic trading and trend following strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. This dichotomy arises from the size of the emotional "pain" experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:27">[01:15:27]</a>. While a small lottery ticket purchase is a minor loss, investing a significant portion of one's net worth in a [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trend following fund]] that experiences frequent drawdowns can lead to considerable emotional discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>. People generally prefer trading systems that consistently make money each month, even if they occasionally incur large losses, which is the opposite pattern of [[systematic_investing_and_trend_following | trend following]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:26">[01:14:26]</a>.

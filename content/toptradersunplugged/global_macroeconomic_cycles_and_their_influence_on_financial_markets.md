The world is currently experiencing a period where a significant monetary regime change is perceived to be imminent, with some experts placing it at "11:59" on a "Doomsday Clock" equivalent [00:00:09]. This suggests a potential catalyst in the near future, unlike anything seen in the past [00:00:23]. Discussions among top traders, including Adam Rosenke and Jim Kang, frequently revolve around [[global_macroeconomic_trends | global macroeconomic cycles]] and their profound impact on financial markets.

## A Framework for Understanding Global Macro

Adam Rosenke's framework for understanding current market dynamics centers on the significant bullish trend in natural resources and real assets [00:03:09]. Over the past six months, many factors have changed, strongly supporting this view [00:03:07].

Historically, natural resources and real assets have been undervalued for a long time relative to financial assets, with energy, for example, making up only 3% of the index compared to its long-term average of 15% [00:03:40]. While being early on such trades hasn't typically incurred significant costs due to extreme valuations, the timing is now becoming much clearer, making involvement crucial within the next six to nine months [00:04:09].

### Supply and Demand Dynamics in Commodities

A critical change in the commodity landscape is the emergence of supply responses following years of underinvestment and restricted exploration and development [00:04:29].
*   **Global Oil Markets**: The US has historically been the primary driver of global oil supply growth, meeting approximately nine-tenths of new demand with shale production over the last 15 years [00:04:49]. However, US shale growth has now turned negative year-on-year, with most shale regions (except the Permian) in sustained decline [00:04:57]. The Permian Basin is also showing signs of declining growth [00:05:16].
*   **Natural Gas**: US gas production, which had grown relentlessly since the mid-2000s due to shale gas fields, has also turned negative, declining by 2-3% year-on-year [00:05:43]. This shift is happening alongside massive new demand, making the fundamentals for both oil and natural gas look strong [00:06:07].
*   **Uranium**: Similar trends are observed in uranium, with production disappointments from Kazakhstan and Canada [00:06:33].

This broad trend across commodities stems from 15 years of a bear market and massive underinvestment, which inevitably leads to depletion and a subsequent supply response [00:06:56].

### The Influence of [[secular_and_cyclical_trends_in_global_macroeconomics | Macroeconomic Cycles]]

A long-term perspective reveals that the ratio of commodity prices to stock prices tells an interesting story dating back to 1900 [00:07:07]. Commodities and real assets move in vast cycles, offering opportunities to buy when cheap and sell when expensive [00:07:25]. The preconditions and catalysts for major bottoms in commodity cycles have been remarkably similar over the past 150 years [00:07:39].

These periods of radical real asset undervaluation are viewed as symptoms of a larger "carry regime cycle" [00:08:15]. This framework suggests that various factors align along the same timeline as these major commodity cycles, with significant bottoms occurring in 1929, 1969, 1999, and today [00:08:31]. This indicates a causal system at play, pointing towards a major reset in commodity prices and a huge bull market that could last 10 to 15 years [00:09:09].

### Technology's Role in Commodity Prices

While new technologies like Robert Friedland's pulsed power for mineral exploration and extraction are revolutionary, they haven't yet been implemented widely enough to impact current commodity prices, especially in hard rock mining [00:12:54].

However, in the oil and gas space, horizontal drilling and hydrofracking were disruptive technologies that unlocked massive shale deposits, contributing to a deflationary trend for a decade or more [00:13:48]. These shale fields, despite their immense scale, are now showing signs of depletion, with no similar-sized fields waiting to be exploited [00:16:17]. Therefore, while technology did contribute to lower prices in the past, it is no longer the primary driver of cheap commodity prices [00:16:56].

## Timing the Market Shift: The Monetary Regime Change

Historically, every major commodity and real asset market bottom and subsequent bull market has been triggered by a change in the monetary regime system [00:22:23].
*   **1920s-1930s**: The end of the gold standard was signaled by policies like quantitative easing by Benjamin Strong of the New York Fed, aiming to devalue the US dollar [00:22:50]. His controversial policies were undone after his death, leading to the 1929 stock market crash and the end of the gold standard [00:23:33].
*   **1968-1971**: The bottoming of commodities coincided with the end of the Bretton Woods system [00:23:55]. While Nixon is often blamed for taking the dollar off gold in 1971, the underlying change occurred in 1968 when President Johnson signed legislation removing the gold backing for the dollar [00:24:14].
*   **1999**: This period saw the fallout from LTCM (Long-Term Capital Management) and the Asian currency crisis [00:24:47]. Asian countries, impacted by hot money flight and lack of IMF/World Bank support, began pegging their currencies below market value to boost exports, leading to the "dollar recycling standard" [00:25:27]. This was a massive currency monetary regime change [00:25:45].

Today, a potential change in global monetary "plumbing" could originate from the United States itself [00:27:41]. Proposals from figures like Treasury Secretary Bessent, such as monetizing the Fed's balance sheet or revaluing Treasury gold holdings (currently held at $42 an ounce, a far cry from market price), suggest revolutionary changes [00:28:13]. The previous "dollar recycling standard," where US trade imbalances led to foreign central banks acquiring US treasuries, is likely over [00:28:51].

The current political landscape, with parallels drawn between the Trump and Nixon administrations, suggests a "burn it down" phase where disruptive figures make significant changes, often in the form of a monetary or fiscal reset [00:31:22].

The timing of such a shift is crucial. Given that the current administration has bold visions for operating policies, these changes would likely be implemented relatively early, potentially within the next six to nine months, or perhaps six to 18 months [00:30:36].

## The Carry Trade and Portfolio Vulnerability

The prevailing financial market environment is characterized by a "carry trade" regime, especially prominent over the last 15-20 years [00:34:15]. This is essentially a levered short-volatility trade, where investors pick up "pennies in front of the steamroller" as long as the market structure remains stable [00:34:47]. This regime has fueled the outperformance of growth over value, and momentum strategies, as suppressed volatility and low interest rates favor far-out cash flows and high-multiple stocks [00:35:15].

Historical parallels for this carry regime exist in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1990s [00:35:48]. During these periods, real assets tend to lose their appeal compared to abstract growth stocks [00:36:26]. The catalyst to undo such a carry trade is typically a "carry unwind" or a "volatility shock" that fundamentally alters the market system [00:36:57]. Monetary regime changes, like taking the US dollar off gold in 1971, are examples of such shocks that force a re-pricing of disparate asset classes [00:37:13].

A significant concern for many investors is that their diversified portfolios (e.g., US, Europe, emerging markets, private equity, hedge funds) are largely caught up in this pervasive carry trade [00:38:44]. Private equity, for instance, is often just a levered S&P return [00:38:52]. Therefore, if a carry unwind occurs, many portfolios may not be as diversified as believed, potentially leading to widespread losses [00:39:07]. Natural resources, on the other hand, are definitively *not* part of this carry trade basket and represent an anti-carry trade asset [00:39:28].

### Liquidity and Market Dislocation

The carry trade relies heavily on liquidity, which acts as its "fuel" [00:40:13]. As liquidity is currently reducing dramatically, the market's ability to sustain irrational valuations diminishes [00:40:46]. While the "plane can glide for a while" even with low fuel, a disruption or "storm" can cause significant turbulence and force a re-alignment with fundamental valuations [00:41:00].

Potential catalysts for this include:
1.  **Narrative Change**: A shift in market perception, perhaps under a new administration, where confidence in existing trends (like the energy trade) is lost [00:42:34]. This "loss of faith" could accelerate a move towards fundamental value [00:42:25].
2.  **Big Shock**: A major crisis, such as an [[opportunities_and_risks_in_global_macroeconomic_environments | Emerging Market crisis]], especially in a global slowdown [00:42:48]. Many Emerging Markets are already fragile even amidst a relatively stable global economy [00:43:05].

## [[Geopolitical and macroeconomic factors influencing markets | Commodities and Geopolitics]]

The idea of "weaponizing commodities" is not new, with historical examples like Japan's actions during World War II to secure energy supplies, or China's restriction of rare earth metals exports to Japan around 2010 for geopolitical leverage [00:48:27]. While a full-scale weaponization of commodities by the US is not yet evident, there is a renewed appreciation for supply security and the recognition of raw material supply lines as strategic vulnerabilities in an increasingly hostile world [00:51:03]. The US, for instance, is now working to re-establish domestic supplies of materials like antimony and uranium, which it previously relied on imports for [00:50:50].

## Specific Commodity Opportunities

While commodities generally move in cycles, specific opportunities exist due to market dislocations:

*   **US Natural Gas**: Currently the biggest dislocation, with US gas prices 80% below the world price [00:52:51]. This is due to massive shale supply in the past [00:52:58]. However, with electricity demand set to surge due to AI data centers and significant US LNG (Liquefied Natural Gas) exports coming online, alongside declining domestic production, this disparity could close rapidly, potentially leading to a three to fourfold increase in gas prices [00:53:21]. Europe, in particular, is in a precarious energy position, currently relying on relatively cheap US gas [01:14:28].
*   **Uranium**: The market is in a sharp deficit, as new capacity has not kept pace with demand [00:55:05]. Expectations of retiring nuclear plants did not materialize; instead, existing plants are getting life extensions and new builds are occurring in places like China and Korea [00:55:15]. Inventories are near zero, and term prices are rising [00:55:31]. While a new major mine (Rook I Arrow in Canada) is slated for 2027-2028, its timely delivery is uncertain [00:56:28]. Geopolitical risks, particularly involving Kazakhstan (a major producer), could also lead to significant supply disruptions [01:13:09].
*   **Gold**: Gold prices are reaching new all-time highs with almost no Western retail or institutional participation [00:57:08]. The primary buyers have been central banks [00:57:19]. Western investors are typically pro-cyclical and chase price, suggesting significant potential buying power if prices continue to rise [00:57:50]. Central banks are price agnostic and buy based on policy changes, adding further bullish sentiment [00:58:14].

### Gold vs. Bitcoin

Some argue that Bitcoin could reduce demand for gold, especially among younger generations who view it as a store of wealth [00:59:06]. However, fundamental differences exist:
*   **Supply**: Gold's long-term supply increase has historically mirrored real GDP growth, contributing to its stability as a store of value [01:00:22]. Bitcoin's supply is designed to asymptote, not grow in line with GDP, raising questions about its long-term suitability as a real store of value [01:01:40].
*   **Energy Consumption**: Bitcoin mining is a massive energy hog, which could become unsustainable if its value and usage continue to increase significantly [01:01:59].
*   **Carry Trade Asset**: Bitcoin has largely traded like a tech stock or a high-duration bond, suggesting it might be a carry trade asset [01:02:49]. Gold, by contrast, is an anti-carry trade asset [01:02:43]. The year 2022, which saw a "carry trade unwind," showed Bitcoin having a terrible year while gold performed well, indicating gold's potential as a hedge in a regime shift [01:03:34].

While conspiracy theories often surround gold holdings (e.g., about Fort Knox's reserves), they tend to reinforce its anonymous and myth-laden appeal, which contributes to its power [01:05:27].

### Oil Vulnerability

Despite the US being "energy independent," oil remains a significant vulnerability [01:11:20]. Similar to 1970, when US oil production unexpectedly declined, current US shale production growth has stopped after years of massive increases [01:09:33]. This could make the US susceptible to external supply shocks, akin to the OPEC crisis of the 1970s [01:10:00]. This vulnerability could force the US to re-evaluate its energy policies, potentially leading to curtailing exports if domestic needs (such as for AI data centers) are prioritized [01:15:38].

The current period is uncharted territory, with the potential for significant market disruptions and a monumental shift in how global financial systems operate.

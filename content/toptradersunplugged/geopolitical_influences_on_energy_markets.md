Jeff Currie, Head of Commodity Research at Goldman Sachs, discusses how [[impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_global_markets | geopolitical events]] and economic policies significantly shape commodity and energy markets, particularly highlighting the unique characteristics of the current environment compared to historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Current Market Distinctions

The current period is uniquely characterized by a strong focus on decarbonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This focus makes it challenging for the commodity sector to generate the typical supply response seen under high pricing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Publicly traded energy companies, for example, are incentivized to perform share buybacks with cash flow rather than investing in new oil drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

This trend is observable across all commodities, as the "old economy" (which includes these sectors) accounts for 80% of global emissions, leading investors to avoid it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The ability to attract capital into the commodity space has been severely constrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Currie advocates for a carbon price or tax to address decarbonization rationally, arguing that current investment distortions create higher prices than a carbon tax would, and governments are not collecting the associated revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Inflation and Income Dynamics

Commodity bull markets and inflation are primarily driven by low-income groups, not high-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This is because physical commodity markets are volumetric, driven by quantity consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. High-income groups control dollars, which influence financial markets, but cannot numerically create physical commodity inflation because there are not enough of them to control the vast volumes consumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. The only commodity high-income groups could hoard is gold due to its high density and storability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Current policies, such as Europe's windfall profit tax, exacerbate this issue by making the supply problem worse and accentuating demand by redistributing funds to lower-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Historically, commodity bull markets like China's growth in the 2000s and the 1970s commodity story were invariably driven by low-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Oil Market Dynamics

### Russia and Supply Disruptions
Following the December 5th price cap implementation, Russian oil flow has decreased by approximately 200,000-300,000 barrels per day due to frictions like difficulty finding refineries or suitable ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. A more significant problem is anticipated on the product side (gasoline, distillate) from February, as these products are less fungible than crude oil and require more complex logistics, potentially leading to a loss of another 600,000 barrels per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Russia will likely do everything to keep production flowing to prevent infrastructure damage from deep freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>.

### OPEC's Newfound Power
Only Saudi Arabia and UAE have reinvestment rates at or above 2019 levels, making them the primary engines of oil growth in a decarbonizing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:48">[00:31:48]</a>. Long-term investments in deepwater offshore platforms are no longer attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. The three primary engines of growth were fast-cycle production from the US shale, the Middle East, and Russia, but Russia is now constrained, and US shale faces capital attraction issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. This leaves the Middle East as the main engine of growth, giving core OPEC (Gulf countries) unprecedented market power due to the inelastic supply elasticity of other producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. OPEC has demonstrated high credibility by consistently hitting production targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>.

### Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR)
The sale of Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) ended in December 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. This loss of up to 1 million barrels per day of SPR supply, combined with a gain of over 1 million barrels per day of Chinese demand and a loss of up to 500,000-600,000 barrels per day of Russian supply, creates a significant shift in market balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>. It is unlikely the SPR will be used in 2023, possibly being held until 2024 for electoral purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.

## Natural Gas Market

Europe consumes approximately 45 billion cubic feet (BCF) per day of gas, with Russia previously supplying about 15 BCF (one-third) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>. Europe lost roughly 10 BCF of Russian gas but replaced about 4 BCF from LNG and 1 BCF from coal switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>. This still leaves a shortfall of 5 BCF, which was managed in late 2022 by bidding away LNG normally destined for China and favorable warm weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:36">[00:45:36]</a>.

The problem could resurface in late 2023 into 2024 if China's demand rebounds and Europe experiences a cold winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:51">[00:45:51]</a>. This gas problem is global, affecting everywhere except the U.S. east of the Rockies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

For long-term viability, Germany's manufacturing sector relies on Russian piped gas, as it cannot efficiently operate on LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. Moving BMW plants to US gas fields would be more logical than shipping liquefied gas globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>. Petrochemical capacity, historically located in Germany due to cheap Russian gas and strategic distance from Soviet targets, cannot operate efficiently on LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>. Some industrial activities like aluminum smelting and fertilizer production have already shifted from Europe to areas with cheaper gas, like the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.

## Metals and Geopolitics

Aluminum is predicted to be one of the most bullish commodities in the next 5-10 years, driven more by China's domestic policies than direct Russian supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>. This is due to the "climate paradox": aluminum production is highly emissive but crucial for solving climate change (it's a top six green metal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>. China has imposed export tariffs on aluminum, indicating a desire to keep energy for domestic use and curtail highly polluting smelters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>. Russia, by contrast, has cleaner (hydro-based) aluminum production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:19">[00:43:19]</a>.

For smaller, rare earth type metals like Titanium, Platinum, and Palladium, Russia holds significant market shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. If Russia sought to disrupt global growth, targeting these smaller markets where they have huge market share would be the most effective way to create problems for the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

## Agriculture and Geopolitics

Agricultural commodity prices are back to highs seen during the initial Russia-Ukraine conflict, driven by weather (e.g., Argentina drought), which underscores their tight market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

The structural bull market in agriculture is attributed to "the three Cs":
*   **Climate:** Yields in traditional breadbaskets (like the US or Brazil's Mato Grosso) are increasingly constrained by weather shocks, necessitating a shift towards more northern climates or regions with better yields, which takes time and creates supply restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.
*   **Conflict:** Conflicts, such as in Ukraine or parts of Africa, create serious issues for agricultural supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:20">[00:52:20]</a>.
*   **Carbon:** There is underinvestment in carbon-related assets, including food (a carbohydrate or carbon-hydrogen bond), mirroring the underinvestment dynamics seen in oil and metals and mining sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Investment

The current [[impact_of_esg_and_geopolitical_factors_on_natural_resource_markets | geopolitical and macroeconomic factors influencing markets]] suggest a commodity super cycle, requiring trillions of dollars in capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. The most asymmetric way to profit is by owning equities in the space, as they will be the primary conduit for this capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:18">[01:00:18]</a>. Additionally, holding a basket of commodities can serve as an inflation hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:25">[01:00:25]</a>.

Specific investment opportunities include:
*   **Uranium:** An excellent example of a commodity to own in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>.
*   **Metals and Miners:** Essential for enabling the "Green Revolution" by producing key metals for green capital expenditure (e.g., copper, aluminum, silver, nickel, lithium, cobalt) and rare earth metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>.

However, if forced to choose one, oil remains the most strategically important commodity. It drives macro variables, and consumption is not stopping. Without investment and with continued consumption, the gap between supply and demand will widen, creating significant future volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. This highlights the ongoing need for a carbon price or tax to manage consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:38">[01:01:38]</a>.

Welcome to Top Traders Unplugged, a platform for learning from leading hedge fund managers about [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment strategy]] and [[global_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | market analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is important to remember that all discussions about investment performance pertain to the past, and past performance does not guarantee future results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. All [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | investment strategies]] carry a significant risk of financial loss, and specific risks should be understood from the investment manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

This article features insights from Tushar Chande, co-founder and Head of Research at Row Asset Management, and author of several books on designing rule-based [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | trading systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Tushar Chande's Background

Tushar Chande's background is in engineering, specifically high-powered R&D with a PhD in engineering, which involved extensive mathematical modeling and simulations to understand underlying processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This background naturally led him to primarily use quantitative methods, aligning with a [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | systematic approach]] to problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

While his scientific work focused on cause-and-effect relationships, Chande found markets interesting because they are fundamentally random, without a clear cause-and-effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For the same inputs, equity market models can yield a wide range of outputs, making it challenging to predict outcomes efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Despite this randomness, he was intrigued by the possibility of finding rules to react to the market differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Chande has published numerous articles and authored books, including "Beyond Technical Analysis," which has been translated into many languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. His writings aim to communicate his understanding and models for the markets to a broader audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Row Asset Management's Algos Program

The Row Asset Management's Algos program began in November 2007 and manages approximately $40 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. It is primarily a medium-term [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### Program Philosophy and Design

The Algos program aims to incorporate behaviors of discretionary traders into a single [[systematic_trading_and_trend_following_strategies | program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Unlike hiring specialized traders for different markets (e.g., bond, energy, currency), the program applies the *same rules* across all markets to ensure robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While human traders can adjust position size based on conviction from external information (e.g., a new prime minister's mandate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, the Algos program incorporates rule-based algorithms to change position size without explicitly factoring in specific news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Organizational Structure

Row Asset Management is based in Zurich, Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. From its inception, the firm has leveraged a high level of automation for daily trading, reconciliation, back office, and record-keeping processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Repetitive aspects of the business are automated for control, consistency, and disciplined execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Key functions kept in-house include research, trading, software development, and client relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Functions like administration, accounting, and legal/compliance are partly outsourced to gain third-party assessment, efficiency, and an arms-length perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Optimal Capacity

The Algos strategy's capacity is estimated to be well in excess of a billion US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. At that point, Row Asset Management may need to add more systems or adjust execution methods to control slippage and maintain profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Historical Performance and Market Environment

The Algos fund's performance has differed between the periods before and after 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. While it has generally performed as designed, the macro environment significantly impacts outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>
> "If you are a fan of Formula 1, you know that the cars are very highly optimized for each circuit, but the circuit is a static object. We pretty much know where all the turns are going to be. Now, if it rains during the race day, the performance of the F1 cars falls off dramatically. Why is that? Because even the best drivers need optimal conditions to perform at the world class level."

Similarly, market conditions, particularly after the 2008 Lehman Brothers crisis, became unusually difficult for [[trend_following_and_market_cycles | CTAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Before 2007-2008, markets typically had periods of weak performance followed by strong trends, allowing for recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. After 2008/2009, most trends were limited to equity and bond markets, benefiting managers heavily exposed to those sectors with slow-moving systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

The Algos program, being a highly diversified trader without overweighting any specific sector, faced a challenging environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The firm uses a "Road Trend Barometer" to measure the percentage of markets that are trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. A break-even level is around 42.5% to 45% of markets trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. When only 20% of markets trend, [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend followers]] typically see a one-standard-deviation drop in monthly return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

Since its inception, more than two-thirds of the months for the Algos program have been below the break-even trend level, indicating a consistently difficult environment for diversified [[trend_following_in_various_markets | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Despite these "raining" or "windy" conditions, the system has done what it could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. While its absolute performance might appear worse compared to managers who overweighted equities and bonds, the system has controlled risk well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### Evolution of the Program

Long-term track records in the CTA industry often involve significant evolution and changes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. These changes are driven by manager research, client demand, and adjustments due to AUM fluctuations or market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The Algos program itself has roughly two distinct periods of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Significant changes were made in late 2010/early 2011, influenced by events in 2009 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. The program started with three systems and now uses six, with most original systems still in use with minor changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

### Key Program Statistics

*   **Average Fee Structure:** Approximately 2% management fee and 20% incentive fee, aligning with the industry benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.
*   **Commissions:** Approximately $10 USD per trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.
*   **Maximum Drawdown:** The Algos program's worst drawdown has been 22% (in February 2010) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This is consistent with their rule of thumb that the worst drawdown is typically four times the monthly standard deviation (which is 5.1% for Algos, suggesting a 20% expected drawdown) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. They have managed to stay within this range even as many peers experienced significant increases in drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **Offense-Defense Ratio:** This ratio measures the average winning month divided by the average losing month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. It reflects how quickly a system responds to opportunities (increasing risk/positions) and shrinks during adverse conditions (reducing risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
    *   Average winning month: 4.65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>
    *   Average losing month: 3.42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>
    *   Offense-Defense Ratio: 1.36 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This ratio is considered significantly better than many other diversified [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following programs]], especially given the difficult [[the_impact_of_market_conditions_on_trading_strategies | market conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Winning Months:** Approximately 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Algos Program Trading Strategy

The Algos program consists of six models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

### Market Diversification and Instruments

The program trades 44 markets, exhibiting significant diversification across major sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. It trades currencies, bonds, interest rates, and equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a>. Notably, over half of the markets traded are commodities, giving the program a commodities orientation compared to other managers who may lean more towards finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. All instruments traded are on major Futures exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

### Core Benefit of CTAs

The core benefit of having a CTA in a portfolio is its ability to offset significant, prolonged declines (one month to six months or more) in equity and bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. CTAs serve as a form of "portfolio insurance," providing positive returns when traditional long-only equity or bond investments are declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>.

### System Groups and Design Philosophy

The Algos program comprises three groups of systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>:
*   **Groups 1 and 2:** Primarily [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following systems]] that buy strength and sell weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. They do not react too rapidly, allowing markets some "wiggle room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. These groups incorporate unique approaches to initial risk, entries, and exits to differentiate their performance profile from other [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.
*   **Group 3:** Acts as a counterweight to Groups 1 and 2, reinforcing the portfolio offset function that CTAs aim to deliver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

The program uses robust systems by applying the same rules across all markets, rather than market-specific systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This means no system trades only bonds or only currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>.

### Model Indicators

The Algos program primarily uses **breakout-style systems** rather than moving average crossover systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.
*   **Reasons for Breakout Systems:**
    *   **Avoiding "whipsaws":** Moving average systems tend to generate many unprofitable signals when markets trade in narrow, oscillating ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. Breakout systems help avoid trading during consolidations or narrow price ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:31">[00:34:31]</a>.
    *   **Improving Winning Trade Percentage:** The program focuses heavily on designing effective entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. While typical [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following systems]] might have 30-35% profitable trades, the Algos program, by combining breakout strategies with a small number of conditions, achieves a winning trade percentage closer to 45-50% over long-term tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:16">[00:35:16]</a>.

Breakout systems lead to a discontinuous equity curve, with positions expanding during strong trends and shrinking during weak ones, contrasting with the continuous equity curve of moving average systems that typically have positions on all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>. This choice differentiates the program and contributes to its favorable offense-defense ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

### Trade Execution

*   **Inputs:** The Algos program only requires daily price data (open, high, low, close) to run its algorithmic and systematic program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>. It does not need fundamental data or multiple contract data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>.
*   **Frequency:** It is an "end of day trader," meaning models are run once a day after trading has closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>. This contrasts with intraday traders who constantly update data for new signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.
*   **Order Types:** The program primarily uses three types of orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>:
    *   Spread orders for rolling over positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:10">[00:39:10]</a>.
    *   Occasional market orders for entering/exiting positions (e.g., new accounts, trading errors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>.
    *   Mostly stop orders, where trades are executed only if the price exceeds or falls below a certain stop level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:24">[00:39:24]</a>.
*   **Position Entry:** The program is designed to be "all in or all out," meaning the entire position is put on or taken off at or as close to a single price point as possible, without scaling into positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>.

### Position Sizing and Leverage

Risk control is deeply embedded in the design process of the Algos program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Unlike systems with constant positions, the number of positions held by Algos at any given time is not constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. Initial risk levels for each market and system, along with overall standard deviation, are determined from long-term simulations with robustness checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. All rules for position sizing and leverage are automated within their "Integrated Trading Platform" (ITP), ensuring consistent and disciplined risk management on a daily basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

Central banks play a significant and at times unprecedented role in financial markets, particularly influencing bond and equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. Their actions can create unique market environments that impact investment strategies.

## Historical Impact and Influence
The intervention of central banks, such as the Federal Reserve (FED), has been a key factor in shaping market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. For instance, the initiation of QE2 (Quantitative Easing 2) by the FED, following Dr. Bernanke's speech at the Jackson Hole meeting, allowed for the placement of very large positions in equity markets because the incoming actions were clearly telegraphed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The "unique role" that central banks have played in recent years is acknowledged as a factor that may not be repeated for quite some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>. Data leading into events like the Lehman crisis did not historically indicate the kind of extraordinary influence central banks would come to exert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. This points to a specific and unprecedented effect they had on both bond and equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## Future Outlook
A return to profitability for trend followers and a reignited interest in CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategies could emerge when the [[role_of_central_banks_in_influencing_markets | role of central banks]] in the marketplace begins to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. This suggests that the current environment, heavily influenced by central bank policies, may be a temporary phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

This article explores the critical [[importance_of_research_in_trading_strategies | role of research]] in investment decision-making, drawing insights from conversations with a Chief Investment Officer at Aces Asset Management. It covers perspectives from both the allocator (investor) and the manager (trader) of systematic strategies.

## Investor's Perspective: Evaluating Managers and Strategies

When evaluating managers and strategies, investors place significant emphasis on research capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. The objective is not to find the single "best" investment strategy, but rather "building blocks" that fit into an existing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

### Key Factors for Allocators

*   **Trust in Individuals**: A core consideration is whether the individual running the fund can be trusted with your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The principals are of very high importance; if there is no trust, the quality of the rest of the firm matters less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Personal contact is vital, and a fund that is too "self-important" to deal with properly is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Due Diligence**: Institutional investors typically expect a Due Diligence Questionnaire (DDQ), which is a standardized document answering many common questions about the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This document should contain enough verifiable information to save time in the evaluation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Legal Structure**: Investors assess the fund's legal structure, including whether it is onshore or offshore, and in a jurisdiction where legal recourse is possible if issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   **Track Record Evaluation**:
    *   **Longevity**: A long track record (e.g., 30 years) does not automatically guarantee quality. Large organizations, regardless of their initial success, can become bureaucratic corporate machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Changes in leadership (e.g., founders moving to board roles, non-owner directors running operations) can alter how a business is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Newer Managers**: A five-year track record from a properly audited hedge fund with a custodian and administrator is considered decent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. However, a retail account with self-managed money would lead to greater skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Fitting into a Portfolio**: Investors seek strategies with a specific profile that complements their existing portfolio, rather than an "investment strategy to rule all investment strategies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. This involves evaluating new models based on how they compare and fit in, as the goal is usually not to replace the entire existing portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. The fund itself becomes a portfolio component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

### Key Questions for Investors

When considering [[asset_allocation_decisionmaking | asset allocation]] and selecting strategies, investors should ask:
*   What is the overall goal (e.g., capital preservation vs. wealth building)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>
*   What level of risk is acceptable? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:41:00">[45:41:00]</a>
*   What "building blocks" are needed, and how do they fit together? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:56:00">[45:56:00]</a>
*   Avoid being overly familiar with one type of strategy (e.g., only [[systematic_investment_strategies | trend-following]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:14:00">[46:14:00]</a>.
*   Remain open-minded to new and unconventional strategies that may represent emerging opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:30:00">[46:30:00]</a>.

### Detecting When a Strategy Stops Working

*   **Communication with Manager**: Engage in dialogue with the manager to understand explanations for performance deviations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>. Performance should not be "off" compared to expectations, especially if losses occur in periods where they shouldn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Never accept a "black box" explanation. If the manager cannot provide a satisfactory reason, it might be time to exit the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:38:00">[48:38:00]</a>.
*   **Asking Tough Questions**: Investors should not be afraid to ask detailed questions, such as requesting trade charts with entry and exit points, or attribution analysis for different strategies, time horizons, or market sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:32:00">[49:32:00]</a>. Good managers will usually provide answers to these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:33:00">[50:33:00]</a>.

## Manager's Perspective: Designing Systematic Strategies

When designing [[systematic_investment_strategies | systematic investment strategies]] for external clients, especially collective investments, the following design features are crucial:

*   **Client Needs and Mandates**: The wishes and needs of the client are the primary driving factor, especially for single-client accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>.
*   **Marketing Attractiveness & Explainability**: Strategies for external investors must be clear and explainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. Investors do not want to buy a "black box" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>. Transparency is key, even being willing to explain rules and processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.
*   **Simplicity in Product Design**: While mathematically sound to combine many different models internally, it often does not make for a good product to sell to external investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

### Key Design Features in Systematic Trading

When building systematic trading programs, several elements are crucial:

*   **Position Sizing**:
    *   It is misguided to base position sizing on recent performance (e.g., pyramiding after gains), as past performance does not necessarily impact future probabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>.
    *   Preferable methods involve variations of volatility-based sizing, using a volatility measurement (e.g., Average True Range) as a proxy for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. Positions should be rebalanced at certain intervals or threshold levels to maintain desired risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.
    *   The focus should be on the **portfolio level**, not individual positions. Diversified [[systematic_investment_strategies | systematic models]] trading many markets make individual position results largely irrelevant; the aggregate portfolio result is what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.
*   **Exits**: While important, exits are often overemphasized compared to entries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:02:00">[25:02:00]</a>. The relative importance of entry vs. exit strategies depends entirely on the specific trading model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>.
*   **Environmental Filters**:
    *   For equity strategies, being aware of the overall market "wind" (macro-environment) is helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. Trend filters can provide an idea of where markets are likely to move in a given timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>.
    *   Equity models are often relative models, inherently dependent on the overall market index, meaning great gains cannot be expected if the market is falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>. Futures, however, can potentially make money in any market type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: For classical [[systematic_investment_strategies | trend-following]] strategies, underlying diversification across many markets and instruments is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:32:00">[27:32:00]</a>.
    *   **Sector Allocation**: While sector restraints might be needed for certain models (e.g., to avoid extreme concentration in one country like Japan in an MSCI World stock model), it's less of a concern for futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Corner Risk**: Futures models often rely on "corner risks" â€“ high-risk concentrations in particular areas (e.g., being short the entire crude oil complex). While these can lead to sudden hits, they are also where "really big returns" are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.

### Preferred Systematic Strategies

*   If choosing only one type of [[investment_strategy_and_market_analysis | systematic strategy]], long-term, slow [[systematic_investment_strategies | trend-following]] in futures offers the best long-term potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:04:00">[31:04:00]</a>. These models, though sometimes seen as "lunatic" due to their slow nature, tend to be winners over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:15:00">[31:15:00]</a>.
*   For equity trading, a 12-month momentum model that checks signals weekly and trades once a week can be effective. Less frequent trading (e.g., monthly instead of weekly) can achieve similar performance with lower trading costs and less impact from capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.

## Risk Management

Effective [[investing_strategies_and_risk_management | risk management]] is paramount in investment strategies.

*   **Defining Risk**: The definition of risk depends on the context and situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:49:00">[34:49:00]</a>.
*   **Risk Measures for Clients**: While complex measures like Value at Risk (VaR) and marginal VaR exist, their benefit is less pronounced for smaller teams who are intimately aware of every position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:19:00">[35:19:00]</a>. For larger organizations, aggregating risk at a company level with dedicated systems becomes more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a>.
*   **Stop Losses**: The use of stop losses varies by trading approach. For equity markets, traditional stop losses may not be used, with other methods to halt or close positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>. For some futures models, particularly counter-trend ones, stop losses are vital due to the potential for large moves when trading against the prevailing trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:15:00">[37:15:00]</a>.
*   **Drawdowns**:
    *   The most crucial aspect is ensuring investors understand the potential and likely drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>. Simulated drawdowns will almost certainly be smaller than real ones and occur sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:00">[38:36:00]</a>.
    *   Effective communication about risks helps retain investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>.
    *   Simulations can be used to estimate worst-case scenarios, but it's essential to assume that actual events could be worse and plan for "absolutely unexpected" occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:44:00">[39:44:00]</a>.
*   **Systematic Strengths in Crisis**: In "normal" bad markets, [[systematic_investment_strategies | systematic trading]] excels because the plan is clear, regardless of wins or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:47:00">[40:47:00]</a>. However, during extreme, unprecedented events (like 2008), many classic models broke down as risk management became unmanageable, and unexpected issues arose (e.g., cash held in banks going bust) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>. Post-2008, it is critical to have contingency plans for such "unimaginable" scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:25:00">[42:25:00]</a>.
*   **Managing Stress**: If [[behavioral_biases_and_investment_strategies | worrying about risk]] keeps you awake at night, it indicates a problem that will prevent long-term success in the business. It's crucial to deal with problems and risks during work hours and be able to disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Advice

*   **Motivation**: Find enjoyment and freedom in what you do. Life is too short to be stuck in a "crappy job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:24:00">[51:24:00]</a>.
*   **Recommended Reading**:
    *   Jack Schwager's *Market Wizards* books (especially the first two) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:02:00">[53:02:00]</a>.
    *   *Create and Manage Your Hedge Funds* (author unknown) for inspiring the possibility of starting a hedge fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>.
    *   Kathryn Kaminski's *Trend Following with Managed Futures* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:13:00">[54:13:00]</a>.
    *   Gary Antonacci's *Dual Momentum* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:36:00">[54:36:00]</a>.
    *   Generally, reading more programming books than trading books can be more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>.
*   **Biggest Failure**: Trading involves inevitable losses, such as being heavily invested in Japanese stocks during the tsunami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:59:00">[55:59:00]</a>. While such events feel like the "end of the world" at the time, recovery is often possible within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:20:00">[56:20:00]</a>.
*   **Hidden Talent**: Winning a local chess tournament as a non-club player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:16:00">[57:16:00]</a>.
*   **Valuable Skill**: An inability to conform and a non-conformist mindset, which involves making your own rules and reality rather than accepting imposed nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:18:00">[58:18:00]</a>. This trait can be challenging for managers but is seen as an important skill in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>.

[[trend_following_strategies]] involve selecting a time frame for analyzing market movements. The effectiveness of these strategies can vary significantly based on the chosen time horizon, particularly concerning holding periods and the impact of transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Optimal Time Frames for Trend Following

A common observation in the realm of systematic investing is that [[trend_following_strategies]] tend to perform well for time periods ranging approximately from one month to one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

Beyond a one-year horizon, strategies like value or mean reversion tend to perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Conversely, for periods shorter than a month, the profitability of [[trend_following_strategies]] typically begins to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Faster momentum crossovers, for instance, are generally not as profitable as those with a holding period of at least a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Different Effects at Different Time Periods
The theory suggests that various market effects play out over different time periods:
*   **Momentum** tends to be effective between one month and one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Mean reversion** is often more effective for periods below a month or across multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.
*   For very short time frames, such as a day or a few hours, trends might reassert themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

Research by institutions like Consumer Sock Gen indicates the existence of an intraday momentum effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

## The Challenge of Transaction Costs

One of the most significant challenges with faster [[trend_following_strategies]] is the escalating transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   **Execution**: For fast [[trend_following_strategies]], waiting to execute with limit orders is often not viable because the price is expected to move in the desired direction quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This often necessitates trading at market levels, which can lead to crossing the spread every time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Cost Impact**: These costs can "absolutely kill" profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Even in futures, a relatively cheap asset class to trade, only about a dozen instruments are liquid enough to support very fast strategies while still overcoming transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

For individual traders, even with smaller accounts, transaction costs can be too high to justify very short-term [[trend_following_strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

> "In conclusion I would say there is probably something there but it's really difficult to to capture uh to capture that effect um and I'd say it's it's a kind of playground that you should only play in if your execution abilities are absolutely on point and you you know your your back testing is is really super super good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>

## Lookback Periods vs. Holding Periods

It's important to distinguish between "lookback periods" and "holding periods":
*   **Lookback Period**: The historical data window used to identify a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.
*   **Holding Period**: The average duration a position is held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

There is a relationship between these two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For example, a moving average crossover strategy using 16 and 64 days might have a lookback period of about 50 business days (around two months) and an average holding period of about once a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>.

Analysis of different lookback periods for [[trend_following_strategies]] from 2000 to 2022 suggests a clear gravitation towards longer-term time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Approximately 15 out of 22 annual observations showed optimal performance around the 200-day mark (about one year), plus or minus 25-30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Shorter periods, like 50 days in 2008, could also be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

## When Short-Term Trading Isn't Trend Following

Some very short-term strategies, such as those with holding periods of a few days, might not be considered pure [[trend_following_strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. In such cases, traders might use time stops, price stops, or price targets to exit positions, rather than waiting for a trend to reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. These strategies often seek a quick "explosion of volatility" in a certain direction rather than riding an extended trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

## Considerations for Allocating to Trend Following

When deciding how much to allocate to [[trend_following_strategies]], it's important to consider historical market trends and portfolio optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Historical Bias**: Looking at historical data for traditional portfolios (e.g., 60/40 stocks/bonds) from 1982 onwards can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>. This period saw a secular decline in inflation and interest rates, which flattered returns for both stocks (due to re-rating) and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.
*   **Adjusted Returns**: Adjusting historical returns to remove these secular trends can provide a more realistic expectation for future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>. For example, a 2% annual return from S&P 500 equities and 1.2% from US 10-year bonds were attributed to this re-rating effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>.
*   **Robustness**: Portfolio optimizations can be sensitive to data uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>.
*   **Increased Allocation**: When accounting for these historical biases, the optimal allocation to [[trend_following_strategies]] typically increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>. One study, adjusting for secular trends, suggested that the maximum allocation to a 60/40 portfolio should be around 45%, implying at least 55% for [[trend_following_strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>. Another study using the Société Générale Trend index found an optimal allocation of 64% to the trend index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: While simplifying to a 60/40 portfolio and a basic [[trend_following_strategies]] helps illustrate the point, a full [[trend_following_strategies]] suite with multiple asset classes offers greater diversification benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

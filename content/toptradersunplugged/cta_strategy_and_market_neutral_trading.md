This article explores the CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) strategy and market neutral trading approach employed by Systematic Alpha Management, as discussed by its co-founder and CEO, Peter Campbell.

## Systematic Alpha Management Overview

Systematic Alpha Management is a firm co-founded by Peter Campbell and Alexei Chekhov. The roots of their firm trace back to the late 1990s, with Peter establishing an introducing broker-dealer in New York City in 1998, initially trading tech stocks for individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Following the internet bubble burst in 2000, which caused a major Nasdaq collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, Peter sought a strategy that would perform well regardless of equity market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

In 2000, Peter met Alexei Chekhov, who had prior experience building models for a long-term [[trend_following_strategies | trend following CTA]] called AHL Logic Associates, and also worked at other large firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Alexei's background included working on mean-reverting strategies and fixed income spread trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Together, they developed the firm's core strategies between 2000 and 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

The firm began managing individual accounts in 2001 and launched their first fund in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. In 2014, their futures program celebrated its 10th anniversary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> and received the 2014 Pinnacle Award for best diversified CTA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. They have received four major awards, including similar accolades from HFM Week in 2009 and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Assets Under Management (AUM)

Systematic Alpha Management's AUM for their original program grew from an initial $3-5 million in 2001-2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>, to $20 million in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>, and $80 million in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. It peaked in February 2011 at over $700 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

However, 2011 was a challenging year, resulting in the only negative year on their track record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Due to six consecutive negative months from March to August 2011, and the daily liquidity of over $500 million in managed accounts, their AUM plummeted to as low as $50 million by March or April 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. As of the interview, the firm managed a total of $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

### The Team

The firm is led by Peter Campbell, who focuses on the business side and is described as the "common sense guy," and Alexei Chekhov, who holds a PhD from Princeton University and is the "brains" behind the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This combination of business acumen and academic rigor is seen as a strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. The team is composed of twelve people, with most having stayed with the firm for over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

## Core Strategy: Market Neutral Spread Trading

Systematic Alpha Management's primary strategy is distinct from traditional [[trend_following_strategies | trend-based managers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. It is a market-neutral program designed to perform well in any market environment, without relying on the direction of equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Their correlation to CTAs in general is close to zero, highlighting their unique approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The strategy involves applying concepts from long/short equity trading, statistical arbitrage, and spread trading in fixed income markets to major global equity indices and currency futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Types of Spreads and Arbitrage Exploited

The core essence of their strategy is to exploit temporary divergences in highly correlated global equity markets due to differences in time zones and intraday liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>. While daily correlations between indices remain high and stable, intraday, markets can temporarily diverge, creating mispricings driven by liquidity rather than fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:08">[00:51:08]</a>.

Examples of spread trades include:
*   **Equity Index & Currency Futures:** Trading a spread between the FTSE 100 and S&P 500, incorporating the British Pound currency as a third leg to hedge currency exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>. For instance, if the S&P is up 1% and the FTSE is flat, a trade might be triggered to short the S&P and long the FTSE, anticipating a convergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. They execute longs and shorts at exactly the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.
*   **Domestic Equity Indices:** Trading Russell 2000 against Nasdaq 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. This exploits short-term divergences where small-cap stocks (Russell) may react with a delay to news or moves in large-cap stocks (Nasdaq), causing temporary divergences that later correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Equity Indices & Commodities:** Trading two equity markets against each other with a commodities market as a hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a>. This is used for indices highly correlated to commodities, such as the Canadian or Australian stock markets, which have high correlation to gold, copper, or crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>.

The firm trades approximately 20 to 25 different markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:21">[01:04:21]</a>.

### Trading Characteristics

*   **Holding Period:** The average holding period for a trade is about one day, or 8-10 trading hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>. While they look for reversals within an hour, positions can be held for 2-3 days if not reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>.
*   **Exiting Trades:** Losing trades are exited either via a hard stop (rarely hit, less than 1% of trades) or on a small reversal after holding the position for longer than a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.
*   **Predictive Power:** Their predictive power for the direction of the spread is strong within one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:12">[00:59:12]</a>. Beyond one day, markets become very efficient, and divergences are more likely due to fundamental reasons rather than liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>.
*   **Hit Ratio:** Their hit ratio (percent profitable trades) averages about 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

## Market Environment Impact

While their strategy aims for market neutrality and near-zero correlation to equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, it is not immune to volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Ideal Conditions
> The strategy benefits when volatility is elevated, as divergences tend to be larger and more frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:19">[00:51:19]</a>. Bear markets are often preferred because volatility is typically higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. However, they are not outright "long vol" but long and short vol across different markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

The most crucial factor is *relative volatility* between major indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. The firm prefers conditions where volatility across markets (e.g., US vs. European equity markets) is somewhat similar and not diverging too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

> [!failure] Challenging Conditions
> The 2011 drawdown was attributed to an unprecedented scenario where European equity indices were going down much faster with greater volatility compared to US markets, due to the European debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. For instance, some months saw European indices down 12% while the S&P was flat, creating divergences that were hard for their dynamic models to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>.

Historically low implied volatility, as seen in late 2006/early 2007 and in the months leading up to the interview, makes it challenging for [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic strategies]] to produce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a>. The coordinated assistance from governments around the globe has contributed to these extreme low volatility levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

## Evolution of Strategy

Following the challenging experience of 2011, the firm made important modifications to their system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. While the core idea remains the same, details such as which markets to trade, when to buy/sell, and hedging adjustments are continuously modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>. For example, after 2011, they stopped trading certain European markets and added new markets that were overlooked by most players but still had sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:59">[00:53:59]</a>.

> [!info] Multi-Strategy Program
> In 2011, Systematic Alpha Management introduced a second program: the Systematic Alpha Multi-Strategy Fund program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:11]</a>. This program was developed to provide more diversification after the 2011 drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. It has a 50/50 allocation split between their original spread trading program and directional short-term [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following]] or momentum models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. The idea was to combine two streams of returns that are uncorrelated, and even negatively correlated during times of stress for the spread component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. The directional models tend to perform best when the spread strategies are suffering, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. This aims to reduce the likelihood of large drawdowns, though potentially at the expense of higher correlation to other CTAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>.

## Operational Setup

The firm maintains all main functions in-house, even with current AUM levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:14">[00:37:14]</a>. Key functions include:
*   **Research:** Developing models, programming trading, and back-office functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   **Trading:** Fully automated, with traders monitoring execution rather than making buy/sell decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. They operate around the clock to trade European, Asian, and US markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.
*   **Back Office:** In-house back office functions, many of which are automated, to service managed accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>.
*   **Compliance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>.
*   **Marketing:** Primarily done in-house, though they also work with third-party marketers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.

### Technology

Their research utilizes proprietary software for backtesting models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This tool, developed and constantly upgraded over 7-9 years, uses one-minute resolution data going back many years to estimate trading parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. It supports various in-sample and out-of-sample analyses to ensure model robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:30">[00:38:30]</a>.

## Track Record and Model Longevity

The firm has had only one down year in its ten-year track record (2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. Returns in 2012 were particularly strong, attributed to adjustments implemented after the 2011 experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. While the core idea is persistent, parameter adjustments are made to the strategy. For instance, the look-back window for calculating hedge ratios might be as short as 30 days, allowing quick adjustment to rapidly changing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:32]</a>.

Unlike some other short-term managers who experience significant "model decay" and need new models every couple of years, Systematic Alpha Management's core strategy has remained robust due to its market-neutral, relative value nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. The fundamental arbitrage source—time zone differences affecting intraday liquidity and creating temporary mispricings—is an enduring phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:06">[00:52:06]</a>. They constantly monitor the situation using mean-reversion statistical tests to ensure the phenomenon persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.

This unique position, with little competition in their specific niche, allows them to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. While they acknowledge there will be periods when long-term [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following CTAs]] outperform, their strategy's uncorrelated nature provides significant portfolio diversification and risk reduction for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>.

Russell Korgaonkar, Chief Investment Officer at Man AHL, discusses the role of [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] and managed futures in investment portfolios, focusing on their benefits in [[importance_of_diversification_in_trend_following | diversification]] and providing "crisis alpha" capabilities.

## Trend Following: A Systematic Investment Strategy
Man AHL, with a heritage in [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following]], employs a systematic and active approach to trading across various funds, including Quant Equity and long-only risk-managed strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:37">[03:05:37]</a>. The core philosophy is to identify and exploit small opportunities and inefficiencies across markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:02">[05:00:02]</a>. Success in the systematic space involves not only knowing what to trade but also what not to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

Key drivers for why markets trend and why [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following]] strategies work include:
1.  **Information Diffusion**: Information doesn't flow immediately, taking time to diffuse into a marketplace, making markets less than 100% efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Auto-correlated Market Drivers**: Drivers of market returns, such as interest rates, inflation, or economic data, tend to move slowly and in the same direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
3.  **Behavioral Phenomena**: Human nature, which has been observed in price data for millennia, contributes to price auto-correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This is considered the most compelling reason for trend following's endurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### Evolution of Trend Following Strategies
While basic [[Trend Following Investment Strategy | trend following]] is considered a relatively low-Sharpe strategy with nice [[Risk Management in Trend Following | risk properties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>, ongoing research aims to maximize expected returns for a given risk profile without changing its fundamental defensive characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. Significant improvements come from:
*   Adding genuinely [[diversification_in_trend_following | diversifying]] markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.
*   Adding genuinely different models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>.
*   Efficient trading systems, which allow for the harvesting of a richer set of alphas and enable different sources of alpha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:31:00">[36:31:00]</a>.

The effectiveness of faster [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following]] signals has diminished over time as markets become more efficient, reducing "information leakage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.

## Crisis Alpha: A Feature of Trend Following
[[Trend following and its importance in investment portfolios | Trend following]] was not originally designed specifically to perform during market crises, but it has proven to be a source of "crisis alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. This means it tends to do well when the market performs very poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: Market panics typically unfold over weeks and months, creating sustained trends that [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following]] strategies can capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>.
*   **Reactivity**: A more reactive system is more likely to deliver positive returns in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **Evolution of Value**: While not the original intention, the ability of [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] to provide crisis alpha has become a highly valued characteristic by institutional investors, alongside absolute returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.

Periods of poor performance for [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following]] (e.g., 2010s) were attributed not to crowdedness leading to worse reversals, but to trends being less strong due to central bank actions compressing volatility and increasing market correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:51:00">[46:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:51:00">[47:51:00]</a>.

### Risk Management and Dynamic Position Sizing
[[Risk Management in Trend Following | Risk management]] is crucial. Unlike return predictions, market risk is much easier to predict and is highly time-varying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:25:00">[40:25:00]</a>.

Dynamic position scaling allows for better control of risk and enables the strategy to "stay in the game" during stressful markets, which are often the best environments for [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:52:00">[43:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:07:00">[44:07:00]</a>. This contrasts with a pure stop-loss system, which might lead to losing exposure during critical trending periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Diversification
[[Diversification in trend following | Diversification]] is a fundamental aspect of AHL's approach, seeking to exploit inefficiencies across many different regions and markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

For a broader portfolio, [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] should be viewed as a genuinely [[importance_of_diversification_in_trend_following | diversifying]] return stream to any static investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:33:00">[55:33:00]</a>.

*   **Portfolio Fit**: Allocators should consider [[Trend following in investment portfolios | trend following]] for its properties during environments difficult for the rest of their portfolio, rather than just average correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:54:00">[53:54:00]</a>. The objective is to improve the tail properties of the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00:00">[55:00:00]</a>.
*   **Allocation Sizing**: Historically, optimizations including bonds, equities, and managed futures often suggest a high allocation to managed futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:05:00">[56:05:00]</a>. For institutional investors, a 10-20% allocation is more realistic given benchmark constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:00:00">[57:00:00]</a>.
*   **Timing**: Attempting to time allocations to [[Trend following in investment strategies | trend following]] is generally not recommended due to the difficulty in predicting shifts and the need for quick adaptation and alternative allocations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:21:00">[57:21:00]</a>. Periods of strong performance often follow periods of poor performance, necessitating tolerance for drawdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:26:00">[58:26:00]</a>.

### Challenges with Replication
While it is easy to replicate past returns of [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | sophisticated strategies]], it is much more difficult to replicate their future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>. Replication models based on past returns, while explaining variance, may not have conviction for future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>. To create a truly better system, one would need to replicate positions, ideally ahead of time, and trade them very efficiently, which is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:36:00">[28:36:00]</a>.

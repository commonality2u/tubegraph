[[Trend following investment strategies | Trend following]] is a systematic investment strategy that is often overlooked yet is considered dependable and consistent in the world of systematic investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach involves taking the pulse of global markets through the lens of a rules-based investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Key Concepts in [[Trend following investment strategies | Trend Following]]

### Optimal Lookback Periods and Market Replication
Discussions in [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] include topics like optimal lookback periods for a [[trend_following_investment_strategy | trend following strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It's also possible to replicate a larger market universe using a smaller set of markets, similar to how some replicate CTAs and hedge funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Core Principles
[[Trend following investment strategies | Trend following strategies]] operate with rules-based systems, emphasizing diversification across assets and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. They typically remain uncorrelated to any single asset class over the long term due to this extensive diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>.

A core tenet of [[trend_following_as_a_trading_strategy | trend following as a trading strategy]] is to cut losses short and let profits run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>. This is achieved through design statements like small initial bets, initial stops, and trailing stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. These design constraints define what constitutes a "trend" for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">[00:50:33]</a>. When prices move outside these constraints, the trend definition closes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a>.

[[Trend following trading strategies | Trend following trading strategies]] also trade both long and short, capturing opportunities regardless of directional significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. Capital protection is a priority, and profit targets are generally not used; instead, trailing exits allow systems to ride directional trends for as long as they persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>. This allows for potentially unlimited upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:18">[00:52:18]</a>.

### Skew and Outliers
The design of [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] produces positive skew at the trade distribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>. This means accepting many small losses (e.g., a 60% loss rate) while leaving open the potential for unlimited upside from a few large wins <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. Around 5-10% of trades typically drive the significant portion of total wins, with the remaining wins offsetting the numerous small losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>. This "lifting power" comes from the impact of outliers in the trade distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>.

### Diversification in [[Trend following in investment portfolios | Investment Portfolios]]
Diversification is essential for [[trend_following_in_investment_portfolios | trend following in investment portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. Bringing together uncorrelated return streams from many markets (e.g., 60 markets) produces a smoother equity curve at the portfolio level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>. While outliers from individual markets are infrequent, diversification increases the overall frequency of outliers across the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. These outliers are ideally distributed throughout the portfolio's time series, allowing for optimal compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:57">[00:56:57]</a>. This diversified approach can make the portfolio seem deceptively smooth, hiding the underlying volatility and pain of individual market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>.

An example of this is the performance in short-term interest rates in 2022, which delivered significant gains for [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] after years of near-zero rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. This demonstrates why markets are kept in a portfolio even if they don't produce returns for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

### Market Behavior and Edge
[[Trend following investment strategies | Trend following strategies]] uniquely attack "non-linear anomalies" or outliers, which are orders of magnitude greater than linear losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:41">[01:01:41]</a>. This not only smooths volatility but also improves the compound annual growth rate of a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

The ability of markets to trend is linked to their non-normal distribution, characterized by "leptokurtic" signatures with distinct left and right tails and a peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. This signifies a quantitative "edge" available through price action, specifically two forms:
*   **Convergent practices**: Target the edge around the equilibrium of market returns, where markets are stable and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>. The majority of market participants (around 90%) employ convergent techniques, which include fundamental investing (e.g., value investing assuming reversion to intrinsic price) and most technical analysis based on repeating patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>. High-frequency trading and central bank interventions (buying/selling dips) also exert convergent forces to stabilize markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a>.
*   **Divergent techniques**: Focus on the left and right "tails" of the distribution, representing extreme price actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:12">[01:06:12]</a>. These are non-predictive, price-following, and reactive in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. Only a small percentage of participants (around 10%), like [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | diversified systematic trend followers]] and some option buyers, specialize in these divergent approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:54">[01:10:54]</a>.

### Performance During Adversity and Boom Times
While the overall correlation of the TTU [[Trend following index | Trend Following Index]] to the S&P 500 over 22 years is low (around -0.1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:35">[00:37:35]</a>, a closer look reveals a "conditional correlation":
*   **Periods of adversity**: During sustained periods of market decline, [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] exhibit negative correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Examples include the tech collapse (2002-2003), the Global Financial Crisis (2008), the Trump trade wars (2018), the COVID decline, and the period of declining equity returns in 2022 due to inflation and the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. In four out of five such periods over 22 years, the TTU [[Trend following index | Trend Following Index]] was negatively correlated to equities, leading to significant returns for [[Trend Following Investment Strategies | trend following programs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.
*   **Periods of boom**: During periods of significant equity market growth, [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] show positive correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. This includes the period after the tech bubble collapse (2003-2008), the resurgence after the GFC (2011), 2014-2015, and 2020-2021 before the recent adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. In four clear instances during boom periods, a positively correlated relationship was observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

This means [[trend_following_strategies | trend following strategies]] not only provide protective cushioning during adversity but also offer "bonanzas" during boom periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. Unlike bonds, which traditionally provided cushioning but limited "lifting power" (which has now diminished) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>, [[Trend following investment strategies | trend following]] offers both cushioning and significant lifting power to the overall portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:52">[00:44:52]</a>.

### Trader Behavior and Wealth Flow
The reason for this dual performance lies in how market participant behavior alters during periods of market uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. When the predictive models of the majority (convergent traders) break down, they are forced to exit positions, which can amplify trends (creating a divergent impact) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. Some may also try to "average down" and increase leverage, only to face margin calls, further amplifying market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

This leads to a "wealth flow" from convergent to divergent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>. While [[trend_following_strategies | trend followers]] maintain their consistent approach (cutting losses short), the mass exit of convergent traders creates a non-linear amplification of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>. This shift in participant behavior, driven by fear and greed when predictive models fail, is what allows [[Trend following investment strategies | trend following programs]] to benefit significantly during both periods of market boom and bust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:51">[01:14:51]</a>.

## Position Sizing
Position sizing is a critical aspect of [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend following strategies]] and risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. As risk managers, the focus is on influencing risk rather than controlling performance, as performance is not directly controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

### "Pant Sizing" and System Simplicity
The concept of "loose pants" in a [[trend_following_investment_strategy | trend following strategy]] refers to the simplicity of the system design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Systems with fewer parameters (e.g., 4-5 maximum parameters for entry, stop, and trailing stop) allow greater freedom for price movement, as they less constrain how price needs to move to stay within system constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This simplicity helps respond to degrees of freedom in price and avoids large error functions if the future doesn't exactly replicate the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

For different lookback periods (e.g., short-term, medium-term, long-term), the ATR-based (Average True Range) initial and trailing stops are typically tighter for shorter-term systems and wider for longer-term systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. ATR is used to normalize the trading system to any liquid market, allowing the same model to trade diverse assets like Bitcoin, currencies, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. These different models aim to capture various facets of a trend, from short-term momentum to more "wandering" trend cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

### Kelly Criterion
The Kelly Criterion is a mathematical formula that optimizes position sizing to maximize geometric returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. It considers historical win percentage, loss percentage, and return-to-risk relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

However, the Kelly Criterion demands stable returns and exact knowledge of expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. It is a very aggressive formula, leaving no room for error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. If the underlying statistics (win rates, return-to-risk) wander or if market regimes change (non-stationarity), applying Kelly can lead to "deep water" due to its aggressive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. Even using half or quarter Kelly variations (watering down the leverage) can still be problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

For [[trend_following_investment_strategies | trend followers]] who target the "tail regions" of return distributions—where there is no stable mean or standard deviation and conditions can be chaotic—the Kelly Criterion is generally avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. In these regions, markets are not normally distributed, exhibiting "leptokurtic" characteristics with extreme variations and different regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>.

Instead, a common approach is to use a standard, very small risk bet for every single return stream in the portfolio, with equal weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. The portfolio's overall magnification abilities and its hunt for outliers drive compound annual growth rates, rather than aggressive discrete position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

While Kelly may be useful for "convergent" trading styles that seek predictable, stable regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>, it is not suitable for [[trend_following_trading_strategies | trend following trading strategies]] that deal with the chaotic, non-stationary nature of market tails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

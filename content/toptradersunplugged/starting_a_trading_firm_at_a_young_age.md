Peter Campbell, co-founder and CEO of Systematic Alpha Management, began his entrepreneurial journey in the financial world at a remarkably young age, establishing his first broker-dealer in New York City when he was just 21 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This venture, which started in 1998, initially focused on trading tech stocks for individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, having "nothing to do with features at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Background and Motivation

Campbell's path to founding his own firm was shaped by his early experiences and a keen eye for opportunity. Born in Moscow, Russia, he moved to New York on September 11, 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. He attended public high school and college, graduating with a finance degree "Magnum Cum Laude" around 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Despite his strong academic performance, finding a job in finance was challenging at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

His very first job was at a broker-dealer, where he earned $250 per week after passing his Series 7 license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. After about four months, he left to seek other opportunities, eventually finding a small [[building_and_growing_a_boutique_investment_firm | boutique firm]] that specialized in private placements and small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. It was here that a pivotal moment occurred: after introducing high net-worth Russian contacts to the owner, who subsequently made "nice money," Campbell realized he was not going to receive a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This experience directly motivated him to start his own firm, leveraging his connections and entrepreneurial spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Evolution of the Firm and Partnership

The initial broker-dealer operated successfully during the bull market of the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. However, the internet bubble burst in 2000, leading to a major collapse in the Nasdaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This challenging period spurred Campbell's desire to develop a strategy that would perform well "in any market environment" and not rely on the direction of equity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:05:04]</a>.

This led to his meeting Alexei Chekhov in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Chekhov, who had a PhD from Princeton University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a> and extensive experience building models at firms like Trend Logic Associates and a French bank, brought the necessary quantitative expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:33]</a>. Campbell provided the "initial setup infrastructure and initial clientele" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The partnership blended their distinct strengths: Campbell as "the common sense guy" and "business guy," and Chekhov as "the brains and not like the blood of the company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:15:09]</a>.

Together, they spent a year, from 2000 to 2001, developing their [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These strategies were initially offered to individual investors through managed accounts starting in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The firm formally launched its fund in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This foundation laid the groundwork for their market-neutral program, designed to perform regardless of market direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Growth and Resilience

From 2001 to 2004, their assets under management (AUM) ranged from $5 to $10 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. By 2005, AUM exceeded $20 million, growing to $80 million in 2006, and eventually peaking at over $700 million in February 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:22:08]</a>.

Despite significant growth, the firm faced a major setback in 2011 with a severe drawdown, leading to a loss of 90% of their assets due to investor redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:53]</a>. Their AUM dropped to as low as $50 million by March or April 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:14]</a>. However, the firm adapted, implementing adjustments to their system following this experience, which contributed to strong returns in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:42:05]</a>. Today, with about 100 million AUM, Campbell believes the firm is "stronger than ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:02:01]</a>.# Starting a Trading Firm at a Young Age

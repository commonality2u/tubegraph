## Introduction
The "Top Traders Unplugged" podcast, hosted by veteran hedge fund manager Nils Koster Larson, provides insights from leading hedge fund managers, including Richard Dennis, creator of the Turtle program, and two of his former students, Brian Proctor and Jerry Parker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The podcast emphasizes that all discussions about investment performance are about the past, and past performance does not guarantee future results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. It also highlights the significant [[risk_management_in_trading | risk of financial loss]] with all investment strategies, underscoring the need to understand specific risks from investment managers before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## [[risk_management_in_trading | Risk Management]] in Trading
[[risk_management_in_trading | Risk management]] is a critical component of successful trading, with discussions often revolving around volatility, position sizing, and discipline.

### Volatility Targeting
Many highly successful CTAs now use a constant volatility targeting approach, aiming for specific levels like 10%, 15%, or 20% volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Richard Dennis, however, has expressed that he never fully understood the issue with volatility, suggesting that investors can manage their own exposure by simply adjusting the amount of money they put in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Jerry Parker views volatility targeting as a "more sophisticated way of taking profits before the trend reverses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. He believes that a daily return of 5% plus or minus is too much volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Parker emphasizes that his firm has no interest in volatility targeting, considering it just another method of taking profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He gives an example of his [[position_sizing_and_risk_management_in_trading | risk management]]: risking 50 basis points on a losing trade, but allowing winning trades to draw down significantly (e.g., 500 basis points on a gold trade from $800 to $1900) before a trailing stop is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Brian Proctor notes that in the late 1980s, when the Turtle program ended, the risk-free rate was much higher, making investors more accepting of volatility and drawdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. As interest rates have fallen, so has the appetite for volatility among investors, who now seek lower volatility products to fit their mandates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. While EMC Capital Advisors has slightly reduced volatility in its flagship program, it has also developed newer programs with different volatility targets to cater to investor preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Exits and Discipline
In discussions among successful systemic traders, the trade exit is often considered the most important aspect among entry, exit, and [[risk_management_in_trading | risk allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. A potential weakness of trend-following, if not executed well, is giving back a significant portion of open profits when a trend reverses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Jerry Parker recalls that while trading for Richard Dennis, he reached a point where he could consistently follow the rules, particularly regarding the taught exit strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. He managed to avoid "great ideas with a sample size of ten" and stuck to the rules for exits, viewing discretionary trading as something to be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. He acknowledges making "bad thoughts" that he didn't act on, and doing a trade "not by the book" early in his career, which felt "crazy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Brian Proctor explains that the Turtle program removed much of the psychological pressure by not risking their own money, making it easier to follow rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, it was painful to watch profitable trades turn into losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. After becoming independent, consistency became much harder, especially during long losing periods, when there's an inclination to make changes to avoid similar experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Key Takeaways
Brian Proctor highlights that the most important concepts from the Turtle program were having strict [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]], avoiding over-trading, accepting losing trades, and not exiting winning trades until the trend is confirmed to be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. He states that [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] was "rule key concept number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## System Development and Adaptation
System development involves creating and refining trading strategies based on rules, research, and adaptation to changing market conditions.

### The Role of Rules
Richard Dennis emphasizes that "the rules are your guardian angel" in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. Jerry Parker agrees, noting that "the rules are so important" and there are many ways of not following them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. He views sophisticated programming of bad ideas, like volatility targeting, as "systematic discretion" or "counter-trend philosophy" embedded into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. He maintains that his current approach is very similar to how he traded previously, just without these "bad elements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

### Research and Innovation
Brian Proctor's second key concept from the Turtle program was to "keep looking at new ways or new systems," blending different values and time frames to improve existing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. His firm has invested heavily in research infrastructure to continually search for the "next best great system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

Jerry Parker acknowledges the extensive research his firm has conducted, coding nuances for entries and exits into systematic approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>. However, he finds it "shocking how little of the research we've actually implemented" and regrets some implementations in hindsight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. He believes that the cost of research is changing, and trying to change too much can be a "derivative of not following your rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

### Adaptation vs. Consistency
Jerry Parker believes his firm's approach has maintained the overall philosophy of the Turtle program, but has become "just longer term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. He argues that adapting too much by optimizing to recent data (ignoring sample size requirements) is generally not a good idea, even if clients prefer it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

A quote from a large European CTA suggests that a simple technical trading rule cannot consistently generate profits year after year, and that any investment strategy that does not adapt to continuously changing markets will experience diminishing performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

Jerry Parker counters this by stating that short-term trend following does not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, but there is a "sweet spot that works really well and it's worked for a long long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. He argues that fundamental market changes and shifting relationships/correlations are naturally captured by his trend-following entries and exits, without needing to constantly change the core system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

Richard Dennis also finds the idea that strategies must constantly adapt to changing markets "vastly overstated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. He notes that while market dynamics might change, reducing the correlation or expectation of a trend-following system can grind down profits after costs, but this isn't an academic argument for constant, radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

### Challenges in Today's Markets
Richard Dennis states that if he were to teach a Turtle program today, he "wouldn't teach the same thing" because objective trading is "just harder to do now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. He attributes this difficulty to "exaggerator variables that kind of truncated trends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Brian Proctor believes that the low return period for trend-following in recent years has been made more difficult by central bank intervention and government policies that have reduced liquidity in many markets, which he thinks are "designed to make it difficult for professional money managers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Despite this, he remains cautiously optimistic that trends will emerge, particularly in commodity markets where central banks have less control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. He emphasizes the need to remain involved, take trades, and identify new trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

Jerry Parker attributes the current low return period to a "lack of trends" and high diversification, with only stocks currently trending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. He considers this a "lack of trends," not necessarily a "system failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. He voices concern that volatility targeting among large CTAs contributes to market instability, citing instances like the sharp movements in gold in August 2015 and frequent "crashes" when long-term trends reverse and volatility spikes, as many managers try to exit at the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

Richard Dennis experimented with counter-trend trading models 10-15 years ago but found "almost nothing" that worked consistently or frequently enough to be worth the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. He describes one simple, decent system that would buy if a price dropped extremely low, but it happened only "two or three times a year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. He agrees with John Maynard Keynes's adage that "the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
Despite challenging market conditions and debates over adaptation, the core principles of the Turtle program—strict [[risk_management_in_trading | risk management]] and systematic rule-following—remain central to the philosophies of its successful alumni. Brian Proctor observes that the question "is trend-following dead?" arises frequently at hedge fund conferences, often just before periods of good performance, reinforcing his confidence in the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>.

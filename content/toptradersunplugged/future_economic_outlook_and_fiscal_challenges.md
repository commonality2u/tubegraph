The global economy is at a pivotal point, facing significant challenges that demand deep analysis from experts. Steve Moran, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute and Senior Strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, offers insights into market dynamics, economic policy, and future [[global_economic_and_financial_challenges | global economic and financial challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## The Unique Standing of US Treasuries and the Dollar

The US Treasury market and the US dollar continue to hold a dominant position in the global financial system due to their liquidity, reliability, and depth, allowing them to absorb significant transactions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. Despite desires from some entities to reduce reliance on the dollar and treasury, there isn't a viable alternative that is large and deep enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>. For instance, the gold market is not large enough, and even current flows cause its price to soar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. Many crypto assets have built-in deflation, with supply declining over time, making them unsuitable for funding increasing transactions and savings, unlike the growing supply in the treasury market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.

## Activist Treasury Issuance (ATI) and Monetary Policy

Moran co-authored a paper with Nouriel Roubini titled "Activist Treasury Issuance and the Tug of War Over Monetary Policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. The paper explores why the economy has remained resilient despite significant monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve, including a shift from massive Quantitative Easing (QE) to Quantitative Tightening (QT) and nearly 5.5% in policy rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. While many predicted a financial apocalypse or deep recession, growth has been strong, and markets "phenomenal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

The paper suggests that "Activist Treasury Issuance" (ATI) plays a role in explaining this [[economic_resilience_and_macroeconomic_outlook | economic resilience and macroeconomic outlook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. ATI refers to the Treasury's tactical shift to issue more short-term bills and fewer longer-duration bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. This strategy aims to avoid upward pressure on long-term yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### Economic Channel of ATI

The economic channel of ATI is similar to QE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. Both work by altering the distribution of public debt from interest rate risk-bearing assets to those that do not bear such risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   **QE:** The Fed buys interest rate risk-bearing debt, exchanging it for bank reserves (money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
*   **ATI:** The Treasury limits the creation of duration-bearing notes and bonds at the source, issuing more bills that are now close substitutes for bank reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

In both scenarios, the money supply increases, and the public's exposure to interest rate risk-bearing securities decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. This process, known as the "portfolio balance channel," encourages a greater appetite for other forms of risk, flowing through the economy and stimulating growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. The paper estimates that ATI's effect is equivalent to approximately a one-point cut in the Fed funds rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>. While material, this is not the sole explanation for the economy's buoyancy and sticky inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

### Treasury's Policy and Market Timing

Historically, the Treasury's written policy framework dictates that it does not market-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. Its objective is to achieve the lowest long-term cost to taxpayers over decades, not to react to short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>. Attempting to time the market could lead to errors, especially given the persistent market expectations of Fed cuts and interest rate declines that have not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:00">[17:14:00]</a>.

Moran highlights the inconsistency in the Fed's stance on QT versus QE:
> "If you wanted to say that QE doesn't work and neither does ATI, I don't agree with that position, but it's an internally consistent position. If you want to say that QE works but ATI does not, I do not view that as an internally consistent position that that's a contradictory position in in in my mind and the Fed's insistence that QT has no is not policy has no has no effects whereas QE does I I mean that just strikes me as as quite silly cognitive dissonance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.

Every transaction, in Moran's view, has an effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.

### "Term Out" Risk

A significant downside of ATI is the "term out" risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. Eventually, the Treasury will have to shift from issuing bills back towards longer-term bonds, which could put upward pressure on bond yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>. The IMF has flagged this risk, noting the over-reliance on short-term issuance raises the risk of higher interest rates in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. However, Moran doesn't believe this risk is currently driving recent yield increases, partly because future Treasury policies are uncertain due to impending leadership changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.

## Labor Market and Economic Growth

Moran assesses the labor market as remaining in "pretty healthy shape," despite some weakening from a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:52:00">[27:52:00]</a>. The increase in unemployment in the first half of the year was concentrated among new entrants and re-entrants, especially younger demographics (16-24 age groups), who may have benchmarked their expectations against the "once in a generation" labor market of 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>. Weakness in Q3 included temporary layoffs, anomalous weather, and auto retooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:00">[29:14:00]</a>.

Moran views the labor market dynamics as similar to "bullwhip cycles" seen in goods and commodities during 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>. Companies over-hired during a surge in labor demand and are now slowing hiring to allow revenues to catch up to headcount, rather than aggressively cutting staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. This reduced hiring rate, while a concern, is not indicative of a sharp decline in aggregate demand across the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>. GDP growth remains strong, sprinting closer to 3% than 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>.

## The Neutral Rate Debate (`r*`)

The debate around the neutral interest rate (`r*`) is critical for policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>. Moran is confident that the neutral rate is "materially above where the Fed thinks it is" because GDP growth remains robust despite policy supposedly being restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:58:00">[34:58:00]</a>. While acknowledging the difficulty in pinpointing `r*` precisely, if one considers the five-year, five-year TIPS (inflation-protected treasury interest rate) as a proxy for the long-term real interest rate (around 1.9-2%) and adds the Fed's 2% inflation target, the nominal neutral rate would be around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:39:00">[35:39:00]</a>. This suggests that the current effective Fed funds rate, when considering ATI, might be closer to or even below neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>.

Moran advocates for central banks to be less like "micromanagers," recognizing the significant measurement error in inflation data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>. He argues that obsessing over small deviations from a precise inflation target is "profoundly silly" given the inherent methodological choices and measurement challenges in constructing inflation metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>. A sense of neutral is necessary to understand whether policy is stimulative or restrictive, but policymakers should avoid overreacting to minor data wiggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:57:00">[39:57:00]</a>.

## [[us_economic_outlook_and_presidential_election_implications | US Economic Outlook and Presidential Election Implications]]

The upcoming election will have significant economic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:46:00">[40:46:00]</a>.

### Tariffs

A key differentiator between potential administrations will be tariff policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00:00">[42:00:00]</a>. Moran challenges the common economist view that tariffs are inherently inflationary. He points to the 2018-2019 period, where a non-trivial increase in tariffs had "zero discernable macroeconomic impact" on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16:00">[42:16:00]</a>. This was largely because the tariffs were offset by movements in the currency (e.g., dollar strength against the Chinese yuan), which maintained the after-tariff dollar import price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:45:00">[42:45:00]</a>.

### Regulatory Policy and Supply Side

Another major difference lies in supply-side policy, particularly regulatory policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:14:00">[44:14:00]</a>. Regulatory burden, such as those related to permitting, climate, land use, and licensing, significantly impacts the economy, even if difficult for economists to measure precisely due to their diverse and heterogeneous nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:20:00">[44:20:00]</a>. This burden can amount to several percentage points of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.

Moran cites examples:
*   **Auto industry:** Requirements for automatic idling disablement in cars (as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act) add costs to production, making American auto manufacturing less competitive and contributing to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27:00">[46:27:00]</a>.
*   **Semiconductors:** The EPA has created an entirely separate regulatory apparatus for semiconductor manufacturing, adding significant compliance burdens (monitoring, testing, inspections) at a time when billions are funneled into the industry for national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:00">[47:48:00]</a>.

These policies, despite government efforts to stimulate certain sectors, raise production costs, suppress potential growth, and contribute to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:49:00">[48:49:00]</a>. Moran suggests this regulatory difference is a significant reason for the contrast between the non-inflationary 3.5% unemployment rate in 2019 and the highly inflationary 3.5% rate in 2022-2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:35:00">[45:35:00]</a>.

## Debt Limit and Long-Term Fiscal Challenges

The debt limit, suspended last year, will be reinstated at the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:18:00">[51:18:00]</a>. The Treasury General Account (TGA) is projected to end the year with around $700 billion, which, combined with "Extraordinary Measures" (borrowing from other government pots), could push the "X-date" (when the government runs out of money) to approximately the third quarter of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:33:00">[51:33:00]</a>.

Spending down the TGA acts as a significant liquidity injection into financial markets by converting public savings into private sector expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>.

### Medium-Term Outlook for Fixed Income

On a medium-term basis, Moran expresses concern about the bond market unless deficits are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:11:00">[54:11:00]</a>. Deficits are the fundamental driver of high bond supply and will weigh on interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:20:00">[54:20:00]</a>. The "term out" of T-bills will also be significant if and when it happens, though there's no legal requirement for the Treasury to revert to longer-term issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:35:00">[54:35:00]</a>.

The most pressing concern is the accelerating worry over US fiscal solvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:17:00">[55:17:00]</a>. The Social Security trust fund is projected to expire in 2033, and the Medicare Hospital Insurance Fund in 2034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:25:00">[55:25:00]</a>. At these points, the government will be unable to meet all its obligations with current expected revenue, necessitating difficult decisions on how to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:35:00">[55:35:00]</a>. This highlights [[future_implications_of_fiscal_restraint_and_demographic_changes_on_the_economy | future implications of fiscal restraint and demographic changes on the economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:25:00">[00:55:25]</a> and points to [[future_economic_challenges_and_crises | future economic challenges and crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.

## Advice for Macroeconomic Analysis

For those interested in macroanalysis, Moran advises:
1.  **Study central banks:** They are critical as they choose interest rates that move fixed income and other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:10:00">[58:10:00]</a>.
2.  **Look beyond central banks:** Many focus only on central banks and view all markets through that lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:28:00">[58:28:00]</a>. However, other policies, particularly supply-side policies, matter enormously for economic growth and evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:38:00">[58:38:00]</a>. Taxes, regulations, permitting, climate policies, and labor licensing all influence long-term growth by affecting decisions about investment, compensation, business organization, and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:41:00">[58:41:00]</a>.

> "Central banks matter, you have to learn about central banks, but you should also go out of your way to learn to learn about how the supply side of the economy works and and what types of government policies on that on that side doe in the effects that they'll have" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

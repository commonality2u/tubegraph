## Introduction to IPM's Systematic Approach
IPM, co-founded by Anas Lindell, is a prominent hedge fund managing over $7 billion, known for its systematic global macro strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:03">[02:18:03]</a>. The firm's approach is entirely systematic, with all processes coded into software, allowing for scalability independent of the number of people employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:01">[03:00:01]</a>. This systematic methodology aims to avoid emotional decision-making and ensure discipline in implementing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Formative Experiences and Philosophical Underpinnings
Anas Lindell's early career was significantly shaped by extreme [[The Impact of Market Conditions on Trading Strategies | market events]], which instilled in him a foundational philosophy for trading:
*   **1987 Equity Crash:** A personal experience of significant loss during the 1987 equity market crash underscored the importance of thoroughly understanding the intricacies of trading before engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:39">[01:17:39]</a>.
*   **1992 Swedish Central Bank Attack:** During this event, overnight rates in Sweden reached 500% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:56">[01:54:56]</a>. This, along with the 1994 Fed rate hike, highlighted the need for a long-term outlook, patience, and solid analysis in the face of extreme market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:45">[01:48:45]</a>. Lindell noted that individual data points can be misleading, emphasizing the importance of observing longer-term [[Global macroeconomic trends | macroeconomic developments]] rather than focusing on daily noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.

This background led to a conviction that economies change slowly and moderately, making drastic overnight turns rare in developed markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:12">[02:09:12]</a>.

## Addressing Traditional Asset Allocation Challenges
IPM was founded in early 1998 to address challenges faced by institutional investors, particularly pension funds and life insurance companies, in managing their **tactical asset allocation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. Traditionally, these entities relied on in-house economists, investment banks, and research to inform monthly or quarterly investment committee decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>. This process was often subject to "a lot of noise" and typically led to modest, incremental changes (e.g., shifting from 60/40 to 58/42 bond/stock exposure) that rarely made a significant impact on the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:27">[01:42:27]</a>.

Inspired by US firms offering investment services based on solid information and repeatable methods, IPM sought to provide a more structured approach to tactical asset allocation decisions for European institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## IPM's [[Systematic macro trading approach | Systematic Macro Trading Approach]]
The core objective of IPM's strategy is to take risk proportionally to identified opportunities, aiming for a consistent return stream (e.g., 10% net per annum) at a predictable risk level (e.g., 10% volatility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:04">[05:04:04]</a>.

### Key Principles:
*   **Fundamental Input:** The models are built on [[Market trends and macroeconomic factors | fundamental macroeconomic input]], concerned with factors like GDP levels, inflation, and changes in money supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:09">[05:22:09]</a>.
*   **Mean Reversion:** The strategy relies on markets responding rationally to fundamental variables over a reasonable time frame, with a belief in mean reversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:54">[05:22:54]</a>. This means if markets deviate from fundamental developments, they are expected to revert within a timeframe of one to one and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:57">[05:29:57]</a>.
*   **Relative Trading:** IPM primarily engages in relative trading, comparing markets against each other (e.g., US equities vs. German equities, Canadian vs. Japanese government bonds) rather than focusing on absolute levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:52">[04:09:52]</a>. This makes the strategy less sensitive to changing market regimes or absolute [[geopolitical_and_macroeconomic_factors_influencing_markets | macroeconomic environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:52">[04:10:52]</a>.
*   **Global Composites and History:** Everything is modeled in relation to global composites and its own history, often expressed as Z-scores (number of standard deviations from long-term equilibrium). This approach helps to normalize data and avoid biases from short-term market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. For example, when analyzing Japanese Government Bond (JGB) rates, IPM compares their risk-adjusted deviation from normal trading behavior against a global composite, rather than directly comparing them to T-notes, which would always appear expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>. The "norm" is established by using as much historical, reliable information as possible to avoid being caught off guard by shifts in central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:15">[01:07:15]</a>.

### Model Structure:
The model is structured across five sub-models and four common themes (risk factors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>:

#### Sub-Models (Asset Classes):
1.  **Emerging Market Currencies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:09">[01:01:09]</a>
2.  **Developed Currencies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>
3.  **Equities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>
4.  **Fixed Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:13">[01:01:13]</a>
5.  **Directional Components:** A "global asset class decision" that allows for being long or short both global stocks and bonds, a departure from the traditional balanced approach (e.g., 60/40) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This philosophical shift was prompted by the recognition that asset allocation correlation structures have changed, and a dollar-based balance doesn't imply risk neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

#### Common Themes (Factors) across Sub-Models:
1.  **Value:** Identifying mispricings based on fundamental valuation drivers (e.g., purchasing power parity for currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.
2.  **Risk Premium:** Capturing premiums for taking certain risks (e.g., carry in currencies, yield in bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:58">[01:01:58]</a>.
3.  **[[Impact of macroeconomic factors on volatility | Macroeconomic Factors]]:** Analyzing the impact of changes in variables like money supply, government debt issuance, and trade balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.
4.  **Market Dynamics:** Idiosyncratic factors specific to each asset class, such as the yield curve for bonds or cross-border investment flows for currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

## Adaptability and Market Environment
The strategy is designed to perform well in environments where markets respond rationally to fundamental developments and mean revert over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:09">[05:22:09]</a>. However, it can be vulnerable in periods where fundamentals are disregarded, and markets are primarily driven by external forces (e.g., central bank actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Despite the increasing integration of global economies and the influence of central banks, which might reduce opportunities for relative trading within regions (e.g., European equities), IPM continues to find opportunities by:
*   Expanding into new asset classes, such as Emerging Market currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:06">[04:46:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   Exploring other equity markets and asset classes in the research pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   Recognizing that even in a controlled environment, relative trading remains meaningful as markets still trade around each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

The strategy is evaluated over a three-year moving average due to its long-term nature, accepting that significant dislocations may temporarily move against positions before eventually reverting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. While the macro environment has changed considerably over the past 10-15 years, particularly with central bank interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, fundamental factors like relative inflation will always play a role in pricing currency pairs over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. IPM's view is that many asset markets, particularly fixed income and equities, are currently in "very stretched territory" due to cheap money, and a "rough ride" is likely when this changes, although central banks are expected to avoid drastic moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Strategy
IPM's model undergoes continuous, long-term evolutionary process, typically introducing two to three changes annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. These changes can include:
*   Additions of new risk factors or sub-models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   Introduction of new risk analytics methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   Incorporation of entirely new models or asset classes (e.g., Emerging Market currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

The firm focuses on identifying weaknesses and areas for improvement within its existing model, then seeking specific talent or conducting targeted research to address those areas, rather than broadly scouting for "general sources of alpha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

The global order has shifted from a unipolar world, dominated by American hegemony, to a multipolar one, characterized by multiple centers of power and increased geopolitical competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This shift, which began around the early 2010s, makes global modeling more complex for investors compared to the previous unipolar or bipolar (Cold War) settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. While the [[uschina_relations_and_geopolitical_dynamics | US-China relations and geopolitical dynamics]] aim to create a clear bipolar structure, the world is increasingly multipolar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>.

## Evolution of Trade Policy

The shift in [[uschina_relations_and_geopolitical_dynamics | US-China relations and geopolitical dynamics]] and trade policies is driven by a geopolitical evolution and a move away from "laissez-faire capitalism" towards a more interventionist, "deist" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This change in approach is expected to last for at least 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Trump's Influence on Trade
Donald Trump's presidency in 2016 unleashed a nationalist, protectionist movement in US trade and economic policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. His approach was to use protectionism as a tool to secure deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. A potential second Trump administration is seen as capable of concluding trade and foreign policy deals with rivals, including [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]], with little domestic resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>. An example of this is Trump's suggestion of Chinese companies building factories in the US Midwest, which would likely receive public applause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

This policy direction does not signify a return to 1990s-style globalization, but rather a "landing of the protectionism plane," resolving some issues for both the US and [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] and creating a new stable equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. This environment remains capital expenditure intensive, requiring significant commodity inputs for redesigning supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>.

## China's Response to US Trade Policies

[[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] has already adapted to this new trade environment by "enemy shoring," investing in American national security priorities by building factories in other countries to circumvent US restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) has skyrocketed in countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Mexico, as Chinese companies rebuild supply chains and move factories abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>. This has led to an improvement in the US trade deficit with [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]], but a deterioration with the rest of the world, indicating that globalization continues within Trump's established framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.

## US-China Relations and Global Alliances

The US has actively tried to establish a clear bipolar structure, attempting to convince Europe, Japan, South Korea, and India to align against Russia and [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:21">[00:52:21]</a>. However, the rest of the world does not perceive [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] and Russia as true allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. Despite their "endless friendship" agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>, [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] has not provided significant military aid to Russia and has maintained an arms embargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:51">[00:58:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. While [[chinas_economic_policies_policies_and_market_impact | China]] imports Russian oil, India, an American ally against [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]], has increased its imports even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

[[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]]'s focus is on maintaining a strong relationship with the rest of the world, particularly Europe, the Middle East, and the Global South <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] seeks to drive a wedge between the US and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This is evident in actions like recalling its controversial ambassador to France and trying to improve rhetoric and commercial ties with Europe to secure Western technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:27">[00:54:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>. Such relationships, like France's continued commercial dealings with [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]], highlight the fluid and promiscuous nature of international relations in a multipolar world, unlike the rigid alliances of the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:33">[01:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.

Global South countries like Saudi Arabia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Brazil are increasingly aware that neither [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] nor the US possess the overwhelming power of Cold War superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. This incentivizes them to be "geopolitically promiscuous," leveraging both powers for financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>.

## China's Domestic Challenges and Geopolitical Aspirations

While [[chinas_economic_trajectory_and_global_influence | China]] still harbors aspirations of becoming a global superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>, its domestic situation is currently a significant constraint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. The country is in the midst of a secular stagnation and a private sector deleveraging, necessitating a focus on reviving its domestic economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:23">[01:03:23]</a>. This makes [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] more dependent on external sources of demand, as domestic demand continues to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:41">[01:03:41]</a>.

### Outlook on [[chinas_geopolitical_moves_and_taiwan | Taiwan]]
For the next five years, [[chinas_geopolitical_moves_and_taiwan | China]] is unlikely to invade Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:57">[01:02:57]</a>. This assessment is based on several factors:
*   **Domestic Focus:** [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]]'s internal economic challenges take precedence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.
*   **Lessons from Ukraine:** Observing the Western response and the impact of civil society's "cancellation of Russia" on the Russian economy has given [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:52">[01:03:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **No Imminent "Clock":** The Chinese Communist Party has maintained legitimacy without resolving the Taiwan issue, suggesting there is no urgent timeline for an invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>.
*   **Risk-Reward:** The potential for a complete economic collapse due to global reorientation and protectionism poses a much greater risk to [[chinas_economic_policies_and_market_impact | China]] than not conquering Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:03">[01:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:13">[01:05:13]</a>. Beijing is not expected to make such a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.

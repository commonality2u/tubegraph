The global economic system, largely defined by free trade and [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | global supply chains]], was established by the United States after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This system, maintained by the U.S. Navy, allowed any country to participate in global trade and access raw materials in exchange for aligning with the U.S. during the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This fostered specialization, trade, and economic expansion, leading to widespread urbanization and industrialization, and a global drop in birth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

However, this era is ending, ushering in [[Fragmentation and deglobalization trends | deglobalization]] and significant [[future_economic_challenges_and_crises | economic challenges]].

## The End of the Globalized System
The United States has lost interest in maintaining the globalized system, as evidenced by seven consecutive anti-globalist elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Coupled with this, advanced economies now lack sufficient young people to regenerate their demographic structures, and baby boomers are moving into mass retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This decade is projected to see an investment, production, and consumption bust, for which the current economic model is ill-equipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated these trends by a couple of years, and the Ukraine war serves as a "hard stop" to the old order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

There will be no return to the "normal" consumption and production balance of 2019, as the demographic system has fundamentally shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Impact on Major Economies
### China's Decline
China was arguably the biggest beneficiary of the globalized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, its economic decline is considered "well past the point of no return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Key factors contributing to China's impending collapse:
*   **Demography**: Its population likely peaked in 2003 and has been overcounted by possibly 100 million people, making its demographic situation more terminal than Germany, Russia, or Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Labor Costs vs. Productivity**: Labor costs have increased by a factor of 15 since 1999, while productivity has only doubled, indicating technology has not significantly shifted the pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Dependence on Imports**: China imports 85% of its energy, with 85% of that coming from the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. In a conflict scenario where these supply lines are cut, China would de-industrialize within months, potentially leading to mass famine within six to twelve months, affecting 500 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Ukraine War Impact**: China is the biggest loser from the disruptions to agricultural, industrial, and energy markets caused by the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Sanctions Vulnerability**: The types of sanctions imposed on Russia, if applied to China, would "destroy the regime in less than a couple of months" due to China's reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Boycotts**: The widespread boycotts and departure of foreign companies from Russia due to consumer pressure are particularly alarming for China, as foreign corporations and market access are crucial to its development model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.
*   **Zero-COVID Policy**: China's ineffective vaccine means full lockdowns are their only tool against COVID-19, leading to cities like Shanghai and Guangzhou being locked down. This makes China an unreliable partner in [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | supply chain]] manufacturing, effectively removing itself from the global system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Europe's Challenges
Europe faces a significant energy crisis, expected to lose 4-5 million barrels of crude per day from Russia within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. To maintain energy supply, Europe may need to adopt a "neocolonial" approach, forcing former African colonies to redirect their energy flows to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:18">[00:44:18]</a>. This presents a challenge to the concept of liberal multi-party democracy in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>.

The Euro, while a political project, faces severe [[Global Economic and Financial Challenges | economic challenges]] in a deglobalizing world due to aging societies and a lack of consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## Broader Economic Consequences
### Shift in Economic Model
The world is transitioning to an era where the economic "pie" will shrink due to population collapse, rather than growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. There is no existing economic model for such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. This will likely lead to state dissolution in more places than seen in the last 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.

### Financial System Implications
*   **Stocks vs. Bonds**: Stocks require stable systems with high liquidity, which will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. Many smaller stock markets are expected to disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>. Bonds will see increased demand, but at extreme costs due to limited investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **Currency**: Historically, metal-backed currency systems have failed due to over-expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:22">[00:56:22]</a>. Fiat currency, based on trust, is the only viable option. In a deglobalizing world, few countries will be trusted, likely leaving the U.S. dollar as the sole globally traded currency of size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   **Investment Landscape**: The period of "bottomless supplies of capital" is ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>. Capital will become more expensive and harder to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Investors must conduct thorough homework and cannot rely on broad index funds or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.
*   **Government Role**: With increased populism and fiscal intervention, governments will have a larger role in investment and capital allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

### Food Insecurity
Globalization allowed agricultural specialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. In a deglobalized world, countries will become more responsible for their own food production, reducing specialization and bringing staple crops like wheat back to the core of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>. This shift, combined with disruptions in fertilizer supply chains due to the Ukraine war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>, could reduce the world's calorie output by more than half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. In the best-case scenario without wars, humanity faces a shortfall of at least three billion people that cannot be supported, potentially leading to widespread famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:19">[01:15:19]</a>.

### Technology's Role
While technology has advanced dramatically, its impact on global trends like demographics and economic shifts is limited. The speed of technological advancement globally is expected to slow due to a lack of young, clever people and declining capital bases in most regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>. The U.S. may be an exception due to its younger Millennial generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.

The power of technology to control populations, as seen in China's "1984 style" surveillance, represents an unprecedented experiment in technocratic government control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:01">[01:48:01]</a>. However, such autocratic systems are historically unstable if basic needs are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:35">[01:50:35]</a>.

In essence, the world is entering a period of significant economic transformation, characterized by simultaneous breakdowns in [[Global Supply Chains and Economic Fragility | manufacturing]], transport, energy, and agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>. This new era, akin to the 1930s-1960s but in "hyperdrive," will be marked by conflicts over economic models and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:45">[01:12:45]</a>.

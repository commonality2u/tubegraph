Interest rates play a fundamental role as the "universal price" within a capitalist system, affecting nearly every aspect of the economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>. The understanding and manipulation of interest rates by central banks have profound and often unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

## The Price of Time: Edward Chancellor's Exploration

Financial historian and journalist Edward Chancellor's book, *The Price of Time: The Real Story of Interest*, delves into the multifaceted nature of interest rates, drawing on extensive historical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:06">[04:10:06]</a>. His work explores how [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | very low interest rates]] can lead to a "weak and fragile ecosystem," akin to over-fertilizing an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a>.

Chancellor's journey to writing *The Price of Time* began after publishing *Devil Take the Hindmost* in 1999, a book on financial speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:05">[05:37:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Influenced by Dr. Henry Kaufman's discussions on the Federal Reserve's manipulation of the fed funds rate following the Long-Term Capital Management collapse in 1998, Chancellor started to consider the monetary aspects of speculative manias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:13">[06:28:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:06">[07:01:06]</a>. The subsequent dot-com bust and the Fed's aggressive lowering of the fed funds rate to one percent ignited a global credit boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

Working at GMO during and after the Global Financial Crisis, Chancellor observed that interest rates went even lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. His research, including collaboration with Jamie Lee, revealed that [[Trends in interest rates and potential implications | interest rates are not mean-reverting]], challenging conventional economic models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. He realized that through the lens of interest rates, one could understand the global economy, financial markets, and even popular discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

Chancellor also observed the immense credit and real estate booms in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>, seeing them as the greatest booms in history, explainable through the perspective of interest rates and monetary policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. He concluded that central banks' sole focus on short-term inflation, when setting interest rates in a low-inflation environment, creates conditions for speculative and credit bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.

### Economic History and Policymaking

Chancellor notes a decline in the study of economic history and the history of economic thought in academic departments, leading to a loss of rich insights from earlier writers on interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[01:4:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[01:14:19]</a>. This phenomenon is partly attributed to the misapprehension that economics is a hard science, where questions are "solved" and no longer need re-examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[01:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[01:15:52]</a>. There's also a drive to make everything comprehensible within mathematical models, which can exclude the ideas of earlier economists like Hyman Minsky and Friedrich Hayek, who are "difficult to model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[01:16:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[01:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[01:17:53]</a>.

> "The economists are under possibly a misapprehension that their subject is a science and that once a question has been addressed and so to be solved you no longer need to think or re-examine that question." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:32">[01:15:32]</a>

This disregard for history means that lessons, such as those from the 1920s regarding price stabilization policy and speculative bubbles, are not learned, leading to repeated crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

## [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy]]

Chancellor argues that [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | ultra-low interest rates]] have a causal, long-term effect on economic performance, contrary to the view that monetary policy only affects the cyclical part of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Savings and Debt Accumulation

Traditionally, interest is seen as a reward for abstinence and an encouragement to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. However, [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | very low interest rates]] can slow the compounding of wealth, leading to less future consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This effect is compounded when low rates encourage increased debt, as seen in the build-up of private sector debt (e.g., in the U.S., UK, Spain, Ireland) before the subprime crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Richard Koo's "balance sheet recession" thesis explains how excessive debt after a boom drags down demand as households focus on deleveraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Low rates can also encourage current consumption by making it difficult for people to save enough for future goals like retirement, forcing them to save more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

Different cultural responses to low interest rates exist; for example, Anglo-Saxon countries, with higher exposure to real estate and stock markets, experienced less pain from low rates compared to Germany, where more people rent and hold assets in cash or bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### "Zombification" of Companies

[[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | Low interest rates]] contribute to the phenomenon of "zombie companies"â€”firms with too much debt and low returns on capital that are allowed to stay in business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This was first identified in Japan in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Post-Euro debt crisis, countries like Italy and Greece had unexpectedly low insolvency rates because the ECB's "whatever it takes" policy instituted loan forbearance through [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | very low interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

The presence of zombie companies harms efficient businesses by forcing them to pay higher interest rates, and it leads to less job creation, less investment, and fewer new market entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. This hinders "creative destruction" and contributes to low returns on capital and stagnant productivity, creating a cycle where [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | low rates]] beget low growth, which in turn begets even lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Misallocation of Capital

[[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | Ultra-low interest rates]] encourage the most speculative investments because the cost of capital is effectively free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This leads to "malinvestment," where capital is tied up in "roundabout methods of production" or "pie in the sky ventures" that may never yield profits, like some "unicorns" in the tech sector (e.g., Uber, WeWork) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Such ventures, often "casino chips" designed for high valuations and IPOs rather than generating useful economic functions, absorb vast amounts of capital that could be used more productively elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

While some argue that bubbles, like the telecoms boom of the late 1990s, can lead to long-term infrastructure benefits (e.g., fiber optic cables), Chancellor suggests that often, the benefit is a transfer of wealth from investors to consumers, and the overall allocation of capital for society is inefficient, sometimes even leading to sub-optimal technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Globalization and Supply Chains

[[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | Low interest rates]] have facilitated the existence of complex global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Historically, periods of declining [[Impact of Interest Rates on Markets | interest rates]] have coincided with rampant globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Access to cheap labor globally and dampening of domestic labor's bargaining power induce a decline in [[Impact of interest rates and bond market movements | interest rates]] and lead to disinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

The low cost of dollar funding, supported by the dollar's global reserve currency status, encourages companies to extend their supply chains further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. However, the creation of very long supply chains makes them potentially fragile to [[Impact of rising interest rates on markets | rising interest rates]], supply shocks (like the COVID-19 pandemic), and political backlash from workers who feel their jobs are being outsourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This highlights a feedback loop where [[Interest rates and currency trends | low interest rates]] contribute to globalization, which in turn creates fragility and political discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

## Central Bank Policies and Consequences

Central bankers have often been criticized for a narrow focus on inflation, which can destabilize other areas of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Historically, figures like Ben Strong of the New York Fed in the 1920s and Alan Greenspan in the late 1990s adopted a "clean up afterwards" view, believing it was not their business to prick asset bubbles due to potential collateral effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

This approach, exemplified by the dot-com bubble and the 2008 crisis, is likened to the nursery rhyme "There was an old lady who swallowed a fly"â€”each attempt to solve a problem with intervention creates a bigger, more complex problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. This leads to a "Ratchet effect" where each central bank intervention, often driven by [[The carry trade and interest rates | carry trades]] and debt growth, necessitates larger subsequent interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

> [!quote] The Forest Fire Metaphor
> Edward Chancellor uses a metaphor from the chapter on Creative Destruction: "The central Bankers, when they prevent the process of creative destruction, they're a bit like the US Forest Service that prevents forest fires, and in the end you get, you know, build up of understory and and so forth and until eventually you get more fires and more severe fires as a consequence and and are less healthy Forest." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>

### [[Interest rates and monetary policy | Interest rates and Monetary Policy]]

The inflation mandate, particularly a narrow, specific target, is seen as flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Early criticisms of price stabilization as the sole aim of central banking were put forth by economists like Friedrich Hayek in the 1920s, who argued that it could lead to economic imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. Despite the Great Crash of 1929 and subsequent depression, which demonstrated the severe price instability that can result from such policies, this lesson does not seem to have been learned by modern policymakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

Ben Bernanke's interpretation of the Great Depression, largely borrowed from Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, suggests that nothing was wrong in the 1920s until the Fed tightened too much and allowed the money supply to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. This perspective, however, overlooks Hayek's real-time critique of the price stability policy of the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Threat to Capitalism

Chancellor posits that [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | zero interest rate policies]], though currently somewhat reversed, pose a genuine threat to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. If interest rates approach zero, there is effectively "no capital" as capital is the discounted value of future income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

In a system where [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | low interest rates]] lead to low productivity, low investment, low savings, and financial fragility, ever-greater state intervention becomes necessary to offset these dysfunctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This has been seen in central banks not only taking [[Impact of shortterm interest rates on investments | interest rates to zero or negative]] and buying government bonds, but also intervening in credit markets and even influencing areas like "green investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This represents a "creeping advance of... Central Bank capitalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

For a capitalist system to work, it must deliver productivity and economic growth, and allow ordinary people to accumulate capital, buy houses, and save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. When [[Impact of Low Interest Rates on Economy | zero interest rates]] make retirement savings and other forms of security (like housing or education) more expensive and out of reach, fewer people support the system, causing it to "atrophy" from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

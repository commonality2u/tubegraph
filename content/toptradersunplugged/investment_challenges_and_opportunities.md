Top Traders Unplugged is a platform designed for individuals seeking to learn from leading hedge fund managers, aiming to advance their manager due diligence or [[investment_strategies_and_risks | investment career]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. It's crucial to remember that discussions about investment performance pertain to the past, and past performance does not guarantee or even infer anything about future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. There is a significant risk of financial loss with all [[investment_strategies_and_risks | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, and specific risks should be understood from the investment manager before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Turtle Program: A Case Study in Investment Training

The "Turtle Program" was a unique trading experiment initiated by Richard Dennis, a veteran hedge fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He started trading around age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> and was a floor trader for 14 years before moving off-floor to trade more markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. His first introduction to trend-following came through old books and hand-based research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

The inspiration for the Turtle Program stemmed from Richard Dennis's realization that much of his own successful trading followed informal rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. He observed that while other traders also operated by rules, some of these were detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. He estimated that two-thirds of trading was about following rules, and one-third was intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. To resolve the debate of whether trading could be taught, he decided to train people by giving them rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The program was put into motion within a couple of months of this idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

The name "Turtles" originated from Richard Dennis seeing a turtle farm in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The popular myth that it was inspired by the movie *Trading Places* is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Application and Selection Process
Applicants for the Turtle Program, such as Jerry Parker, responded to advertisements in publications like The Wall Street Journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The process involved a test with 100 true/false and discussion questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, followed by interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Richard Dennis preferred applicants who had not previously traded on the floor, as prior knowledge could be a detriment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. He also looked for people with statistical aptitude, leading to the selection of professional blackjack players who understood odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Despite selection efforts, he notes that initial expectations for individual performance were often incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

Brian Plachta, a "second-wave" Turtle, had a different entry, already working for Richard Dennis's firm, C&D Commodities, as a runner and back-office staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Richard Dennis suggested it was a better career path than trading on the floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Training and Philosophy
The Turtles received "great training," lasting two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This training provided sufficient knowledge and extensive support from Richard Dennis and his partner, Bill Eckhardt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. A key aspect was "trader for a day" sessions, offering deeper understanding of the trading philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

Richard Dennis believes that rule-oriented trading is essential for success, as it fosters the necessary persistence that is difficult to maintain with mere judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. He states that "mediocre rules are better than good traders' judgment" because a system ensures 100% persistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.

Initially, all Turtles were allocated the same amount of money, but allocations were adjusted based on their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Richard Dennis did not publicly discuss the program while it was ongoing, preferring anonymity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

## Modern Investment Challenges and Strategies

### Evolving Market Conditions and Trend-Following
The fundamental philosophy of trend-following, which involves identifying robust systems with minimal parameters to initiate, liquidate, or avoid trades, remains relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. The core idea is to capture directional price movement and manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

While the principles endure, specific implementations may change. For instance, modern trend-following strategies might harvest profits along the way, differing from the original Turtle program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. A significant challenge in today's markets is the lack of volatility, which Richard Dennis considers a more pressing issue than adjusting the system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

### Diversification in Portfolios
Diversification across markets is a key component of successful trend-following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. Jerry Parker advocates for trading as many liquid markets as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, while acknowledging certain markets like the VIX index are not well-suited for trend-following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. It's crucial to manage the risk budget across different sectors and markets to avoid excessive correlation, especially in areas like bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

Jerry Parker emphasizes including equities (long and short) in a diversified portfolio, sometimes dedicating a significant portion of the risk budget to them, as stocks can be the primary source of returns in certain periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. He believes that criticisms of the stock market by trend followers are misplaced when there are clear trends present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

For Richard Dennis, the choice of markets to trade is predominantly dictated by liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. He notes that a portfolio might naturally end up with an approximately equal balance of commodities and financials (e.g., 15-20 of each) because that's where the liquidity lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. Correlation between different commodities is not a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>.

### Investor Adoption and Misconceptions
Despite evidence supporting the benefits of trend-following—such as access to uncorrelated markets, ability to go long and short, taking small losses, and letting winners run—only a minority of investors have made it a core part of their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

Brian Plachta attributes this to several factors:
*   **Volatility and Drawdowns:** The return stream of trend-following can be difficult for institutional investors to accept due to internal rules about volatility and drawdown thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.
*   **"Black Box" Perception:** Investors often view systematic trend-following as a "black box" they don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Brian argues that discretionary trading is the true "black box" because the decision-making process is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.

Richard Dennis adds that the strong performance of hedge funds relative to CTAs (managed futures) in the past decade, combined with a stock market that more than tripled in eight years, diverted allocations away from trend-following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Jerry Parker points to historical fees and expenses, as well as volatility, as barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. However, he notes a recent shift, with inflows into CTAs in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. He observes that investor focus often shifts to firm size and number of PhDs rather than market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Scott Billington, co-founder and managing partner of Covenant Capital Management, discusses the critical role of discipline and systematic methods in successful trading, particularly within [[Systematic and Discretionary Trading Approaches | systematic trading]]. He emphasizes that human nature is not inherently wired for effective trading, making structured approaches essential for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Overcoming Human Biases with Systematic Trading

A key advantage of a [[philosophies_of_systematic_trading | systematic method]] is its ability to remove human emotions and opinions from trading decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Billington admits to having personal opinions that would typically interfere with a trade, but a systematic approach allows him to set those aside and methodically apply the established method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This discipline is something he is particularly proud of at Covenant Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

For example, when Covenant Capital experienced a 20% loss in its second year, they did not alter their [[Systematic trading strategies | trading philosophy]] or deviate from their method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. They had a pre-written "in case of emergency break glass" plan that they adhered to, which proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Most firms, he notes, would have folded under similar pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## The Importance of Position Sizing

Once a non-random method of entry and exit is established, the entire outcome of a trading strategy is largely determined by position sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Billington asserts that having a small edge with proper position sizing is far superior to having a large edge with improper sizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. Mis-sizing positions can even turn a strategy with a positive expected outcome into a loser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

He illustrates this with a coin-flip example: if one risks too much (e.g., 30% of their bankroll) on a favorable bet, they can still lose money even if the expected outcome is positive, due to the nature of geometric returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. He recommends an optimal risk level, such as 8% in his example, where risking more or less can lead to reduced profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

Covenant Capital has always used a standard fixed fraction of account size to determine risk and has been aware of their optimal risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. While their methods for sizing positions and viewing risk have evolved, the core principle remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

## Risk Management in a Systematic Context

In systematic trading, every position has a defined stop-loss, allowing the firm to calculate the exact amount of money at risk daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Maximums are set at both individual position and portfolio levels, and if these limits are hit, position sizes are reduced to stay within acceptable parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

Covenant Capital's programs vary in their maximum risk levels: the original program has a 25% maximum, the aggressive 30%, and the optimal 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

Billington notes that for [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]], markets tend to correlate more highly when they matter most, specifically when trades are running favorably and risk builds up across multiple positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. They assume every sector is highly correlated when evaluating risk, focusing on controlling drawdowns by ensuring the portfolio never risks more than a preset level of account value from an equity high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

He contrasts this with large financial institutions that often use complex models to calculate "smart expected risk," which frequently fail during tough market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. For Billington, risk is viewed simply: the difference between the current market price and the stop-loss is the money at risk, and that needs to be controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

## Long-Term Perspective and Robustness

Despite market downturns or periods where [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]] is declared "dead" by some, Billington asserts that it remains the most successful and repeatable trading method, alongside value stock investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. He highlights historical evidence and the ability of peers to replicate results as proof of its robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

He acknowledges that [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]] is weak in sideways markets or at the end of trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>, but emphasizes that the handling of large moves is what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>. Losing trades are managed to lose a fixed unit of risk, while winning trades can yield many multiples of that unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:53">[00:37:53]</a>.

## Qualities for a Successful Trader

*   **Analytical Mind and Probabilistic Thinking:** Essential for understanding market dynamics and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Being Wrong:** Traders must be comfortable admitting mistakes, especially in [[Systematic trading and trend following strategies | trend following]] where a high percentage of trades might be losers (e.g., 70% in Billington's case) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:08">[01:03:08]</a>.
*   **Discipline:** A core trait to consistently follow a proven system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.
*   **Self-Control:** The ability to manage personal opinions and emotions that might otherwise interfere with objective trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Good Health and Avoiding Substance Abuse:** Trading is a stressful endeavor, and maintaining physical and mental well-being is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.

Billington suggests that aspiring traders should first ensure they have enough operational capital to last five years without income, to allow their business to "sprout roots" without immediate financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:02">[00:52:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>. He also stresses the irreplaceable value of [[The role of systematic trading and programming skills | programming skills]] in modern trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

## Investor Due Diligence: Beyond Statistics

Billington believes investors often miss asking crucial qualitative questions during due diligence, focusing too much on operational aspects rather than the core trading methodology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:29">[00:46:29]</a>. He suggests questions such as:
*   How many parameters are used in your method? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:34">[00:46:34]</a>
*   What effect do small changes (e.g., 5-8%) to your parameters have on returns? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:36]</a>
*   How did you pick the specific numerical values for your parameters (e.g., a 50-day window)? You should ideally see a "smooth, kind of plateau" of results around the chosen number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
*   What were your "luckiest" and "least lucky" periods? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>
*   How do you handle costs, especially if you trade less frequently? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:17]</a>

These questions probe for [[systematic_quantitative_analysis_in_trading | robustness]] and repeatability of the trading strategy, which are more indicative of long-term viability than short-term performance statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. He also recommends that individuals with actual trading experience, not just allocation experience, should conduct these due diligence processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

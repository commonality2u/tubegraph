From: [[toptradersunplugged]] <br/> 

The adoption of [[role_of_technology_in_financial_trading | technology]] and [[automated_trading_systems | automation]] has fundamentally reshaped financial trading, moving it from subjective decision-making to a more objective and disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Early pioneers in [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]] experienced a significant advantage due to the novelty of their methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Early Days: "Shooting Fish in a Barrel"

In the nascent stages of [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]], particularly in commodities, the market was dominated by small investors or those trading "by the seat of their pants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This environment provided an immense opportunity for early adopters of [[automated_trading_systems | automated trading systems]].

> "Anyone who was one of the [[challenges_and_advantages_of_early_systems_trading | early systems traders]] would confirm this is that we first got started technical trading, it was like shooting fish in a barrel because there were very few people doing it... just the [[the_role_of_discipline_and_systematic_methods_in_trading | discipline that a system provided]] was an incredible advantage over most of the traders that were out there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

At this time, almost any system, even simple ones like a moving average crossover, proved effective because it offered a significant edge over discretionary trading or relying on broker advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. Today, the industry is largely dominated by [[systematic_trading_strategies | systems traders]], creating a much different and more competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## The Dawn of Personal Computing in Trading

A key turning point for automation in trading was the advent of personal computers. Bill Dries, a pioneer in the field, initially sought to automate his business processes, especially accounting, due to the sheer volume of clients (180) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

In 1976, Dries acquired one of the earliest personal computers, an Altair, which he used to program an accounting system that proved more accurate than those of brokerage firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This initiative was the primary motivation for adopting personal computers, with the automation of his trading system following later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

## From Subjectivity to Objectivity: The Fractal Wave Algorithm

Traditional technical analysis, relying on subjective interpretations of patterns like "heads and shoulders" or "triangles," was deemed largely meaningless by early systems traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. The only useful patterns were found to be trend lines and support/resistance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

Inspired by Benoit Mandelbrot's work on fractal geometry, particularly its application to market modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, Bill Dries and his colleague developed the "fractal wave algorithm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This algorithm deconstructs prices into a series of fractal patterns, characterized by self-similarity across different time scales, with the "zigzag" being the fundamental pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

Unlike approaches like the Elliott Wave, which impose restrictive patterns (fives and threes) on price data, the fractal wave algorithm builds from the bottom up, allowing for variable wave counts determined by the price action itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

The primary purpose of this [[artificial_intelligence_and_trading | automated system]] is not prediction, which is considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>, but to provide a mechanical and objective means of identifying turning points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. This eliminates the subjectivity inherent in manual trend line drawing, ensuring consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Benefits of Automation

*   **Discipline and Consistency**: The system provides unwavering [[the_role_of_discipline_and_systematic_methods_in_trading | discipline]], eliminating second-guessing and irrational decisions that often plague human traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>. The system will make trades that might appear irrational to a human technician at times, but this is the trade-off for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: Automation significantly reduces the time required for trading and back-office tasks, making it possible to manage a large number of clients and trades with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. A fully automated system can take as little as half an hour a day and a couple of hours on the weekend to run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>.
*   **Reduced Transaction Costs**: By trading less frequently on longer-term charts (e.g., weekly), automated systems can lower transaction costs from slippage, even if commissions are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.
*   **Insulation from Market Psychology**: Being a [[systematic_trading_strategies | systems trader]] helps insulate one from external opinions and psychological biases common in trading environments, particularly for those geographically removed from major financial hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:46">[00:51:46]</a>.

## Evolution of the Industry and System Design

The trading industry has evolved from a landscape of mostly small, discretionary traders to one dominated by [[systematic_trading_strategies | systems traders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This shift raises questions about arbitrage and the continued effectiveness of trend-following strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>.

Despite the dominance of [[systematic_trading_strategies | systematic trading]], proponents argue that underlying fundamentals and market persistence provide ongoing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:47">[00:37:47]</a>. Markets are not random; they exhibit biases and persistence, meaning trends tend to continue longer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. This theoretical basis, supported by fractal mathematics, validates the potential for trend-following methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

Regarding [[simplicity_in_trading_strategies | simplicity in trading strategies]] and parameters:
Automated systems can be designed to minimize [[evolution_of_trading_systems_and_strategies | data fitting]] or over-optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. Instead of optimizing numerical parameters, some systems focus on fundamental patterns where parameters naturally emerge from the structure of the algorithm itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. For example, in a fractal system, a larger-scale zigzag might inherently have a duration about three times that of a shorter one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. While backtesting is necessary, the aim is to avoid the delusion of finding "magical" results from excessive parameterization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

Risk management in [[automated_trading_systems | automated trading systems]] is seen as common sense and driven by the realities of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:56">[00:43:56]</a>. Established systems traders, despite varied methodologies, often operate within a similar "ballpark" of risk and exposure, leading to comparable performance when normalized for leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:54">[00:44:54]</a>. The market itself provides the returns, and a well-designed system aims to capture what the market offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>.

## Challenges and Perceptions

Despite the clear benefits of automation, there remains resistance from some investors, particularly on the institutional side, who may prefer more traditional "brick and mortar" setups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. The lack of a formal office or a large number of employees can be a perceived hurdle, even if many functions can be outsourced or run virtually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. However, sophisticated investors often have no concerns about streamlined, automated operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:02">[00:58:02]</a>.

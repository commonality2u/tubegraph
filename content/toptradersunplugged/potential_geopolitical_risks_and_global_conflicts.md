Market volatility can be overdone, especially when considering the current [[geopolitical_landscape | geopolitical landscape]], the upcoming election, and other global factors [03:15]. There are significant structural changes occurring across markets [03:22].

## China-West Bifurcation

Chinese policymakers are strategically timing their market interventions, such as the "big bazooka" stimulus measures, to leverage periods of broad market positivity and positive flows towards the end of the year [19:25], which is expected to be beneficial for their markets and broadly for global markets [20:04].

While China's market recovery is drawing attention, a long-term risk exists due to a potential bifurcation between China and the West, particularly the US [23:39]. Historically, when countries dramatically underperform in valuation over multi-year periods, they tend to mean revert, often leading to a multi-year upward move [20:46]. However, there are counter-examples like Russia or Iran, where markets remained "left for dead" for decades due to larger structural issues such as a lack of rule of law, fear of asset expropriation, and inability to interact in foreign markets [21:16]. The fear is that China might follow this counter-example, as there's a perceived lack of trust and belief in China's ability to protect foreign assets [21:56]. If a true [[global_conflict | global conflict]] emerges between China, Russia, and Iran, investing in Chinese assets could become particularly dangerous long-term [24:00].

A significant question is whether the upcoming US election could lead to a détente with China [24:41]. While there's potential for a meaningful mean reversion in Chinese assets in the short term (until December-January), the long-term trajectory will largely depend on the election outcome [25:01].

## Election Impacts on Global Markets

The US presidential election, particularly the November 8th date, introduces significant fear of contested elections [15:01]. This has contributed to a much larger "skew" in the market, favoring downside protection over upside potential [15:08]. The market is currently experiencing a "wall of worry," which is a structural phenomenon driven by supply and demand [17:06].

Regardless of the election outcome, the very short-term (two-week to one-month post-election) is expected to see naturally positive structural flows due to the high skew and the release of event volatility [41:09]. However, this short-term positive effect may not persist into January [41:31].

### Policy Differences and Inflationary Pressures

The primary focus when evaluating the impact of different candidates on markets should be inflation and populism, both in rhetoric and actual policy [41:50]. The key drivers of structural inflation include:
*   Fiscal policy [42:50]
*   [[global_conflict | Global conflict]] [42:54]
*   Labor costs [42:57]
*   Protectionism [42:58]
*   Commodity and input prices [43:01]

#### Trump Administration
A Trump administration's economic policy is expected to be broadly stimulative [44:05]. He would likely exert pressure on the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy on his behalf in the short term, similar to a figure like Erdo an who doesn't adhere to traditional monetary policy [44:14]. This could create a massive cyclical positive for markets in the short term but drive a worse structural, secular inflationary pressure, akin to the Nixon era [44:51].

From a [[global_conflict | global conflict]] perspective, a Trump presidency, with its isolationist stance, could be seen as a "green light" for China to act more quickly against Taiwan, possibly within the next year [48:22]. This is because Trump has expressed a policy of not providing support without payment [48:11]. While this could lead to a quicker, more abrupt [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical move]] and potentially a faster resolution (e.g., 1-3 years), which would be bullish for Chinese assets, it carries significant immediate risk [49:25].

Trump may also seek a deal with Saudi Arabia, providing security guarantees in exchange for cooperation on energy, which could be stimulative and less inflationary than under a Harris administration [51:40].

However, one of the most significant potential inflationary pressures under a Trump administration is immigration policy [52:49]. A hardline stance on closing borders and reducing immigration could lead to persistently hotter labor inflation in the US, offsetting other rebalancing pressures [53:39].

A Trump win would likely mean control of both the House and Senate due to historical voting patterns, granting him significant power to enact policies [55:11]. This could lead to dramatic policy impacts and would be seen as a mandate [56:36].

#### Harris Administration
A Harris administration's policies, focusing on taxing capital gains and wealth redistribution, are also considered inflationary, though perhaps more measured and less cyclically extreme than Trump's [45:57]. This approach could lead to a more stagflationary environment [46:12].

In terms of [[global_conflict | global conflict]], a Harris presidency might see a more prolonged period of tension with China, with any significant move potentially waiting longer (e.g., 3-4 years) but potentially resulting in a larger, continued global conflict [50:50]. A Harris win would likely result in a mixed bag for House and Senate control [57:21].

### Long-Term Outlook

Regardless of the candidate, the broader structural inflationary period, often referred to as a "populist period," is generally very bad for equities and bonds [57:56]. During such periods, the cost of money rises, leading to compressed equity margins and increased appeal of bonds as an alternative investment [58:01]. For example, the 1960-1982 period saw markets go nowhere and lose 70% of their value in real terms [58:26].

However, paradoxically, recent "populist" election years have shown exceptionally strong market performance, with average gains of 21% and 100% winning percentages [59:03]. This is attributed to contested elections, massive fiscal stimulus by the incumbent party to win votes, and a holding pattern in [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical activities]] during the election year [59:56].

> [!CAUTION] Post-election risk
> The great irony is these strong election year performances come during periods of very poor long-term economic outcomes [59:40]. The speaker warns against going long in markets immediately after such an election year, as it could lead to a "mean reversion" or even a "retracement and decline" once the sugar high of stimulus wears off and [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | geopolitical holding patterns]] cease [01:00:20].

This perspective suggests that the current market push is likely a "sugar high" that could end in retracement, with the earliest potential for this being January [01:01:24]. However, such turns often take longer than expected, as markets tend to rally and build to "blow-off tops" before significant declines [01:01:40].# [[geopolitical_tensions_and_global_conflicts | Potential Geopolitical Risks and Global Conflicts]]

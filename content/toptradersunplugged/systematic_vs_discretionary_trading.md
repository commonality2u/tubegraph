Scott Billington, a veteran hedge fund manager, discusses the fundamental choice between [[systematic and discretionary trading approaches|discretionary and systematic trading]] methods, emphasizing the advantages of the latter based on his experience and research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. His philosophy aligns with Leonardo da Vinci's quote: "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, suggesting that a clear, definable strategy is superior to complex, opaque ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Defining Discretionary Trading

Discretionary trading is characterized by a trader bringing in various inputs and weighing them in a non-standard fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This means the weight given to different inputs can change each time, even if the same inputs or ratios are considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Ultimately, trade decisions are made based on this variable weighing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Billington argues that even if a trader has a mechanical model, but decides to override it, for example, seven times a year, those overrides are likely to occur during volatile periods with large outcomes, effectively making the model discretionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Challenges of Discretionary Trading

*   **Difficulty in Testing Efficacy:** A significant problem with discretionary trading is the inability to accurately estimate the effectiveness of a theory through historical modeling or backtesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. A discretionary theory might make perfect sense as a hypothesis, but there's no robust method to test its past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Limited Market Breadth:** It is challenging for a discretionary trader to be an expert across a wide variety of markets, such as the Yen and cotton simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Influence:** A primary concern is the difficulty, if not impossibility, of separating one's decision-making process from their current emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Personal events or recent trading performance (e.g., a losing streak versus strong profitable months) can heavily influence analytical judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Defining Systematic Trading

Systematic trading, in contrast, involves doing "the exact same thing every time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This approach aims for consistency and repeatability in every decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Billington's firm, Covenant Capital, operates on a [[rulebased trading strategies|rule-based trading strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Why Choose Systematic Trading?

Billington outlines three main reasons for choosing a [[systematic trading systems|systematic approach]]:

1.  **Testability and Efficacy:** A [[systematic trading strategies|systematic model's]] effectiveness can be estimated and verified through historical modeling and backtesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This allows traders to determine if their theory was accurate in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
2.  **Broad Market Applicability:** A systematic approach is much easier to apply across a wide variety of markets because the rules are consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
3.  **Elimination of Emotion:** A key advantage is the removal of emotions from the trading process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The systematic model ensures that decisions are repeatable and not influenced by the trader's personal emotional state or recent trading performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This means a decision made in June 2004 would be the same in December 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## [[Systematic trading vs expert intuition|Systematic Trading vs. Expert Intuition]]

Billington argues against the notion that more advanced algorithms developed by "an army of PhDs" are inherently better than simpler approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. He emphasizes robustness and the desire to line up all "facts" (like cost savings from longer holding periods) in one's favor before relying on empirically based models, which might not hold true in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

He notes that most trading is random, with an expected loss equivalent to costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Opinions about market movements based on news or events are either not predictive or already priced into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. For a systematic trader, the goal is not to predict where the market will go, but to identify signals worth taking risk on, knowing that certain trade characteristics (like long positions being inherently superior to shorts due to compounding) are mathematically factual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

## Evolution of a [[Philosophies of systematic trading|Systematic Trading]] Model

Billington's own journey into [[systematic trading and trend following strategies|systematic trend following]] began in the mid-90s, by manually backtesting models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. This manual process inherently limited curve-fitting, ensuring robustness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. An early critical insight was the high cost of frequent trading, leading to a focus on longer-term holding periods to minimize commissions and bid-ask spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

His model has undergone major changes, such as initially eliminating short trades and incorporating a volatility filter for long trades in early 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. This decision was based on the understanding that short trades are "bounded by zero" and offer less potential for "outlying large moves" compared to long trades, which benefit from compounding effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>. Short trades, however, have proven to be excellent diversifiers within a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. The model evolved to treat shorts and longs differently, aiming to minimize the inherent weakness of short trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

The firm runs the same systematic model on all markets, with every input being identical, emphasizing robustness over market-specific optimizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:59">[01:08:59]</a>. This avoids the "ultimate height of curve fitting" seen when traders use numerous different models with many parameters, each tailored to specific markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>.

For Scott, the specific technical indicator (e.g., moving averages or price breakout channels) used for entry/exit points "doesn't matter" because the core principles of systematic trading and risk management remain consistent across various simple indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:58">[01:14:58]</a>. The efficacy of a trade is more influenced by the time frame than the specific indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>.

## [[Technical analysis versus systematic trading|Technical Analysis Versus Systematic Trading]]

While systematic trading often utilizes technical analysis elements for signal generation, the underlying philosophy prioritizes robustness and statistical edges over predictive abilities. The focus is on executing a defined, testable method consistently, rather than interpreting market movements or predicting future price action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>.

The [[federal_reserve_policies_and_economic_impact | Federal Reserve]] (Fed) plays a core role in managing market volatility, with its job defined as smoothing the business cycle and dampening volatility on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, its current actions are creating complex dynamics in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## The Fed's "Selling Puts" and "Selling Calls" Metaphor

The Fed can influence markets by providing or removing liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This can be understood through the metaphor of "selling puts" and "selling calls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>:

*   **Selling Puts (Protection from Downside)**: The Fed provides liquidity to the market, for instance, by flooding it via Quantitative Easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a> or securing depositors as seen recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This backstops liquidity events on the tail, acting like a "put" that protects against significant market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. When the Fed sells puts, it generally lowers [[impact_of_macroeconomic_factors_on_volatility | volatility]] and can create a short-term bounce in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Dealers may buy these puts and consequently buy stock back, pushing the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Selling Calls (Curbing Upside)**: Simultaneously, the Fed removes liquidity by increasing interest rates, aiming to talk the market down and prevent a "wealth effect" that stimulates the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This acts like selling calls, limiting upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

The Fed is currently playing both sides of the market: selling far out-of-the-money puts while selling closer-to-the-money calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This strategy aims to bring the market down without triggering a liquidation event, which is a challenging balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The overall effect is a reduction of [[impact_of_macroeconomic_factors_on_volatility | volatility]] on both sides while still trying to lower the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Lagging Effects of Monetary Policy

[[impact_of_monetary_policy_on_markets | Monetary policy]] actions, particularly interest rate increases, move slowly through the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. There is a significant lag, especially on the majority of global assets beyond domestic equities, such as commercial real estate, venture capital, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

*   **Interest Rate Hikes**: Interest rates have risen significantly, but their full effects are still working through the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. For example, stock buybacks in Q1 were near record levels despite interest rates rising from zero to five percent throughout the previous year, but they are now starting to fall significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Housing starts also show projects initiated a year ago are only now breaking ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Stimulus**: Concurrently, significant fiscal stimulus (e.g., $10 trillion in the US) is still working its way into the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Direct stimulus, such as securing depositors or the Treasury General Account, provides immediate boosts to demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This creates a "Push-Pull" dynamic, where faster-moving short-term stimulus acts against slower, longer-term effects of rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

This lag means that while a "tidal wave" of consequences from past actions is approaching, short-term forces like current QE and reflexive market positioning (e.g., hedge funds being short) can lead to counter-cyclical moves, including potential "blow-off tops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Historically, market rallies can occur even when negative events are known in advance, due to positioning and immediate stimulus effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## Market Volatility and Cyclical vs. Secular Trends

[[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_global_markets | Central bank policies]] operate within both cyclical and secular trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For the last 40 years, markets have largely operated in a two-dimensional cycle, with the Fed able to easily stimulate and reinflate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. However, a new [[impact_of_government_policy_on_markets | countervailing force]] of [[inflation_trends_and_federal_reserve_policies | inflation]] and fiscal stimulus aimed at rebalancing inequality means the Fed has less control and the system is now "much more dimensional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Historically, the period of 1968-1982 saw three recessions and major pullbacks in inflation and Federal Reserve funds rates, but this did not alter the broader secular trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. These cyclical downturns can actually drive more fiscal policy and secular trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

[!NOTE] The current environment is seen as a cyclical downturn within a secular trend of rising populism and rebalancing inequality, driven by demographic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

## Impact on Asset Classes

The Fed's actions and the changing macroeconomic landscape influence different asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>:

*   **Equities**: While broad market equity [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | volatility]] (VIX) might appear low (lowest in two years as of April 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>, there have been dramatic internal moves between growth and value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. The "unpinning" of implied volatility, where Vol Supply starts to be released and dealers become short Vol, could lead to a rapid upward squeeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:01">[00:56:01]</a>. This means a period where [[impact_of_market_volatility_on_investment_returns | volatility]] explodes but initially to the upside, challenging traditional assumptions of negative correlation between VIX and the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.
*   **Bonds**: The 40-year secular decrease in interest rates created the 40-year boom in equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:18">[00:50:18]</a>. In a period of changing interest rates, bonds, currencies, and precious metals often become more significant areas for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:13">[00:51:13]</a>.
*   **Commodities**: Commodity strength, supported by factors like OPEC's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:17">[00:41:17]</a>, China's reopening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>, and a weakening dollar, is likely to remain sticky even in a local stagnation or recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>.

The Fed's actions aim to dampen volatility, but they may ultimately be perpetuating a longer inflationary picture by trying to control cyclical inflation in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>.

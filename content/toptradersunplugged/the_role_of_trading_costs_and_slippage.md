Trading costs and slippage are crucial factors that significantly impact a trader's profitability, especially over the long term. These costs are often overlooked but can erode potential gains, making it harder for even good strategies to succeed.

## The Inherent Conflict of Transaction Costs

Scott Billington of Covenant Capital Management realized an inherent conflict in the "transaction business" where he was paid on commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This realization stemmed from observing that a client who lost $109,000 in a year had actually paid $174,000 in commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. From this perspective, the client's entry and exit decisions were "frankly excellent," but they traded "way too much," turning a potentially successful strategy into a loss due to excessive costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This highlighted that if he couldn't trade profitably, he needed a different industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Market makers, for example, make significant income from those who want to take positions, indicating how much money is transferred from traders through transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## Defining Trading Costs

In a frictionless or costless world, the expected outcome of random trading would be to break even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Therefore, the expected loss from random trading is directly equivalent to the costs incurred, primarily commissions and, more significantly, bid-ask spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. These costs also encompass slippage, which can be thought of as a wider bid-ask spread in a fast market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

These costs are "fixed" per trade, meaning whether a trade is held for eight minutes or eight months, the bid-ask spread is just as wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The holding period has no impact on these fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## The "Trading Edge" and Costs

A "trading edge" is defined as a non-random entry and exit decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The amount by which a method needs to outperform randomness just to break even is equivalent to its costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This can be likened to the "house edge" in a casino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Since forecasting future price moves is "extraordinarily difficult," the goal is to make this hurdle as small as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Cost Implications for Different Timeframes
A shorter-term trading method will have more instances in a given time period and thus needs a larger "gross edge" to compensate for giving up more profit to costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Conversely, a longer-term method has a lower hurdle to clear due to lower aggregate costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Current Trading Costs

Even though trading costs are lower today than in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, they remain a significant factor. Covenant Capital Management closely tracks its costs, finding that they average about $35 per round turn, including rolls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

For a CTA executing 3,000 round turns per million dollars under management, this translates to $105,000 a year in costs, or about 11% of the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. If the best traders make 20% annually, 11% represents more than half of that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This highlights the substantial drag that costs can have on performance.

## Robustness Against Unknown Futures

The argument for minimizing costs is rooted in a mathematical fact, not empirical evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While models and backtests are empirically based and susceptible to "Black Swan" events or changes in market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, saving 5% a year in costs is not susceptible to a Black Swan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. In fact, trading less frequently and having wider trading parameters can mitigate the impact of massive gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

By lining up "facts" in one's favor before relying on empirical evidence, a trader can improve their odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Most trading is essentially random, with an expected loss equal to costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This means a trader needs to capture a "non-random price behavior" anomaly sufficient to cover these costs and then generate profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. A lower cost structure means less of an anomaly needs to be captured, providing more resilience if future market conditions are less favorable than past ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

> "What we need to worry about is what if it's still an anomaly, it's still a capturable persistent non-random price movement... but less than what we've seen in the past, yeah, can I still make money?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>

## Managing Risk Through Cost Control

Covenant Capital Management's initial approach to minimizing costs was to move to a longer time frame for trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. A study found that if a model switched to holding trades four times longer, 80% of the saved costs would flow directly into profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. This deliberate choice to minimize transaction costs is a key aspect of their [[risk_management_in_trading_strategies | risk management in trading strategies]] and overall philosophy, complementing their systematic approach to trading.

## The Impact of Increased Slippage in Trend Following

The concern that more managers becoming longer-term traders could lead to widespread "running for the exit" during trend reversals is addressed by observing the market impact. If this were happening, two key indicators would appear:
1.  **Dramatic increase in slippage:** Traders would experience worse execution prices than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>.
2.  **Decrease in winning percentage or truncation of average winners:** Trends would not last as long because small reversals would turn into big reversals, forcing exits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

Covenant Capital Management has not observed these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:56">[00:41:56]</a>. This suggests that while more people may be adopting longer-term strategies, the market is currently not experiencing systemic issues related to liquidity squeezes from large, simultaneous exits.

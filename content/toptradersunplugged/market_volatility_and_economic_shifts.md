The Systematic Investor Series, hosted by Niels Kostrop Larsen and Alan Dunn, offers insights into global markets through the lens of rules-based investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28"></a>. Recent discussions have focused on the [[market_volatility_and_volatility_strategies | volatility]] space and the choice between [[market_volatility_and_volatility_strategies | volatility]] or trend following strategies for portfolio protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43"></a>.

## October 2022 Market Overview

October 2022 was described as "another month for the history books" due to numerous significant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26"></a>.

Notable events included:
*   The short tenure of UK Prime Minister Liz Truss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30"></a>.
*   Significant declines in tech stock earnings: Meta/Facebook stock was down about 75% from its high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36"></a>. Amazon predicted its slowest-ever sales growth, with its stock falling as much as 21% in after-hours trading, wiping off approximately $143 billion in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44"></a>.
*   Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09"></a>.

### Monetary Policy and Macroeconomic Factors

A key area of focus for [[market_trends_and_macroeconomic_factors | market trends and macroeconomic factors]] was the aggressive stance of central banks:
*   U.S. mortgage rates topped 7% for the first time in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15"></a>.
*   Federal Reserve officials maintained a hawkish stance, setting the stage for [[market_volatility_and_interest_rates | interest rates]] to reach 5% by March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23"></a>.
*   Economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted that these policies would lead the U.S. and global economies into recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36"></a>.
*   The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was expected to announce a 75 basis point rate hike in November, followed by 50 basis points in December, and 25 basis points in the subsequent two meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45"></a>.
*   The U.S. export ban of microchips to China was also identified as a significant development to watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57"></a>.

### Market Responses and Volatility

October also saw "energetic bear market rallies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07"></a>, indicating [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility in financial markets]]:
*   A choppy recovery rally in risk assets was observed since mid-month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41"></a>.
*   The Consumer Price Index (CPI) release in mid-October coincided with a market bottom, demonstrating a positive reaction to what seemed like bad news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47"></a>.
*   Concerns were raised about decreasing liquidity in the treasury market, leading to more extreme moves in bond yields and wider bid-offer spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29"></a>. Janet Yellen, Treasury Secretary, also expressed concerns about liquidity in the treasury market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03"></a>.
*   The market saw a "story of two tales" with the first three weeks of October following established trend-following themes, leading to significant declines in long bonds and currencies against the U.S. dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20"></a>.
*   A Wall Street Journal article, seen as a leak from the Fed, suggested a potential pause or slowdown in rate hikes, which ignited a rally in assets like bonds (up 5 big points from low, though still down 23 big points since July) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42"></a>.
*   Equities rallied about 10% from their October lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19"></a>.
*   Equity markets are now more volatile than trend following returns on a monthly basis, experiencing 6-7% up and down moves this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26"></a>.
*   Energy markets were also interesting, with U.S. natural gas down about 15% for the month and Dutch natural gas down 66% from its late August peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44"></a>.
*   The World Government Bond Index was down 10 basis points in October, the first time in a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36"></a>.

### Macro Resilience in Asset Allocation

A paper by analysts at GIC (Singapore's sovereign wealth fund) in conjunction with MSCI proposed a new framework for building balanced portfolios for the long run, focusing on macro resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00"></a>. This framework aims to construct portfolios based on how assets respond to different macro environments and risks, moving away from backward-looking measures like Sharp ratio optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48"></a>.

The paper highlights two key shifts:
1.  The rise of private assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37"></a>.
2.  A changed macro environment with much more macro uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41"></a>.

It discusses five key longer-term risks:
*   Historically, demand shocks dominated markets (e.g., lower growth, lower rates, negative correlation between bonds and equities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31"></a>.
*   More recently, supply shocks (e.g., COVID-19, war in Ukraine) have become prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06"></a>.
*   Policy shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23"></a>.
*   Trend growth shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26"></a>.
*   Real rate shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26"></a>.

The paper suggests moving away from the traditional 60/40 portfolio, advocating for allocations to private equity and real estate, and more to TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53"></a>. However, it notably did not include an allocation to trend following or managed futures strategies, which is curious given their role in portfolio robustness and adaptability to different shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08"></a>.

## Unpredictable Future and the New Era

The idea that the future is unpredictable is a recurring theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00"></a>. Niels Kostrop Larsen believes in the existence of cycles (business cycles, interest rate cycles) and highlights the 40-year interest rate cycle, which saw rates peak in 1981 and hit a low in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49"></a>.

A McKinsey Global Institute report, "On the Cusp of a New Era," argues that the world is transitioning from a distinct economic and market period (1989-2019, the "era of markets") into a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51"></a>. This shift is attributed to "earthquakes" like COVID-19, the war in Ukraine, rising geopolitical risks, and energy scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06"></a>. This aligns with Ray Dalio's concept of market paradigms, where predominant ideologies lead to perceived success and stability, eventually laying the groundwork for disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01"></a>.

Christine Lagarde's (ECB) remarks at Jackson Hole, stating a shift from "the great moderation to the great [[volatility_and_market_dynamics | volatility]]", underscore this sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:23"></a>. This new era is characterized by unpredictable inflation, driving markets in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50"></a>. This makes fundamentally driven [[investing_during_economic_shifts | investing during economic shifts]] incredibly difficult, if not impossible, suggesting that rules-based strategies might have an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:21"></a>.

### Unforeseen Consequences of Quantitative Easing (QE)

The current market environment is witnessing the playing out of unforeseen consequences of Quantitative Easing (QE) as central banks withdraw stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06"></a>. This was forewarned by Bill White in his 2012 paper, "Ultra Easy Monetary Policy and the Unintended Consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:49"></a>.

Recent examples of these consequences include:
*   Extreme [[volatility_in_financial_markets | volatility]] in UK Gilts and TIPS markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11"></a>.
*   Central banks having to intervene more frequently, such as the Bank of Japan intervening in dollar-yen and reports of Chinese banks selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49"></a>.
*   The J.P. Morgan market liquidity index being at its lowest levels in years, indicating a drought of liquidity in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14"></a>.

These events align with the concept of markets and economies as "complex adaptive systems" that are inherently unstable, often reaching "tipping points" or "thresholds" where markets can go parabolic and reinforce trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42"></a>. Futures markets generally remain the most liquid markets during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50"></a>.

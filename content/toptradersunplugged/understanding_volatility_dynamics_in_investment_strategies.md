## Introduction to [[Volatility and Market Dynamics]]

The core premise of effective [[investment_strategies_for_volatility]] is to construct portfolios based on what is unknown, ensuring they perform optimally in extreme market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This approach prioritizes building resilience for the unexpected rather than predicting known outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It's crucial to understand that past investment performance does not guarantee or infer future results, and all [[investment_strategies_for_volatility]] carry significant risks of financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The year 2022 highlighted a significant shift, with investors losing more in their bond portfolios than in their stock portfolios, disrupting the expected balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This unusual scenario marked a departure from the "carry regime" enjoyed for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Critique of Traditional Portfolio Models

### The Flawed 60/40 Portfolio
The traditional 60/40 optimized portfolio model is fundamentally flawed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. The 40% bond allocation often fails to participate effectively in the market and, more critically, may not provide sufficient, or any, protection to the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

The negative correlation between bonds and stocks, a cornerstone of this model, was artificially generated from the "Greenspan put era" onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This artificial correlation emerged because central banks would cut interest rates when asset prices fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While this created a multi-decade benefit, once interest rates reached zero, this bond allocation became "risk additive" rather than risk mitigating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Quantitative Easing (QE) further exacerbated this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. As early as December 2020, it was argued that "inflation is upon us, 60/40 is dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### The "Sharp World" Problem
Many large institutional investors, including pension funds, struggled to anticipate the risks posed by zero or negative interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. For example, Denmark's largest pension fund, ATP, reported a 47% loss of its strategic reserve capital in the first three quarters of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

This failure is attributed to the "Sharp World" mathematics underlying traditional finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This framework, encompassing concepts like random walk, Gaussian normal distribution, efficient market hypothesis, modern portfolio theory, and Capital Asset Pricing Model, has been described as a "fraud" that enriched financial fiduciaries at the expense of capital owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It allowed governments worldwide to push debt-to-GDP ratios beyond 100% by duping savers into holding debt through pension funds, insurance companies, and banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The "Sharp World" framework assumes:
*   Historical [[volatility in financial markets]] and correlations remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Geometric compounding paths are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Tails are never fat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   Leverage is not risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Frequency matters more than magnitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   Ensemble averages dominate time averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## The Role of Central Banks and Fragility

Central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed), have significantly influenced market correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Their role as a "ten thousand pound gorilla" has controlled an otherwise non-linear system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Fragility in the System
Market fragility is defined by "uncapitalized tails" in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis exemplified this, where flaws in regulatory structures (e.g., Basel I) allowed financial institutions to create complex, highly leveraged products like AAA super-senior tranches of subprime CDOs, which were paradoxically deemed zero risk-weighted assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. A small change in correlation of house prices wiped out global banking capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Currently, this uncapitalized risk resides in the insufficient capital supporting the 40% bond allocation in modern versions of the 60/40 portfolio, such as LDI (Liability-Driven Investment) and risk parity strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Because this 40% was considered risk-reducing, less capital was held against the 60%, leaving portfolios vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Central banks are now navigating a tightrope: they need to raise rates to restore price stability without triggering a collapse in leveraged fixed-income savings pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Their asymmetric approach—acting quickly to slash rates but slowly to raise them—has led them to fall behind the inflation curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. The Fed has shown some understanding of this problem, actively keeping the yield curve as inverted as possible to protect fixed-income markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

## [[Volatility in Trading Strategies]] and Liquidity

[[Volatility in financial markets]] and liquidity are intrinsically linked, often described as "cousins" or two sides of the same coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Decreased liquidity, particularly in top-of-book futures and market depth in options, has been observed dramatically in 2022 as the Fed raised interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

Some [[investment_strategies_for_volatility]] focus on being "value investors in [[volatility in financial markets]]" or "stores of highly convex liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This means seeking out areas where uncapitalized tails exist, so that when markets move into these extremes, liquidity becomes highly desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

In 2022, interest rate [[volatility in financial markets]] was a prime area where market participants, often unknowingly, supplied [[volatility in financial markets]] through structured products like callable notes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. These instruments, designed to provide yield enhancement, created a surge in [[volatility in financial markets]] supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The pain of dealers hedging these products, along with unrealized losses held by end-investors (e.g., Taiwanese insurance companies, German pension funds), indicates a significant problem with liquidity in the interest rate space that is yet to fully materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

### Liquidity and Dealer Positioning
Over shorter timeframes (months to a year), dealer positioning is a strong negative predictor for [[volatility in financial markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. Low trading volume often correlates with worse performance for [[volatility in financial markets]] in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. This reflexive effect means that the act of insuring against market movements (buying/selling volatility) itself influences the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. This can lead to over-leverage and periods of [[volatility in financial markets]] compression, but ultimately result in larger spikes when conditions reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

For long-volatility managers, understanding the supply and demand for [[volatility in financial markets]], particularly in complex structured product markets and across different asset classes globally, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. This often means being the "garbage collectors of [[volatility in financial markets]]", buying when others are desperate to sell at extremely low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

A historical example is the 2008 Korean FX [[volatility in financial markets]] surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. While the VIX (S&P 500 implied volatility) went up 3x, Korean FX [[volatility in financial markets]] rose 12x due to structured product dynamics, specifically KIKO (knock-in, knock-out) options sold by Korean exporters to earn enhanced yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. These exporters, who should have been sellers of dollars in a rising dollar environment, became aggressive buyers as their hedges unwound, causing the market to explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Similarly, UK pension funds became forced panic sellers of gilts when yields rose, contrary to expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.

## Forecasting vs. Resilience: Knowing What You Don't Know

A core philosophy for managing [[volatility in financial markets]] is the "pointlessness of forecasting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:43">[00:46:43]</a>. The focus is not on predicting future behavior or market direction (neither bearish nor bullish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. Instead, the emphasis is on identifying "asymmetry potential"—situations where something is priced as if it "can't happen," and someone is willing to sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

The **[[Impact of Market Volatility on Investment Returns]]** is largely driven by outliers. Over a 40-year period, the 10 best months in the S&P 500 contribute about 30% of the long-term compounded return, while the 10 worst months contribute about minus 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. This highlights that "what happens in those two percentile tails" (outside two standard deviations) is what truly drives return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>.

Drawing on Mandelbrot's concept, it's magnitude, not frequency, that matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:06">[00:49:06]</a>. This is analogous to a football match where the ball spends 96% of the time in the middle of the pitch, but only the 2% in the penalty boxes truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>. Therefore, portfolios should be constructed to perform best in the extremes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Analogy: Race Car Brakes
> An effective [[investment_strategies_for_volatility]] that focuses on [[volatility in financial markets]] can be compared to the brakes of a Formula One race car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>. The brakes don't make money directly, but they allow the car (the core portfolio) to drive faster and more confidently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. The cost of good brakes (long convexity) is justified by the ability to generate higher compounded returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

## [[Volatility and Strategies in 2022]] and Beyond

In 2022, [[volatility in financial markets]] generally became more expensive, making long-volatility strategies harder to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. However, opportunities still exist in markets where central banks continue to suppress [[volatility in financial markets]] and provide liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:35">[00:39:35]</a>.

### Current Opportunities
*   **Japan:** The Bank of Japan maintains an interest rate peg at 25 basis points for 10-year JGBs, actively suppressing [[volatility in financial markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. This creates a uniquely stable environment for structured products, making Japanese interest rate [[volatility in financial markets]] particularly cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. The Bank of Japan has even owned over 100% of certain on-the-run bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.
*   **China:** The Chinese central bank actively suppresses currency [[volatility in financial markets]], which in turn suppresses interest rate [[volatility in financial markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>. State-related institutions are incentivized to buy bonds, effectively conducting informal QE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. These two countries are currently not actively fighting inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Europe:** Despite recent movements, the European Central Bank (ECB) is not shrinking its balance sheet and continues to provide QE through programs like TPI (Transmission Protection Instrument) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. Policy rates remain low even with skyrocketing inflation, leading to significant yield curve inversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:49">[01:02:49]</a>. This presents opportunities for those willing to venture further out on [[volatility in financial markets]] surfaces in rates and FX space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Credit Markets:** Credit in some markets is also seen as a potential area of opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:12">[01:10:12]</a>.

Equity [[volatility in financial markets]], particularly in major markets like S&P and VIX, is generally not seen as cheap due to the abundance of experts and players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>. However, even here, skew (the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money puts and calls) has become less expensive than in previous years, warranting some attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.

### Outrageous Predictions for the Future
*   **Capital Controls:** The most significant, yet unforeseen, development could be the implementation of capital controls globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:19">[01:14:19]</a>. This would involve the enforced recycling of domestic savings into sovereign bond markets, preventing national savings from funding foreign debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:25">[01:14:25]</a>. Countries like Japan, the UK, and Europe, where capital controls were once unthinkable, may adopt them, while China will likely tighten existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>.
*   **Rising 10-Year Yields:** The 10-year bond yield could rise above 8% within a two-year horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. As the Fed remains constrained and long-term inflation expectations increase even during a recession, this "steepener trade" could become a significant play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:49">[01:16:49]</a>.
*   **Price Controls:** Price controls are a form of "hidden fiscal stimulus" that politically become unavoidable when inflation puts politicians in a difficult spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. Historically, leaders like Nixon implemented such policies despite being free-market advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:25">[01:17:25]</a>. If central banks lack the monetary policy will to fully unwind QE, price controls could exacerbate long-term structural inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:28">[01:18:28]</a>.

## The Role of Interest Rates and Bonds

A recession is considered a "good outcome" because it would lead people to buy bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, if a recession is continually avoided and [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rates]] are cut too early, people will not buy bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This is partly because previous bond buyers, who purchased them when prices were "wrong" due to regulation and incentives for annual accrued income, have reached their capacity and are "full" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Key Market Takeaways from the Past Year

### Japan's Monetary Policy and Yen Carry Trade
Japan's Bank of Japan (BOJ) played a key role in the past year, with its first interest rate hikes in decades occurring in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This triggered an unwind of the Yen carry trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. A pivot by Jerome Powell at Jackson Hole regarding rate cuts further triggered a Yen carry unwind, causing a shock across markets, particularly Japanese stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Japanese stocks experienced a significant [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] day, falling 12% to a circuit breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Convexity in FX Space
A significant development in 2024 was the cheapness of convexity in the FX (Foreign Exchange) space, likened to what 2021 was for [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rate]] convexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This year has seen a "lively start" in FX [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]], with many assets moving aggressively from extreme lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### S&P Skew and Call Selling
The S&P 500 (S&P) has seen a proliferation of call selling, either to fund puts or as covered call writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This has impacted skew and spot [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] correlation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Historical Parallels
Current market dynamics show similarities to the 1995-1999 period, where US equity markets and the dollar rose sharply, tearing apart the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Key parallels include:
*   Dollar strength following the Trump election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Fed rate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   Equity [[market_volatility_and_economic_shifts | market strength]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Higher "longer" bond yields, which also occurred after Fed rate cuts in 1995-1996 and 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   The S&P being up over 20% for two consecutive years, a rarity, with 1995-1999 being an exception where it rose over 20% for five consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## The August 2024 Event: A Case Study in [[Volatility in financial markets | Volatility]]

### Triggers and Market Reaction
In August, [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] structures were impacted, especially in Japanese equities and Nikkei index products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. A key event was the "gamma-geddon" in the first week of August, where single-day gamma had a significant payoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This was not primarily a Vega event, as one-year Vega hardly budged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Gamma vs. Vega Performance
While gamma paid off significantly in Nikkei, it didn't in the S&P <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. In the US market, local gamma had a historically poor performance relative to Vega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This was due to September through December [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] and skew being dramatically undersupplied, while August skew and [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] were overwhelmingly oversupplied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. The market was caught by surprise, leading to a "three or four standard deviation move" in the gamma-Vega relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Global Correlations and Deleveraging
The August event was influenced by the unwind of the Yen carry trade, triggering correlations in NASDAQ and growth-versus-value leveraged structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This deleveraging by multi-strat hedge funds was a key driver, as they unwound initial risks after chasing markets to the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This correlation issue is expected to continue impacting markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Japan's Continued Relevance
Japan's central bank actions continue to be a focus. Despite some assuming no rate hike, a speech by Deputy Governor Uchida suggests a hike may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. The concept of negative real rates not being appropriate if deflation risks are behind us implies "many, many more hikes to come" for Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Cross-Market Dynamics
The S&P and theoretical VIX moves were significantly larger in Asia time, indicating a shift in market drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. This is part of a broader "cross-ocean" dynamic where different forces are at play in different regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

## Structural Challenges and Market Outlook

### The Problem with Correlation
A key theme is the breakdown of correlations that people rely on for [[market_volatility_and_economic_shifts | diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>. [[Impact of market volatility on investment returns | Risk parity strategies]] have consistently underperformed for the past 5-15 years due to these correlation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

> "True risk is your divergence from your compounding path... It's not annual [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] of returns; it's how far behind what people need me to make for their retirement in 30 years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>

The constant disappointment in correlation forces market participants to reduce risk, leading to left-skewed dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. This issue is hardcoded into financial regulations (e.g., Basel 3, IAS 19, Solvency 2) and modern portfolio theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

### The Bond Market's Predicament
The bond market faces a significant challenge: "who's going to own the bonds" now that their correlation and [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] benefits as risk mitigants for financial institutions are gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>. Many institutions are overloaded with bonds bought with "infinite leverage at ridiculous levels" and hold huge unrealized losses because they don't market-to-market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

If central banks cut [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rates]] too early to avoid a recession, people will not buy bonds, exacerbating the supply issue (e.g., $10 trillion in US refinancing this year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:44">[00:42:44]</a>. The assumption that the 10-year yield won't go above 5.5% is common despite recent rapid movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>.

### Positioning and Leverage
Market positioning is seen as the only thing that matters, with everything else being "gaming a flawed risk or prediction system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. This positioning "simply comes down to leverage," which makes returns left-tail skewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Forest Fire Analogy
> [[Volatility and Market Dynamics | The risk is not the lightning strike or the wind; the risk is the dry brush on the ground]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>. Similarly, in markets, risk is not what might happen in the future, but what is on the balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:24">[01:10:24]</a>. This "dry brush" represents leverage, where seemingly independent assets become highly correlated when enough "dry brush" (leverage) accumulates between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:19">[01:13:19]</a>.

### Structural Product Issuance
The growth of structured products, particularly in the US, is a significant [[volatility and market mechanics | market mechanics]] factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. Global structured product issuance has doubled from $500 billion to $1 trillion per year, primarily in the US and tied to the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This phenomenon is driven by financial repression and mercantilist policies, especially in Asia, where interest rates were kept too low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:56">[01:18:56]</a>.

The biggest structured product in history is callable bonds, which have created massive unrealized losses and hidden leverage, particularly for Korean pension funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:44">[01:19:44]</a>. The belief in stability and historically low [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] in FX has made it a large market for structured products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:59">[01:20:59]</a>.

### Future [[Market volatility and economic shifts | Market Dynamics]]
The current environment suggests a shift from central bank dominance to a period of less Federal Reserve control and greater [[volatility and market mechanics | market mechanics]] influencing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. This could lead to a "Bretton Woods type big" shift in the global monetary system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:41">[01:27:41]</a>. The US, as the keeper of the global reserve currency, and China, its main competitor, are putting pressure on the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.

The Fed's upcoming framework review might remove average inflation targeting and potentially redefine Quantitative Easing (QE) as an emergency tool rather than a stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>. However, there is skepticism that the Fed would relinquish control of QE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:51">[01:06:51]</a>. The current period is similar to the late 90s but with a much bigger structural inflation issue and less Fed control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>.

This environment presents "incredible opportunities" for convexity in rates and FX markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Areas like FX and [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rate]] [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]] are expected to continue performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Equity [[volatility in financial markets | volatility]], where hedging is concentrated, may underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:17">[01:25:17]</a>.

The ongoing [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rate]] increases, coupled with high debt-to-GDP ratios, suggest that countries cannot handle 7-10% yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:30">[01:28:30]</a>. This could force a crisis before an amicable reset of the monetary system, leading to abrupt and conflict-driven unwinds of imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:08">[01:27:08]</a>.

The ultimate power of government to dictate behavior is a significant concern when considering assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This perspective stems from the idea that if an asset, such as Bitcoin, becomes large enough to challenge the government's ability to control its own currency, it could face severe repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Government's Power to Control Currency

An anecdote highlights the extent of government power:
> "You don't understand, I don't care what happens to Skilling and all these boys, I just want them to end up in a big dark hole with a boy called Bubba who calls them Shirley." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

This statement, made by a senator during discussions about Enron's collapse, underscored the government's power to dictate behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This power extends to currency control, where governments can implement policies that impact asset holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Bitcoin as a Potential Threat to Government Control

While Bitcoin might be seen as a "great trade" or a "high beta" asset, potentially serving as a [[comparison_of_bitcoin_and_gold_market_cap | store of value]] or precious metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, its true test lies in its challenge to governmental monetary authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> The day that Bitcoin ever becomes a big enough thing that it challenges the ability of government to control their own currency is the day that you are presented with the option of handing your Bitcoin over in the same way that you did with gold in the 1930s or trying to keep hold of it and if you're caught ending up in a big dark hole with a bloke called Bubba who calls you Shirley. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

Governments and [[role_of_central_banks_in_influencing_markets | central banks]] perceive Bitcoin as a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. Instances like Facebook's attempt with its own cryptocurrency and actions by the Chinese government illustrate this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>.

If caught, individuals might face confiscation or significant trouble, raising questions about the ability to spend such assets freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.

## Alternatives to Bitcoin for Wealth Preservation

Given these concerns, some advise against Bitcoin as a long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. Instead, alternatives like precious metals are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. These are considered less likely to be confiscated, particularly in an environment where the dollar weakens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Gold and silver, especially silver, are favored as protections against a collapsing dollar and as inflation plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>.

> [Precious metals] are protections against this collapse of the dollar and I do like silver because generally it will outperform in a more inflationary stroke reflationary environment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>

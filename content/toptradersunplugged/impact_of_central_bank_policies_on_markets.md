Central banks play a significant [[role_of_central_banks_in_influencing_markets | role in influencing markets]] through their policies, often leading to both intended and unforeseen consequences. Recent observations highlight a shift in market dynamics influenced by these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Current Monetary Policy Stance and Market Expectations
As of late October, Fed officials are maintaining a "resolute hawkish stance" ahead of their upcoming meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This position lays the groundwork for interest rates to potentially reach 5% by March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg anticipate that this will lead the U.S. and global economies into some form of recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

Specific expectations for Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) actions include:
*   A 75 basis point rate hike in Wednesday's meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   A 50 basis point hike in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   A 25 basis point hike in each of the subsequent two meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Rumors, specifically an article in the Wall Street Journal (a preferred way for the Fed to leak information), suggested that the Fed is considering slowing down their rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This suggestion is believed to have ignited a recent rally in assets like bonds, which saw a 5 big point gain from their low, although they remain down 23 big points since July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Currencies against the dollar also rallied, and equities were up about 10% from their October lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Historical Context and Market Regimes
Historically, markets and economies have been dominated by demand shocks, where weaker growth outlooks led to lower rates by policymakers, supporting a negative correlation between bonds and equities (equities down, bonds up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. However, recent times have seen more supply shocks, such as those caused by COVID-19 and the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. If supply shocks become more prevalent, their impact on markets will differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

There is a growing sentiment that the global economy is transitioning into a new era, moving away from a period of disinflationary trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>. This shift is characterized by increased macro uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>. Some economists and market observers, including Schnabel from the ECB, suggest a move from the "great moderation to the great volatility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>.

## Unforeseen Consequences of Quantitative Easing (QE)
The withdrawal of central bank stimulus, particularly [[impact_of_monetary_policy_and_qe_on_markets | Quantitative Easing (QE)]], is leading to unforeseen consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:40">[00:52:40]</a>. This is evident in:
*   Extreme volatility in UK Gilts and TIPS markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   Central banks intervening to manage market stability:
    *   Bank of Japan intervening in dollar-yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
    *   Chinese local banks selling dollars (possibly indicating People's Bank of China intervention) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.
    *   Janet Yellen expressing concerns about liquidity in the treasury market, noting larger moves and wider bid-offer spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>.

A JP market index of market liquidity has reached its lowest levels in years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. The current environment, where markets are experiencing volatile shifts and unpredictable inflation, highlights the challenges of fundamentally driven investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

## Expert Perspectives on Central Bank Models and Market Dynamics
Bill White, an economist who has worked at the OECD, Bank of England, Bank of Canada, and the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), has warned that central banks are using the "wrong models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. In 2007, he warned about leverage in the system and the risk of a financial crisis in a BIS annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.

White's core philosophy emphasizes that markets and the economy are [[complex_adaptive_systems | complex adaptive systems]] that are inherently unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>. He views the "hubris" of central bankers, who believe they have solved and understand these systems, as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:16">[00:51:16]</a>. This perspective aligns with the recent admission by the Fed that they "don't actually understand inflation very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>.

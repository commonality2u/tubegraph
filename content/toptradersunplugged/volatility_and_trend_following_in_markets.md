Systematic [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] aims to capture profits from market trends by applying a set of rules with discipline and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>. This approach is rooted in the belief that markets are not entirely random and that trends can be identified and exploited. Chris Cruden, a veteran hedge fund manager, emphasizes that success in this business comes from "showing up" consistently, which means avoiding ruin through careful [[Risk Management in Trend Following | risk management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>.

## The Role of Volatility

[[Volatility in trading strategies | Volatility]] plays a critical role in [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] strategies. Generally, low [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] tends to initiate a trend, while high [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] tends to terminate a trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:47">[00:56:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>.

### Impact on Trend Following Strategy

For a systematic [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] program like Kintyre, which focuses on currencies, a key determinant for entering and exiting trades is [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>. All trades are made "risk equivalent" at the time of instigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:34">[00:56:34]</a>, meaning that if one trade was known to be inherently "better" than another, the system would allocate more to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. This equal risk weighting at the outset reflects a non-predictive approach to markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.

The system uses trailing stops based on time and [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] to manage positions and protect capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:29">[00:57:29]</a>. This means that an increase in [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] within a particular trade is often the trigger for an exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

### Leverage and Risk Management

Maintaining low leverage is crucial for [[Risk Management in Trend Following | risk management]] and long-term survival in the trading business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. The firm operates with leverage ranging from 1:1 to 3:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:54">[00:57:54]</a>. This low gearing allows the strategy to achieve a standard deviation similar to the [[Volatility in the SP500 and market trends | S&P 500]], but with potentially higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. The philosophy, as articulated by David Harding, is that one "always makes money in this business if you don't go broke first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>. Leverage is identified as the primary factor that can lead to financial ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:11">[00:58:11]</a>.

## Market Conditions and Volatility Trends

### Challenges in Low Volatility Environments

The environment for currency programs has not been favorable in recent years, primarily due to exceptionally low [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>. This low [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] has resulted in the system being in all 16 currency trades most of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>. The average holding period for winning trades has significantly dropped, matching that of losing trades (around six days), a phenomenon described as the "statistical definition of the [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend follower's]] nightmare" or being "whipsawed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:41">[01:07:41]</a>.

### Anticipated Return of Volatility

Despite recent challenges, there is an anticipation for a return of [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>, which would be very positive for genuine [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend followers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. Observations suggest that [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] doesn't rise gradually, it "jumps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:33">[00:43:33]</a>. Some managers, who have altered their systems to fit the current low-[[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] environment, may find themselves "caught out" when the environment changes rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

Recent signs, such as the system being taken out of some trades, indicate that [[Volatility in trading strategies | volatility]] is slowly returning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:47">[01:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. This shift is seen as a positive development, making the environment more amenable to a [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.

### Central Bank Intervention and Future Volatility

While central bank actions and tools employed in recent years may seem "new," they are not considered sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:58">[00:44:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>. Observations show that central bank intervention in currency markets hasn't been particularly successful in the long term; trends tend to resume after a temporary pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. The belief is that due to these interventions, the future environment for currency markets will become even more favorable for [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>, as authorities are "running out of ammunition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:31">[00:47:31]</a>. This suggests that the extraordinary measures taken have increased the risk of the very outcomes they sought to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.

## Simplistic Approach to Trading

The Kintyre program uses simple, probability-based algorithms, with each of the 16 currency crosses having its own algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:49">[00:59:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. These algorithms are sets of rules, and the firm prides itself on adhering strictly to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. The core philosophy is to remove human emotion and ego from trading decisions, which are seen as major reasons for financial loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

Cruden views trading as a relatively simple business, where daily profits or losses are clearly quantifiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. He cautions against "perceived cleverness" in the industry, advocating for simplicity in design to avoid unnecessary complexity and potential breakdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.

[[Market volatility and volatility strategies | Market volatility and volatility strategies]] are integral to understanding and executing [[Trend Following in Various Markets | trend following]]. The firm's approach remains consistent, anticipating that market dynamics will eventually realign to create favorable conditions for their systematic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:55">[00:45:55]</a>. This aligns with the broader [[Correlation between trend following and market conditions | correlation between trend following and market conditions]], where periods of sustained trends often follow or precede periods of reduced volatility or market disequilibrium.

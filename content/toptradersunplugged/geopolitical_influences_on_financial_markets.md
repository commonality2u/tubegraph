[[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | Geopolitical factors]] increasingly influence financial markets, expanding the scope of "Global Macro" beyond traditional U.S. and European equities, rates, credits, commodities, and FX [00:00:16]. Investors must become more acquainted with looking at the world more broadly, as it extends beyond just the U.S. and Europe [00:00:31]. The world is becoming more bipolar, with Western powers seeking alignment, while emerging economies like Brazil openly question the dominance of the U.S. dollar and advocate for alternative currencies [01:14:45].

## Shift Towards Deglobalization
A significant [[geopolitical_and_macroeconomic_factors_influencing_markets | macroeconomic factor]] influencing current markets is the trend of deglobalization [00:10:09]. This shift is influenced by reasons similar to those seen in 1965, including increased fiscal spending, resource scarcity, protectionism, and the onset of [[geopolitical_impacts_on_global_markets | Cold War-like tensions]] [00:10:24]. The ability to export labor to countries like China is diminishing, and constraining labor supply to domestic borders will inherently increase inflation [00:11:18].

## Structural Inflation and Supply Chains
There is a notable probability that inflation will be structurally higher over the next 20 years compared to the last two decades [00:15:11]. This is partly due to global supply chains proving to be less resilient to various problems [00:15:29]. Businesses are increasingly considering onshoring, which means paying more for labor within their own country's boundaries [00:15:53]. The availability of cheap labor from regions like China is expected to shrink significantly over the next 20-30 years, removing a key deflationary force that characterized recent decades [00:08:56].

## Impact on the U.S. Dollar
The role of the U.S. dollar in a world influenced by [[geopolitics and global financial systems | geopolitical shifts]] is complex [01:03:59]. While some argue for the dollar's decline, it continues to hold an "exorbitant privilege" [01:04:49]. The U.S. remains the strongest and largest economy, with a decentralized rule of law, making it a perceived safe haven for money compared to autocratic regimes [01:04:11].

However, the dollar's role as the denominator for most global trade and FX transactions places a significant burden on the U.S. to provide liquid, deep, and ever-increasing markets for recycling these dollars [01:05:25]. Alternatives like Europe (lacking a large AAA market), Japan (central bank holding 60% of its market), or China and Russia (concerns over rule of law and money lock-up) cannot easily fulfill this role [01:06:14]. Furthermore, the transition away from a system with $12 trillion in dollar-denominated liabilities held by entities outside the U.S. would be chaotic and messy [01:07:15].

## Influence on Commodity Markets
[[geopolitical_factors_influencing_commodity_markets | Geopolitical factors]] also profoundly impact [[geopolitical_influences_on_energy_markets | commodity markets]] [01:09:02]. During periods of inflation, especially when accompanied by global conflict, other entities (like OPEC) begin to assert their influence and "flex their muscles" [01:09:21]. This is akin to the 1960s and 1970s, where events like the OPEC crisis were deeply connected to inflationary pushes and global conflict [01:09:56].

Commodities, particularly industrial commodities, are expected to play a more important role in macro portfolios going forward [01:12:16]. They tend to perform well in periods of high inflation volatility and rapidly increasing inflation momentum, providing diversification when traditional asset classes struggle [01:11:42]. This suggests a structural shift where these commodities will be underpinned by the actions of powerful entities, potentially reducing their volatility [01:10:47].

## Specific Regional Considerations
*   **Japan:** As the world's largest exporter of capital, Japanese real money investors are risk-averse and process-driven [01:47:05]. During periods of uncertainty, they tend to reduce risk, historically benefiting the Yen [01:48:26]. Coupled with recent wage growth and services inflation (4%) for the first time in 30 years, Japan faces potential inflationary pressures [01:49:00]. Any marginal change in monetary policy from the new Bank of Japan governor could lead to higher domestic interest rates, making repatriating cash more attractive [01:49:34]. The Japanese Yen could offer an asymmetric trade with potential tailwinds from domestic inflation and policy shifts, especially if the global economy slows down [01:50:29].
*   **Europe:** While European banks are subject to tighter regulation regarding interest rate risk (e.g., supervisory outlier test), they are more exposed to commercial real estate [00:31:36]. Years of negative interest rates forced European banks, pension funds, and asset managers to seek returns by taking on risk in real estate and leveraged real estate securities [00:33:41]. With European commercial real estate prices already experiencing severe drawdowns due to structural problems (e.g., office vacancies), this presents a potential credit problem that central banks cannot easily backstop, unlike a liquidity crisis [00:34:24].
*   **Emerging Markets and Carry Trades:** The resurgence of carry trades in currencies like the Brazilian Real, Mexican Peso, Polish Zloty, and Hungarian Forint suggests an investor mindset where these markets are perceived as safe havens with good carry [00:52:23]. However, this could be extreme, given the historical precedent of Emerging Market crises following interest rate hiking cycles [00:53:57]. This represents a building pressure that could eventually lead to "Minsky moments" where things break [00:54:18].

## Conclusion
The ongoing [[impact_of_geopolitical_events_on_global_markets | geopolitical shifts]] and [[effect_of_global_geopolitical_tensions_on_markets | global conflicts]] are ushering in a period of increased dimensionality in markets, moving away from a simpler, two-dimensional cyclical world [01:08:52]. Populist trends, tied to younger generations and driven by fiscal policy, foster nationalism and global conflict [01:16:20]. This macro turn from monetary to fiscal dominance and from capitalism to populism creates immense and asymmetric opportunities for investors who can navigate these structural changes [01:17:25].

This article details two major campaigns initiated by Mao Zedong after the establishment of the People's Republic of China: the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, based on information presented in the podcast.

## The Great Leap Forward (1958-1962)

The Great Leap Forward was an economic and social campaign by the Communist Party of China (CPC) under Mao Zedong's leadership.

### Policies and Implementation

The campaign was driven by policies set in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Key aspects included:

- **Collectivization of Agriculture**: Mao put peasants on communes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This meant the Party gained control of the food supply, effectively deciding "who lives and who dies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The speaker suggests this move aligned with communist ideology but also served to extend Party control over the vast peasant population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>.
- **Decentralized Industry**: Industry was decentralized, famously featuring "backyard furnaces" where peasants were encouraged to produce steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:38">[01:02:38]</a>.
- **Other Policies**: Peasants were instructed to shoot sparrows, which reportedly led to locust infestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

### Consequences

- **Economic Collapse**: Both agricultural and industrial production collapsed as a result of these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
- **The Great Famine**: Despite the collapse in food production, Mao continued to export food, as it was a major source of government income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This led to the Great Famine, described as the only nationwide famine in Chinese history not caused by weather but by government policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
  - Approximately 40 million Chinese starved to death, primarily in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Peasant girls were disproportionately affected as the least valued members of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
  - The statistic of 40 million deaths is documented in Yang Jisheng's book _Tombstone_, based on his investigation of provincial archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
- **Mao's Situational Awareness**: It was noted that during this period, despite millions dying, Mao was told grain harvests were higher than ever and continued to export grain, indicating a loss of situational awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. The speaker suggests Mao's primary objective was maintaining power for himself and the Communist Party, rather than the welfare of the people, and that he was implementing an incorrect basic economic theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>.
- **Political Fallout for Mao**: High-level CCP officials like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping saw the disastrous impact of the Great Leap Forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:15">[01:28:15]</a>. Peng Dehuai, who had lost siblings to starvation, and Liu Shaoqi eventually "pulled the plug on Mao," leading to Mao's demotion from one of his positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:29">[01:28:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.

### Legacy

The Great Leap Forward, along with the Cultural Revolution, is seen by some as such a visceral counterexample that it was needed for reformers to later pursue more pro-growth policies in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:13">[01:35:13]</a>.

## The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976)

The Cultural Revolution was a sociopolitical movement set in motion by Mao Zedong.

### Origins

- **Mao's Power Struggle**: After being demoted following the failures of the Great Leap Forward, Mao launched the Cultural Revolution as a way to regain power and oust his opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:51">[01:28:51]</a>.
- **Fear of Posthumous Denunciation**: Mao was also motivated by Khrushchev's 1956 secret speech denouncing Stalin. Mao did not want the same thing to happen to him after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.

### Events

- **Mobilization of Youth**: Mao got out of Beijing and rallied the youth, known as the Red Guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:58">[01:28:58]</a>. These teenagers, educated in communist ideology and believing Chairman Mao was beloved, were told they should be in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:06">[01:29:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>.
- **Attacks on Authority and "Old Ways"**: The Red Guards began by attacking and killing their teachers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:25">[01:29:25]</a>. They then worked their way up the educational system and fanned outward, leading to a period described as a "semi-civil war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:36">[01:29:36]</a>.
- **Victim Participation**: A notable aspect of the Cultural Revolution was that victims were often forced to participate in their own victimization, for example, by publicly confessing guilt ("I'm guilty") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:23">[01:37:23]</a>. This was contrasted with regimes like Hitler's, which focused on annihilation without requiring such participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:32">[01:37:32]</a>.
- **Restoration of Order**: Military leader Lin Biao eventually helped Mao restore order, but only after Mao had ousted those who were trying to remove him from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a>.

### Consequences

- **Economic and Social Disruption**: The Cultural Revolution was ruinous for production and gutted the Chinese educational system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:58">[01:29:58]</a>. People with actual knowledge were often targeted and removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>.
- **Personal Suffering**: Many individuals suffered personally, including future leader Xi Jinping. During the "down to the countryside" movement, he was sent to the interior, and there is a story of his own mother having to turn him away when he sought food due to his father being denounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:58">[01:31:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>. Despite this personal suffering, some CCP officials who lived through it remain pro-Mao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a>.
- **Mao's Success**: From Mao's personal perspective, the Cultural Revolution worked extremely well as it solidified his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:10">[01:30:10]</a>.

### Educational Impact

The disruption to the education system during the Cultural Revolution had long-lasting effects. For example, Xi Jinping is described as not being well-educated in a formal sense because he came of age during this period when institutions were not delivering proper education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:29">[01:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>.

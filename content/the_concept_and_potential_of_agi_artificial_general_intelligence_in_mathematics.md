The concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its potential application and demonstration within the field of mathematics, particularly concerning advanced problem-solving like the International Math Olympiad (IMO), was a key topic of discussion featuring Grant Sanderson (3Blue1Brown). The conversation explored the definition of AGI, the significance of AI achieving high-level mathematical feats, and the nature of creativity in AI.

## Defining AGI

Grant Sanderson expressed skepticism about the clarity and utility of the term "AGI" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. He noted that the definition of AGI varies significantly among different people, with many seeking a discrete, benchmarked change from non-AGI to AGI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Sanderson suggested that the development of AI capabilities feels more continuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

He acknowledged that models like GPT-4 feel "general" in the sense that a single training algorithm can apply to a vast array of tasks, an advancement that might not have been anticipated decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, he questioned whether "AGI" implies an AI being better than humans across all, or a substantial fraction of, domains, including job replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Sanderson stated, "I don't think that you're going to have something that's this measurable discrete step, much less that a math tournament is going to be an example of what that discrete step would look like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## AI and the International Math Olympiad (IMO)

A central question posed was whether an AI model achieving a gold medal in the International Math Olympiad (IMO) would signify AGI, given the creative problem-solving and chain of thought required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Sanderson views an AI getting IMO gold as a sign that it is "as good as the best" in that specific domain, ticking off another area where AI matches top human performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. He likened this achievement to AI excelling in Go or Chessâ€”super creative and impressive, but analogous to these specific game-playing milestones rather than a leap to general job-replacing intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He anticipated being "very impressed" by such an achievement due to the creativity involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Training for IMO-Level AI
Sanderson speculated that training an AI for IMO gold might resemble AlphaGo's training, involving self-play and leveraging synthetic data, to which mathematics lends itself well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This could involve producing proofs in a proof-checking language like Lean and training on their validity, counterbalanced with English-written versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Nature of AI-Generated Proofs
If an AI were to achieve IMO gold, Sanderson posited two potential characteristics of its proofs:
1.  It might produce a very good proof that feels "unmotivated" to humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
2.  This contrasts with proofs where one morally understands why the result should be true. An unmotivated proof would leave a human reader able to follow the steps but wondering about the insight behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

He questioned whether generating such proofs equates to the abilities required for job replacement, suggesting the impediments are different (e.g., longer context windows, relationship building) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. An IMO-solving AI would be a more helpful tool, akin to Mathematica, rather than a replacement for human problem-solvers in a broader sense [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity | impact of AI on software development and productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Creativity in Mathematical AI

The discussion highlighted the argument that solving IMO problems often depends on developing the right abstraction or novel ways of thinking, which seems distinct from pattern recognition in games like chess [[alphazero_and_efficient_search_techniques | AlphaZero and Efficient Search Techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Sanderson agreed that top-level Go and Chess also require more than simple tree search, involving higher-level structural understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. He acknowledged the "lateral thinking" and creativity necessary for complex math problems, comparing the joy of such solutions to that derived from good artistic analogies and creative AI outputs like those from Stable Diffusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. While deeply impressed by this potential, he reiterated that this level of mathematical creativity falls into the same category as artistic AI creativity and does not signify a discrete "post-AGI" state [[ai_safety_and_existential_risks | AI safety and existential risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

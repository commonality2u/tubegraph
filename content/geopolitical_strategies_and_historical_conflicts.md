This article outlines the complex geopolitical interactions between Russia, the United States, and China, and their interventions in the affairs of India and Pakistan, primarily during the Cold War era. It explores pivotal decisions, shifting alliances, key conflicts, and the various instruments of national power employed by these nations, leading to both expected and highly unexpected long-term consequences.

## Core Concepts
The discussion revolves around two primary themes:
1.  **Intervening in others' problems**: A common practice, especially for the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
2.  **Understanding Alignments**: The crucial need to assess who the primary adversary of whom is, the history of these relationships, and the positions of neighboring countries before intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
The article also focuses on a series of **limited wars**, defined as conflicts for objectives less than regime change, where the initial governments remain in place post-war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Pivotal Decisions and Situations

### 1. China's Conquest of Tibet
Following Mao Zedong's victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, China spent the next two years consolidating power, which included conquering Xinjiang and Tibet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Tibet, autonomous since 1911 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, held significant mineral resources (around 40% of China's total) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Strategic Road Construction (1950-1957)**: China built crucial road systems through Tibet. The western route was particularly vital as it allowed year-round traffic, unlike the eastern routes which were hampered by mountain ranges, monsoons, snow, mudslides, and river systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. India discovered these roads only in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Impact**: This western route enabled control over Tibet and provided a pincer onto Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It also directly led to border disputes with India over the Aksai Chin plateau (taken by China) and Arunachal Pradesh (held by India, claimed by China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The conquest eliminated Tibet as a buffer zone, reducing it to the Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Dalai Lama's Flight**: In 1959, as the People's Liberation Army advanced on Lhasa, the Dalai Lama fled to India, which angered China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### 2. US "Pactomania" and Alliance with Pakistan
Under President Eisenhower, the US pursued a strategy of "pactomania," forming bilateral and regional alliances to counter the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Baghdad Pact**: This pact included Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Pakistan, aimed at walling off the Soviet Union from Middle Eastern oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **US-Pakistan Military Aid Treaty**: As a sweetener for Pakistan joining, the US allied with Pakistan and provided significant military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Indian Reaction**: Indian Prime Minister Nehru was horrified, stating it changed the balance of power and that Pakistan would use US arms against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Eisenhower later admitted this was "perhaps the worst kind of plan and decision we could ever have made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This pact poisoned US-India relations throughout the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### 3. The Devolving Sino-Soviet Relationship
Until China acquired atomic weapons in 1964, Mao was reliant on Soviet technological aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Mao's Grievances**: After detonating an atomic weapon, Mao asserted that Russia occupied too many territories, including areas historically in the Chinese sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Other issues included Stalin's actions regarding Japan before WWII, taking Mongolia, fighting "to the last Chinese" in Korea, advising Mao to halt at the Yangtze during the Civil War, Khrushchev's opposition to Mao as senior statesman of communism, de-Stalinization, and peaceful coexistence with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. These issues became public with the Sino-Soviet split propaganda in 1960 [[sinoindian_and_sinosoviet_relations]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Russian Grievances**: The Soviets wanted bases in China (like former Tsarist treaty ports) but were refused. China's actions during the Taiwanese Strait crises (1954, 1958) alarmed the Soviets as they were not consulted despite a friendship treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. When Russia asked for a combined naval base, China refused, leading Russia to withhold atomic weapon plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Vietnam War Tensions**: Both China and Russia sought influence over Vietnam and wanted to prove revolutionary credentials. Russian aid to North Vietnam had to transit through China, where the Chinese harassed Russian shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Sino-Soviet Border Conflict (1969)**: Fighting erupted over river islands like on the Amur River. The Soviets approached the US about potentially nuking China, but the US refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This event led Mao to identify Russia as China's primary adversary, shifting the dynamic where previously both saw the US as their main opponent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Alliances and Alignments
The term "alliance" is used loosely to refer to mutual defense pacts [[cold_war_and_international_alliances]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Early Indian Foreign Policy and Relations
*   **India and the Superpowers**: Khrushchev saw India as an important counterbalance to China, while Stalin had dismissed Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Nehru aimed for friendly terms with both Russia and America but felt more commonality with Russia due to his Fabian socialist economic policies and his disapproval of US segregation and its ties to colonial powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **India's Generosity to China**:
    *   Immediately recognized China in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
    *   Refused to sign the San Francisco Treaty (1951) ending the war with Japan because China and Russia weren't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   Signed a friendship treaty with China, recognizing Chinese sovereignty over Tibet to help China break diplomatic isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This recognition is permanent under international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
    *   From 1960, voted to seat the PRC (not Taiwan) in the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **China's Sovereignty Swap Offer**: China offered to recognize Indian sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh in exchange for Indian recognition of Chinese sovereignty over Aksai Chin. Nehru refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Shifting Alignments Post-1962 Sino-Indian War
*   India began looking to Russia to counterbalance China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   Pakistan, noticing China's break with India, saw China as a potential ally. Bhutto played the "China card" for nuclear assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   In 1963, Pakistan ceded territory to China, possibly in exchange for nuclear development help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Pakistan-China & India-Russia Dynamics**: Pakistan and China shared India as a common problem; Russia and India shared China as a common problem. These pairings worked relatively well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

### The US Dilemma in South Asia
The US struggled because befriending either India or Pakistan would appall the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   US Goal: For India and Pakistan to unite against China and communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   India/Pakistan Goal: Use US aid against each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.
*   Pakistan wanted the US to have good relations with China [[china_and_the_uss_race_in_ai_and_superintelligence]], which was a non-starter for the US until 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

## Key Conflicts and Their Consequences

### Sino-Indian War (1962)
*   **Context**: Occurred during the Cuban Missile Crisis when Russia was preoccupied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: China swiftly took the Aksai Chin Plateau. India, lacking roads for deployment, suffered a total defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Nehru's Reaction**: Expressed deep betrayal, stating China returned "evil for good" after India's consistent friendship and advocacy for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. 
*   **Long-term Impact**: India, previously idealistic and non-militarized, became permanently angered, doubled its army size within 10 years (to 750,000), and created 10 mountain divisions for use against China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The speaker posits a different world order had China and India teamed up instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

### Indo-Pakistani War of 1965
*   **Pakistan's Motivation**: India appeared militarily feckless after the 1962 war, and Nehru died in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. Pakistan invaded first in the Rann of Kutch, then aimed for Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Indian Response**: India invaded near Lahore, surprising Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **US Action**: Imposed a double arms embargo on both nations. Pakistan, more reliant on US aid, suffered more from a lack of spare parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. The US had previously guaranteed its arms wouldn't be used by India and Pakistan against each other but couldn't enforce this; Pakistani used US tanks against India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Pakistan lost. The Soviets brokered the Tashkent Declaration to end the war, a move welcomed by the US, as neither superpower wanted the conflict to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. India restored its military reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

### Bangladesh War of Independence (1971)
*   **Background**: Pakistan held elections. Bengalis in East Pakistan won, but the dominant Punjabis in West Pakistan were furious and sent the army to East Pakistan, leading to mass killings and refugees pouring into India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>.
*   **US Stance**: The US remained silent on the humanitarian crisis because Nixon was secretly trying to establish relations with China (with Pakistan as an intermediary) to counter the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. The US blamed India for the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Indian Response**: Furious with the US, India signed a military pact with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a> and upgraded relations with Vietnam. India also armed insurgents in East Pakistan and then sent in its conventional army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: East Pakistan became Bangladesh. Pakistan lost over half its population and was no longer the most populous Muslim country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:49">[00:38:49]</a>. The war prompted both India (against China) and Pakistan (against India's superiority) to pursue nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

### Sino-Soviet Border Conflict (1969)
*   **Event**: Armed clashes occurred between China and the Soviet Union, notably over river islands like on the Amur River [[cold_war_history_and_its_modern_implications]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Question**: The Soviets asked the US if it would be acceptable to use nuclear weapons against China. The US said no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Shift in Alignments**: Mao identified the power willing to nuke China (the USSR) as the primary adversary. This marked a significant shift: Russia and China, who previously both saw the US as their primary enemy, now saw each other as such. This gave the US a "swing position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, which it used to team up with China to overextend Russia in the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

### Kargil War (1999)
Pakistan again attempted to take territory in Kashmir below the Line of Control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:05">[00:39:05]</a>. Under pressure from both the US (Washington Agreement) and China (who didn't want a nuclear war), Pakistan had to withdraw and was sanctioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.

## Instruments of National Power (The "Plays")

### Diplomacy and Treaties
*   **Indus Waters Treaty (1960)**: Brokered by the US, this treaty massively benefited both India and Pakistan by facilitating dam construction for irrigation. The US contributed half of the $1 billion cost. Despite its success, the US received no enduring gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>.
*   **Failed US Diplomacy**: Attempts to get India and Pakistan to settle differences were a "total flop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>, based on false assumptions that they could be cajoled, that the China threat would unite them, or that Western aid would force cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. The brutality of Partition was a major underlying factor for their animosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>.
*   **Great Power Alignment**: When major powers (e.g., US and Russia) aligned, they could achieve results, such as the Tashkent Agreement (1965 war) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a> and forcing Pakistan's withdrawal in the Kargil conflict (1999) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Similar cooperation tamped down tensions after terrorist incidents in New Delhi and Mumbai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.

### Public Support and UN Vetoes
*   **Goa (1961)**: The US supported Portugal (a NATO ally with important US bases) when India retook the Portuguese colony of Goa, angering India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:03">[00:49:03]</a>.
*   **India's Silence on Soviet Actions**: Nehru's India remained silent on the 1956 Hungarian crisis and the 1961 Berlin crisis. Indira Gandhi's India was silent on the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia and the 1979 invasion of Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.
*   **Russian UN Vetoes for India**: Russia used its UN Security Council veto to block plebiscites in Kashmir (which India opposed) and to prevent a UN resolution halting India's offensive in the 1971 Bangladesh war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:13">[00:50:13]</a>.

### Economic Aid
*   The US provided far more economic aid than Russia or China, yet Pakistan and India generally preferred China and Russia respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>.
*   **Bihar Famine (1967)**: The US sent 20% of its wheat crop ($1.5 billion worth) to India. However, President Johnson, angry at India's perceived friendliness with North Vietnam, provided the aid "ship to mouth" (at the last minute), infuriating Indira Gandhi. India achieved food self-sufficiency (partly due to the Green Revolution spearheaded by Ford and Rockefeller foundations), and the US received no gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Donor Competition**: Indian advisor Krishna Menon noted India's strategy to encourage competition among aid donors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

### Military Aid
Military aid proved even more difficult to calibrate than economic aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>.
*   US military aid to Pakistan (Baghdad Pact) pushed India towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.
*   US aid to India after the 1962 Sino-Indian war alienated Pakistan, pushing it towards China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   US aid to Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) to counter Soviets in Afghanistan was partly diverted to fuel the Kashmir insurgency from 1989 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:27">[00:53:27]</a>, contributing to regional instability and having "9/11 follow-on effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.
*   China provided nuclear assistance to Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.

### Military Deployments
*   **USS Enterprise (1971)**: The US sent its first nuclear-propelled aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise, into the Bay of Bengal during the Bangladesh War. Russia also sent naval assets. This had no effect on the war's outcome (Pakistan lost) but infuriated India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:03">[00:54:03]</a>.

### Sanctions and Embargoes
The US frequently used sanctions and embargoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:36">[00:54:36]</a>:
*   At Partition against all parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
*   During the 1965 Indo-Pak war against both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>.
*   Related to nuclear proliferation progress by India and Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:49]</a>. Pakistan felt unfairly targeted as India tested a nuclear device in 1974, well before Pakistan did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>.
*   Sanctions ultimately failed to stop proliferation, as evidenced by tit-for-tat nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in 1998. The US eventually gave up on this approach, especially after 9/11 when Pakistan's cooperation was needed for Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:19">[00:55:19]</a>.

### Territorial Concessions
Pakistan ceded territory to China in 1963, speculated to be in exchange for nuclear assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.

### Funding Insurgencies
This tactic was used by the US, Russia, China, India, and Pakistan to pin down adversaries by supporting secessionist minority groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>.
*   **US**: Belatedly aided Tibetans (1957-1961), but Chinese road infrastructure was already complete, making the effort ineffective and costly for Tibetans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.
*   **China**: Funded insurgencies in India (Mizos, Manipuris, Nagas, Naxalites) from after the 1962 war until 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:03">[00:57:03]</a>.
*   **Pakistan**: Supported insurgency in Kashmir [[indiapakistan_geopolitical_dynamics]]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:44">[00:57:44]</a>.
*   **India**: Accused by Pakistan of funding Baloch separatists and encouraging Pashtun insurgency to divert Pakistani attention from Kashmir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: These actions often lead to "frozen conflicts" where outside powers bear few costs while local populations suffer death, lack of economic growth, and intractable hatreds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Examples include Kashmir, Korea, and Palestine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>.

## The "Cutthroat Billiards" Game: Navigating Complex Geopolitics

The interactions between the five nations (US, Russia, China, India, Pakistan) are likened to a game of "five-person cutthroat billiards," where every ball can be a cue ball, players join and leave at will, and cooperation is fleeting as ultimate goals differ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>.

### Pakistan's Strategic Position and US Relations
*   **Strategic Importance**: Pakistan's location (Mackinder's "inner marginal crescent") was crucial for US listening posts on the Soviet Union (pre-satellite imagery) and access to Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a>.
*   **Fluctuating US Interest**: US interest in Pakistan waxed and waned based on immediate needs:
    *   U2 bases (e.g., Peshawar) and Badaber listening post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Khrushchev threatened Pakistan after a U2 was shot down in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
    *   Pakistan as an intermediary for US outreach to China (Nixon era) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.
    *   Essential for aiding insurgents against Soviets in Afghanistan (1980s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. This led to President Zia calling Carter's $400M aid offer "peanuts," with Reagan upping it to $3.2B channeled via the ISI, significantly empowering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
    *   Cooperation needed when the US was in Afghanistan, until the Osama bin Laden raid strained relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.
*   **Pakistani Frustration**: Ayub Khan accused the US of betrayal, building up India, failing to help in the 1965 war, and stopping military aid, leading to the cancellation of the Badaber lease in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **Consequences for Pakistan**: Wars generally resulted in losses (1965: nothing gained, loss of US aid; 1971: loss of Bangladesh; 1999 Kargil: humiliation and sanctions). Opportunity costs were immense, diverting funds from development and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

### India's Challenges with the United States
*   **Mutual Distrust**: Mahatma Gandhi criticized US segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Nehru and Indira Gandhi found the US difficult to work with, viewing capitalism as a path to imperialism, while the US saw socialism as a path to communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Indian "Self-Inflicted Blows"**: Nehru, Krishna Menon, and Indira Gandhi often made insulting remarks to American VIPs, damaging relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Declining US Support for India**:
    *   1940s (Kashmir): India expected US support as a secular democracy; US was appalled by India's non-alignment during Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
    *   1962 Sino-Indian War: US supported India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
    *   1965 Indo-Pak War: US was neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:22">[00:41:22]</a>.
    *   1971 Bangladesh War: US supported Pakistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. This led India to sign a military pact with Russia and deny visas to US scholars, impacting Indian studies programs in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

### China's Strategic Calculations
*   **Sino-Indian War (1962)**: China gained territory (Aksai Chin) but created a permanent enemy in India, forfeiting a potential alliance that could have reshaped the global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:44">[00:41:44]</a>.
*   **Post-1971 War**: The conflict indirectly spurred nuclear proliferation, as India sought weapons against China, and Pakistan sought them against India's conventional superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

### Russia's Relatively Successful Indian Relationship
The Russia-India relationship was generally positive and cordial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.
*   Russia offered India military and economic aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:07">[00:43:07]</a>.
*   Provided crucial UN Security Council vetoes for India (e.g., on Kashmir plebiscites and during the Bangladesh War) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>.
*   India served as a useful counterbalance to China for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

## Strategic Takeaways
*   **Common Enemies**: Cannot be artificially conjured. Alignments must be carefully assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **Understanding Players**: Analyze primary objectives, adversaries, and theaters of interest for all potential actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.
*   **Reassessment**: Continuously reassess assumptions and be willing to change course based on new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>.
*   **Veto Players**: Expect them in ethnically diverse regions with long histories of conflict, making settlements difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.
*   **Feasibility**: Recognize that some problems are not feasible to solve; focus scarce resources on solvable issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>.
*   **Great Power Alignment**: When great powers align, significant actions can be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>.
*   **Small and Medium Powers**: Collectively, their wealth and influence can exceed that of any single great power, making their agreement crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

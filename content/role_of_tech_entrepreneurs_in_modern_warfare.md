The nature of modern warfare is increasingly influenced by the involvement of tech entrepreneurs and their companies. This dynamic, particularly highlighted in the Russo-Ukrainian War, sees private individuals and their technological innovations playing significant roles in military capabilities and strategic outcomes [[impact_of_historical_decisions_on_modern_warfare | impact of historical decisions on modern warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.

## Impact in the Russo-Ukrainian War

The conflict in Ukraine has been described as the "first proper internet war" [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | impact of AI on future technology and society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>, showcasing the profound impact of technology provided and driven by entrepreneurial efforts.

### Starlink and Communications
Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service has been invaluable to Ukraine [[impact_of_technological_change_on_politics | impact of technological change on politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>. It has provided crucial communication capabilities, allowing soldiers with iPhones on the battlefield to upload images and map references. This information, in turn, proves extremely useful for targeting by drones and artillery [[the_impact_of_design_and_technology_in_education | the impact of design and technology in education]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>.

### Open-Source Intelligence and Civilian Contribution
The accessibility of technology like smartphones, coupled with services like Starlink, enabled a new kind of warfare where the native Ukrainian population could provide accurate, real-time intelligence [[open_source_ai_models_and_their_implications | open source AI models and their implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. This widespread information gathering from open sources was a significant factor in preventing the fall of Kyiv in the initial stages of the war, as Ukrainian artillery received accurate data from a multitude of sources [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | the role of cultural and technological innovations in human evolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:50">[00:57:50]</a>. The Russians took a long time to catch up with this development, partly because they lacked similar support from the local population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>.

### Innovation and Global Tech Support
The Ukrainians have demonstrated an "extraordinarily impressive" innovative stance, particularly in their use of drones [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | the evolution and future of the tech industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:15">[00:58:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:25">[00:58:25]</a>. Furthermore, tech professionals and companies from around the world actively supported Ukraine, which "really did move the dial" in the conflict [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | historical influences on leadership and innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:33">[00:58:33]</a>. Companies such as Palantir are noted for making huge advances in this domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>.

## Influence of Individual Entrepreneurs

Individual tech entrepreneurs can wield significant influence over the conduct of warfare.
*   **Elon Musk:** His decision to provide Starlink was crucial, but he also notably refused to extend its service to aid a specific Ukrainian naval surprise attack on Crimea [[the_role_and_future_of_microsoft_in_the_context_of_global_technological_advancements | the role and future of Microsoft in the context of global technological advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:47">[00:55:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:41">[00:56:41]</a>. This illustrates the power of tech entrepreneurs to dictate where and how their technology is employed in conflicts [[comparisons_between_atomic_bomb_development_and_modern_ai_advancements | comparisons between atomic bomb development and modern AI advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   Andrew Roberts suggests that individuals like Musk are among the most important private individuals to affect warfare since historical industrialists like Thyssen and Krupp before World War I [[cold_war_and_international_alliances | Cold War and international alliances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

## Government Interaction and Technology Control

The podcast touches upon the possibility of governments expropriating technology from entrepreneurs [[government_and_policy_coordination_on_ai_risks | government and policy coordination on AI risks]]. However, Roberts views this as unlikely, except perhaps in times of extreme national crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:21">[00:56:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>.

## Overall Assessment and Future Outlook

The involvement of tech entrepreneurs in warfare is seen as a "very wide and I think overall very positive area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:33">[00:56:33]</a>. The fact that the cutting edge in tech entrepreneurial ability largely resides in the West is considered beneficial for Western countries and democracy [[economic_and_political_structures_in_historical_contexts | economic and political structures in historical contexts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:49">[00:58:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>. This marks a "new world" in warfare, one that could potentially be an "extremely good new world for the west and for democracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:28">[00:59:28]</a>.

This trend aligns with broader discussions about the future of war, which will heavily feature technologies like drones, artificial intelligence, robotics, cyber capabilities, and advanced sensors [[the_impact_of_modern_technology_on_warfare_and_strategy | the impact of modern technology on warfare and strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a> â€“ all areas where tech entrepreneurs are often at the forefront of development and application.

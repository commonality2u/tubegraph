Moving abroad from Canada involves significant financial and legal considerations, particularly regarding your tax residency status. Understanding how to sever ties with Canada for tax purposes and the implications for your investments and income is crucial for a smooth transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Becoming a Non-Resident of Canada

To become a non-resident for tax purposes, you must [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | sever significant residential ties]] with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This includes actions such as:
*   Selling your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Closing Canadian bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   Relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

The most significant factor determining your non-residency status is where you spend your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It is important to keep [[forms_and_actions_to_confirm_nonresidency_for_tax_purposes | documentation]] of your new residency status, such as rental agreements and utility bills, to confirm your new tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Departure Tax

When you leave Canada, you should be aware of the "departure tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This tax applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties, as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. You will need to pay tax on the unrealized gains of your investments and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Some assets are exempt from departure tax:
*   Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Registered Income Funds (RIFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   Certain real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

You are required to report these deemed dispositions on your final Canadian tax return and pay any capital gains tax on the unrealized gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Impact on Canadian Accounts and Pensions

As a non-resident, your Canadian financial accounts and pensions will be affected:

*   **Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)**: Your TFSA can remain open while you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. However, you cannot make [[implications_of_nonresident_contributions_to_tfsa | contributions]] to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, though earnings within the TFSA will still be tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **RRSPs and RIFs**: You can keep your RRSP and RIF accounts open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Withdrawals from these accounts will be subject to a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This withholding tax might be reduced by [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] depending on the country you move to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These are key [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax considerations for Canadian retirees abroad]].
*   **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**: You can continue to receive [[tax_implications_of_cpp | CPP]] payments while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Old Age Security (OAS)**: You may be eligible to receive OAS payments outside of Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

For more detailed information on how your TFSA, RRSP, CPP, and OAS are affected, further research is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Understanding New Country Rules

Figuring out Canada's non-resident rules is only part of the process; understanding the rules of your new country is often more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Consider the following:
*   **Residency and Tax Laws**: Research the residency requirements of your new country, including applications for temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Some countries require you to register your address upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident in the new country and investigate [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This is part of [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | tax implications on Canadian income for nonresidents]].
*   **Visa Laws**: Familiarize yourself with different visa options, required documents, timelines, and conditions (e.g., restrictions on work, study, length of stay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Know the procedures for renewing your visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Learn how to open a local bank account, choose a reputable bank, and prepare necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Understand the local currency, exchange rates, and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

It is highly recommended to consult a cross-border tax specialist if you are seriously considering moving countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

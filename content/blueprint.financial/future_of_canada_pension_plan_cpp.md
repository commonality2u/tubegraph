Despite concerns among 64% of Canadians that the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] may not be available when they retire, influenced by factors like aging populations, rising costs, and discussions around Alberta potentially leaving the CPP, the fund is more secure than commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores four key reasons why the CPP is unlikely to run out of funds.

## Reason 1: The CPP has Outperformed Expectations

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] Investments have significantly exceeded initial financial projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

*   **Fiscal Year 2024 Performance**
    *   For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
    *   The fund achieved an 8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   Total assets reached $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

*   **Exceeding Projections**
    *   In 2000, the CPP was projected to reach $425 billion by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Instead, the fund hit $632 billion in 2023, surpassing projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This significant outperformance indicates effective investment strategies and sound long-term decisions by fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   The fund has demonstrated resilience, continuing to grow even during challenging economic periods such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   This growth ensures the CPP can adequately support the increasing number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Reason 2: Sustainability for Generations

The CPP is designed for long-term sustainability, ensuring it can support future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

*   **Chief Actuary's Report**
    *   Every three years, the Chief Actuary of Canada assesses the CPP's financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   The latest report confirms the CPP is on solid ground for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **Projected Asset Growth**
    *   Currently at $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   Projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion by 2040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Anticipated to reach $3.6 trillion by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   These forecasts demonstrate the fund's long-term potential and sustainability, positioning it to support current and future Canadian retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The CPP is expected to remain financially stable and solvent into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Reason 3: Trustworthiness of Reporting

The accuracy and reliability of [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] reports are ensured through multiple layers of independent oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

*   **Chief Actuary of Canada**
    *   Provides impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Operates independently of political influence, ensuring reports are accurate and free from external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   The 31st Actuarial Report, completed in 2022, re-confirmed the CPP's sustainability for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)**
    *   Reviews the Chief Actuary's reports, adding an additional layer of independent scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   The PBO is recognized for its independence, transparency, and non-partisanship, providing objective, factual analysis to ensure data trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*   **External Audits**
    *   Further assurance comes from external audits, such as Deloitte's 2022 audit, which confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   These multiple layers of independent oversight, including the Chief Actuary, PBO, and external audits, reinforce the strong reasons to trust the transparency and findings of CPP reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. While a vast government conspiracy leading to audit failures is theoretically possible, the extensive scrutiny makes the CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

> [!idea] Pro Tip
> Always seek independent audits or third-party reviews when evaluating financial reports for pension funds or companies to make informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Reason 4: Investment Performance and Management

The performance and management of CPP Investments are crucial to the fund's long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Strong Long-Term Returns**
    *   CPP Investments achieved a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   It also delivered a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   This performance has driven the fund's assets to $632 billion, exceeding projections by over $150 billion, showcasing the success of its investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

*   **Diversified Global Portfolio**
    *   The fund is globally diversified across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   It invests in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the remainder spread across international markets, reducing home risk by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

*   **Active Management Strategy**
    *   CPP Investments employs an active management approach to achieve returns, investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   This strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term, though it may underperform in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. For example, the 8% net return for fiscal 2024 fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    *   However, for a pension fund like the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]], active management is essential for addressing the complexities of pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The significant growth of CPP assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates sound investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] stands as Canada's reliable retirement backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Its strong performance, long-term sustainability, reliable reporting, and strategic investment management provide peace of mind that it will likely be available when needed for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

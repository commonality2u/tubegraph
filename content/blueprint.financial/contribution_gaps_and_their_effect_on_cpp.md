Even if an individual earns a high [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | salary]] and chooses to delay their [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] collection, they may still fall short of the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum CPP benefits]] due to gaps in their [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | contribution history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35">[04:35]</a>. The amount of [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | CPP payout]] depends on an individual's lifetime contributions, not just their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. To receive the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum CPP benefits]], an individual generally needs to have at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.

## Common Reasons for [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | Contribution Gaps]]

Many Canadians do not meet the 39-year contribution requirement due to various gaps in their work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>:

*   **Career Breaks** Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care can lead to years with no [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[05:12]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership** If an individual was self-employed and paid lower [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] contributions, or did not contribute consistently, it can reduce their lifetime average [[earnings | earnings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment** Years of unemployment, even if followed by a high [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | salary]], can lower the overall average [[earnings | earnings]] for [[CPP]] calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry** Retiring before age 65 or starting work later in life may mean an individual does not accumulate the necessary 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>.

For example, Jerry, despite being a high-income earner who delayed [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] until age 70, received less than the full amount due to significant [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | contribution gaps]] from periods like starting a business, going back to school, or unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a>.

## How [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] Accounts for [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | Gaps]]

[[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] calculates retirement benefits based on an individual's best 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26">[06:26]</a>. To mitigate the impact of inconsistencies in work history, [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] includes a **General Dropout provision** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>.

*   This provision allows individuals to exclude up to 17% of their lowest earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>.
*   Given that [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] considers 47 years of potential contributions (ages 18 to 65), this means approximately 8 years of low or zero contributions can be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43">[06:43]</a>.
*   If [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] is delayed until age 70, the total working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains around 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57">[06:57]</a>.
*   While this provision helps with short gaps, missing more than 8 years of contributions will result in a lower [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | CPP payout]], even if an individual earned a high [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | salary]] and delayed [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07">[07:07]</a>.

The **Child Rearing provision** can also help exclude low-income years for those who took time off to raise children under seven years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21">[05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42">[09:42]</a>.

## Maximizing [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] by Addressing [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | Gaps]]

To get the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum CPP benefits]], it is essential to optimize all three factors: [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | salary]], timing of collection, and consistency of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52">[07:52]</a>.

*   **Maximize Contribution Years** Aim to work for at least 39 years with strong contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29">[09:29]</a>. Missing too many years beyond the dropout provision allowance will lower the average [[CPP]] calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33">[09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38">[09:38]</a>.
*   **Utilize Provisions** Make use of the Child Rearing provision if applicable, to exclude low-income years due to childcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42">[09:42]</a>.

Think of [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP]] as a three-legged stool: [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | salary]], timing of collection, and consistency of contributions. If one leg is weak, the whole structure becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29">[07:29]</a>.

Despite public concern, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is more secure than many Canadians believe, with 64% of Canadians doubting its future availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This skepticism is fueled by factors like aging populations, rising costs, and discussions around Alberta potentially leaving the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the CPP's security is bolstered by strong investment performance and robust management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Outperformance of Expectations

The CPP has consistently outperformed initial expectations, demonstrating the effectiveness of its investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Fiscal Year 2024 Results

In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This performance pushed the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Exceeding Projections

The fund's total assets are significantly higher than initially projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Projections made in 2000 estimated the CPP would reach $425 billion by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Instead, the fund reached $632 billion in 2023, exceeding projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This outperformance reflects sound long-term investment decisions by fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Resilience in Challenging Times

The CPP fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even during challenging economic periods, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This growth ensures the CPP can manage the increasing number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The [[current_and_future_financial_health_of_the_cpp | CPP]] is in excellent financial health, surpassing earlier predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Sustainability and Future Projections

The [[current_and_future_financial_health_of_the_cpp | Canada Pension Plan]] is designed for intergenerational sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The chief actuary of Canada's detailed reviews, conducted every three years, confirm the CPP's financial health is solid for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The fund, currently at $632 billion, is projected to grow significantly:
*   By 2030, it is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   By 2040, assets are projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   By 2050, the fund is expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

These forecasts highlight the long-term potential sustainability of the CPP, positioning it to support both current and future generations of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The CPP is likely to remain financially stable for at least 75 years, indicating solvency well into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Investment Performance and Management

The performance and management of CPP Investments are crucial to its long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Strong Long-Term Returns

CPP Investments has delivered strong long-term returns:
*   A 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   A 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
This sustained performance has driven the fund's assets to $632 billion, surpassing projections significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Diversified Global Portfolio

The fund employs a globally diversified portfolio across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Investments are made in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the remainder spread across international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This approach helps reduce "home bias" risk by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy, enhancing the fund's stability and aligning with [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP and its international considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Active Management Strategy

CPP Investments utilizes an active management approach to achieve returns, specifically investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term, though it may underperform in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. For example, the 8% net return for fiscal 2024 fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Despite occasional underperformance, active management is considered essential for a pension fund like CPP to address the complexities of pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The significant growth of CPP assets, reaching $632 billion, indicates sound investment management over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting

The reliability of CPP reports and audits is maintained through several safeguards:
*   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** Provides impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health, operating independently of political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The 31st Actuarial Report in 2022 confirmed the CPP's sustainability for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** Reviews these reports, adding an independent layer of scrutiny. The PBO is known for being independent, transparent, and nonpartisan, providing objective and factual analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** External audits, such as Deloitte's 2022 audit, confirm that CPP Investments maintains effective internal control over financial reporting, reinforcing trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

These multiple layers of independent oversight, coupled with external audits, provide strong reason to trust the transparency and accuracy of CPP reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This rigorous monitoring makes the CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For Canadians, this means peace of mind, knowing the CPP is thoroughly reviewed and projected to last for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. When evaluating any financial report, seeking independent audits or third-party reviews is crucial for informed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The CPP serves as Canada's reliable retirement backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

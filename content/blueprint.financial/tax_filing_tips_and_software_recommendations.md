The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides hundreds of tax deductions and credits, yet many Canadians miss out on money they are entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article highlights common overlooked tax breaks and offers advice on how to file taxes effectively to maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Overlooked Tax Credits & Deductions

### Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)
The CWB helps low-income Canadians, but up to 240,000 eligible people annually do not claim it, resulting in $175 million left unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The application process can be complicated, and many are unaware they qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Using tax software can significantly improve claim rates compared to paper filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### [[income_splitting_strategies_for_canadian_taxpayers | Pension Income Splitting]]
If you are retired and your spouse is in a lower tax bracket, you can save thousands by transferring up to 50% of your pension income to them, reducing the total household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite the potential savings, many retirees miss this due to lack of awareness or assuming it's automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. To claim, you must fill out form T1032 with your return each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip:** If retiring soon, plan early to strategically adjust pension withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Moving Expenses Deduction
If you moved at least 40 km closer to a new job or school, you may deduct expenses like travel, storage, and temporary accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Many forget to track receipts, missing out on hundreds or thousands in deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip:** You can only deduct moving costs against income earned at the new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### [[family_tax_planning | Spousal RRSP Contributions]]
Instead of only contributing to your own RRSP, contributing to a spousal RRSP can help spread out retirement income and reduce future taxes, especially if one spouse earns significantly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. You still receive the immediate tax deduction, but withdrawals are taxed at the spouse's lower rate later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## How to File Taxes for Free and Never Miss a Tax Break

The right tools can automatically flag missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Software Recommendations
*   **Use Free Tax Software:** For simpler tax returns, programs like Well Simple Tax and TurboTax Free can flag missing credits and deductions and guide you through your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Check CRA My Account:** You can review past tax returns and amend them for a certain period if you missed a tax credit in previous years, potentially getting money back retroactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Use Auto-fill:** Many tax programs pull your tax slips (T4s, RRSP contributions, etc.) directly from the CRA, reducing mistakes and ensuring nothing is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Organization Tips
*   **Use a Receipt Scanning App:** Apps like Expensify or QuickBooks can automatically track receipts by scanning them with your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Create a Tax Receipts Email Folder:** Most tax-related documents arrive via email. Create a dedicated folder now, perhaps one for each year, to easily find everything at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Keep a Quick Tax Deductions Checklist:** Before filing each year, review a simple checklist (e.g., home office, medical expenses, investment fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This can save hundreds or thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Using a spreadsheet, copied and updated each year, can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

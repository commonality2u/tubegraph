Stoic investing is a financial approach inspired by stoicism, an ancient philosophy that emphasizes controlling what is within one's power and disregarding what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. When applied to [[key_investment_strategies_and_options | investing]], this mindset can be transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Contrasting Approaches: Emotional vs. Stoic Investing

Many investors are guided by emotion, experiencing excitement when stocks rise and panic when they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. They frequently second-guess their decisions, react impulsively to market headlines and updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In contrast, those who build significant wealth, such as "RSP millionaires," adopt a stoic approach, adhering to a rules-based system consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Characteristics of Stoic Investors

Stoic investors demonstrate several key behaviors:

*   **Ignoring Market Noise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>: They recognize that short-term market fluctuations and media hype, whether about crashes or soaring stocks, are merely "noise" irrelevant to their long-term objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Instead of making impulsive decisions, they remain focused on their predetermined investment plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Controlling Fear and Greed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>: Unlike average investors who may chase "hot stocks" out of greed when markets are high and panic-sell during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, stoic investors avoid getting caught up in hype or panicking when the market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. They trust their strategy, understanding that adherence to a plan outperforms emotional decisions in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Accepting Volatility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>: They view market fluctuations as an inherent part of [[choosing_investments_and_managing_risk | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While many people panic when their portfolio drops, stoic investors understand that temporary losses are part of achieving long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Seeing Downturns as Opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>: Rather than reacting with fear, they often perceive market downturns as opportunities to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. They continue to invest, confident that markets will recover and grow over decades, not just hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Why This Approach Works

Comparing an emotional investor (Josh) with a stoic investor (Ashley) illustrates the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Josh, who constantly monitors his portfolio and reacts to every market movement by selling low and buying high, sees his returns suffer due to emotional decisions and additional trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Ashley, conversely, invests consistently, remains calm amidst daily market news, and continues contributing to her RSP regardless of short-term movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. After 30 years, Ashley achieves greater wealth, not through brilliant stock picking, but by maintaining composure and sticking to her plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This highlights how a stoic approach helps avoid [[common_investment_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them | common investment mistakes]] driven by emotion.

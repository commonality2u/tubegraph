All-in-one ETFs, also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by bundling multiple ETFs into one fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. They provide instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets, eliminating the need to select individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This approach aims to reduce stress by removing the need for constant rebalancing, second-guessing, or endless research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## What All-in-One ETFs Invest In

As an example, Vanguard's VGRO is one of Canada's most trusted all-in-one ETFs, managing over $6 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It offers exposure to a wide range of global stocks and bonds, providing an instantly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

VGRO's typical allocation includes:
*   **Stocks**: 80% allocation, mixed across Canadian, US, International, and emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This provides access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Bonds**: 20% allocation, a blend of Canadian and global bonds, which helps stabilize the portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This diversification spreads investments across various countries, industries, and asset classes to reduce risk and enhance returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. All of this comes at a low management expense ratio (MER) of 0.24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Top holdings often include major US and Canadian companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, RBC, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Performance Example

An investment of $10,000 in VGRO from January 2020 to 2025 would have grown to approximately $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This demonstrates the potential of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## [[benefits_of_investing_in_allinone_etfs | Benefits of All-in-One ETFs]]

Investors favor all-in-one ETFs for several key reasons:

*   **Low-Cost Alternative**: One of the biggest advantages is their low fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Compared to traditional [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | mutual funds in Canada]] that typically charge around 2% MER, all-in-one ETFs generally range from 0.2% to 0.25% MER, making them significantly more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Automatic Rebalancing**: These ETFs automatically buy and sell within themselves to maintain the desired stock-to-bond ratio, eliminating the need for manual adjustments to your asset mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Smaller Accounts**: For those just starting with TFSAs, RRSPs, or other investment accounts, one ETF provides instant diversification without requiring investments across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Diversification and Time-Saving**: Instead of researching and buying numerous individual stocks and bonds, investors gain a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of global investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Who Should Use All-in-One ETFs

All-in-one ETFs are particularly well-suited for:

*   **Beginners**: Investors new to the market who desire a simple, low-maintenance portfolio without the complexities of stock picking or rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Busy Professionals**: Individuals with demanding careers or businesses who lack the time to actively manage their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Parents Investing for Children's Futures**: Ideal for RESPs or other long-term savings accounts for children's education, providing instant diversification and minimal maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors**: Those starting with smaller accounts (like TFSAs or RRSPs) who want immediate diversification without needing multiple purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## [[choosing_the_right_allinone_etf_based_on_risk_tolerance | Choosing the Right All-in-One ETF]]

When selecting an all-in-one ETF, the provider is less critical than selecting the appropriate asset allocation for your risk tolerance and investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Canadian ETF Landscape

Canada offers several major providers of high-quality all-in-one ETFs:
*   **iShares (BlackRock)**: Known for XGRO, XBAL, XEQT, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Vanguard**: Offers VGRO, VBAL, VEQT, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **BMO**: Provides ZGRO, ZBAL, and ZEQT, offering strong diversification and a big bank brand appeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Horizons**: Features unique swap-based ETFs designed for [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax efficiency]] in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

These providers generally offer low-cost, diversified, and auto-rebalancing ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Matching Risk Tolerance

Instead of focusing on the brand, consider your comfort level with risk:
*   **Higher Risk, Higher Returns**: ETFs with 100% stocks and 0% bonds (e.g., VEQT, XEQT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Balanced Approach (Growth)**: ETFs with 80% stocks and 20% bonds (e.g., VGRO, XGRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Lower Risk, Steady Growth**: ETFs with 60% stocks and 40% bonds (e.g., VBAL, XBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Conservative, Stability-Focused**: ETFs with 40% stocks and 60% bonds (e.g., VCNS, XCNS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Your risk tolerance and investment goals should dictate your choice, provided the ETF's fees are reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## How to Invest in All-in-One ETFs Step-by-Step

1.  **Determine Your Risk Tolerance**: Before buying, assess how much risk you're comfortable with. This helps you choose between aggressive (e.g., VEQT) or balanced (e.g., VBAL) ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Free tools like the Vanguard investor questionnaire can help evaluate your comfort with market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
2.  **Choose a Brokerage**: You'll need a brokerage account to purchase ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Well Simple Trade**: Offers zero commission fees and is excellent for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Questrade**: Also offers zero commission fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   **Big Bank Platforms (e.g., TD Direct Investing, RBC Direct Investing)**: Convenient for those who already bank with them, though they typically charge higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    Ensure you open the correct account type (TFSA, RRSP, or non-registered) based on your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
3.  **Buy the ETF**:
    *   Log into your brokerage account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Search for the ETF by its ticker (e.g., VGRO, ZBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   Enter the desired number of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Choose a market order (immediate purchase) or a limit order (set your desired price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
4.  **Optional: Set up DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan)**: Enable automatic reinvestment of dividends to buy more shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Most brokerages allow this in settings or via customer support, helping compound growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For maximum convenience, set up automatic contributions from your paycheck monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Is One Fund Enough?

Yes, all-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Adding more funds can disrupt their carefully designed balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Each ETF is built to match a specific risk level (aggressive, balanced, or growth-focused) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Mixing and matching can accidentally alter your intended asset allocation and risk exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

However, if you wish to diversify beyond a single all-in-one ETF, you can use separate accounts for different strategies:
*   **TFSA**: Keep it simple with a single all-in-one ETF like VGRO for long-term, tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **RRSP**: Build your own stock portfolio if you enjoy picking individual stocks while keeping a portion passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account**: Focus on [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | tax efficient ETFs]], such as Horizons swap-based ETFs, to minimize taxes on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_allinone_etfs | Common All-in-One ETF Mistakes to Avoid]]

Despite their simplicity, investors often make mistakes that can hinder returns:

*   **Dishonestly Answering Investor Questionnaires**: Failing to answer honestly can lead to choosing an ETF that doesn't match your actual comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Being too conservative might limit growth, while being too aggressive could lead to panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Getting Bored and Over-Tweaking**: The primary advantage of all-in-one ETFs is their "set it and forget it" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Constantly checking accounts or making unnecessary changes due to market swings can negatively impact long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Patience is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account**: Some investors purchase multiple all-in-one ETFs or combine them with other ETFs, believing it provides extra diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This only disrupts the built-in balance and complicates the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. For instance, VGRO already includes 13,000 companies, offering ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Pick one that aligns with your risk tolerance and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

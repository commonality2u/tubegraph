Feeling like you're leaving money on the table during tax season is a common concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Understanding and effectively claiming office and home office expenses can significantly help [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize your deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These are among the [[simple_tax_deductions_for_small_businesses_in_canada | simplest tax deductions for small businesses in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Office Expenses

Office expenses are costs incurred by almost every business and are one of the easiest deductions to claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>.

This category includes:
*   Rent for your office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   Utilities such as water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   Office supplies like pens, paper, and printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Home Office Expenses

[[work_from_home_tax_deduction | Home office expenses]] are often overlooked by small business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, despite their increased relevance today with many transitioning to home-based work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

You can deduct a portion of your home expenses if you use part of your home regularly and exclusively for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

Claimable expenses under this category include:
*   Mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   Maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Calculating Your Claim

To calculate your deduction, measure the square footage of your dedicated workspace in your home and divide it by the total square footage of your dwelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This resulting percentage is what you'll apply to your total home costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

> [!example] Home Office Calculation
> If your home is 2,000 square feet and your office is 200 square feet, then 10% of your home is used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. If your total home expenses for the year are $2,000, you can claim $200 as a business expense (10% of $2,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

The CRA does not provide a strict maximum portion of your home that can be expensed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, but some accountants suggest that deducting up to 20-25% without raising concerns is generally acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

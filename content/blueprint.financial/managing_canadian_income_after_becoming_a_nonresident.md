Even after departing Canada, certain Canadian-sourced incomes could remain taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Understanding these tax obligations is important to avoid unexpected liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Types of Taxable Canadian Income for Non-Residents

As a non-resident, specific types of Canadian income are subject to Canadian taxes:

*   **CPP and OAS**
    These pensions are generally subject to a 25% withholding tax for non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. However, [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaties]] between Canada and other countries can reduce this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Rental Income from Canadian Property**
    Non-residents earning rental income from Canadian properties are typically subject to a 25% withholding tax on the gross rental amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This is applied to the gross income, not the net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **RRSP Withdrawals**
    [[impact_on_rrsp_for_nonresidents | RRSP withdrawals]] by non-residents are generally subject to a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce Withholding Tax

There are strategies to potentially reduce the withholding tax on Canadian-sourced income:

*   **Filing Form NR5**
    Non-residents can apply for a lower withholding tax rate on certain income by filing Form NR5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. If approved, taxes are withheld at a reduced rate based on the expected Canadian tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This reduction is valid for 5 years, but a Canadian tax return must be filed annually to maintain the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Electing Under Section 216 for Rental Income**
    For rental income, non-residents can elect under Section 216 to pay tax on net rental income (gross rental income minus expenses) instead of the standard 25% withholding tax on the gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This often results in a lower tax liability and allows deductions for property-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. To qualify, a Section 216 tax return must be filed annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Tax Treaty Considerations

Withholding tax rates vary by country under Canada's [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Before filing Form NR5 or electing under Section 216, it is advisable to check if your new country has a tax treaty with Canada that automatically lowers your withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For example, moving to the US will likely result in lower CPP, OAS, and RRSP withholding tax rates than the 25% standard rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Managing rental properties and other income sources in Canada as a non-resident can involve ongoing paperwork, tax obligations, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Tax law is complex enough in one country, and it becomes exponentially harder when two tax systems are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Without proper planning, you could end up paying thousands more than necessary or even face double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

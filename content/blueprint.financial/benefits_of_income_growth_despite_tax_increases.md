When receiving a raise, such as moving from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, it is common to enter a higher federal tax bracket in Canada, shifting from a 15% to a 20.5% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often causes concern that the entire salary will be taxed at the new, higher rate, leading to the perception of losing money despite earning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is a common [[misconceptions_about_income_tax | misconception about income tax]] among Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | How Tax Rates Apply to Salary Raises]]

Canada's progressive tax system ensures that only the portion of income falling into a higher bracket is taxed at the higher rate, not the entire salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

*   The first portion of your income, for example, the initial $57,375, remains taxed at the lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the amount above that threshold, in this scenario, the additional $2,625, is taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The majority of the income continues to be taxed at the previous, lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This structure means that your average or effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax bracket you enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> "The first $57,375 of your income is still taxed at 15%. Then only the dollars above that, in this case, the extra $2,625 are taxed at 20.5%. The rest is still just taxed at 15%." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>

### The Bottom Line

Even if a raise places you into a higher tax bracket, you will still take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Increased income is always beneficial, and [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | myths about tax brackets and raises]] should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting pay increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

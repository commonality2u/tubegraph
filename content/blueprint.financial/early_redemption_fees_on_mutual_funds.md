Early redemption fees, also known as short-term trading fees, are penalties some [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] and other investment products impose if an investor sells their holdings too soon after purchasing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These fees are designed to discourage quick turnover and help maintain fund stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. However, they can significantly reduce an investor's returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## How Early Redemption Fees Work

Many [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] typically charge these fees if units are sold within 30 to 90 days of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The fee usually ranges from 1% to 2% of the investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

For instance, the RBC US Equity Fund imposes a 2% short-term trading fee on the value of units sold or switched within 7 days of buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Avoiding Early Redemption Fees

To avoid incurring these costly penalties:

*   **Review Fund Policies** <br> Before investing, always review the fund's short-term trading policies, which are detailed in the fund facts document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Adopt a Long-Term Strategy** <br> Hold your investments for longer periods to avoid triggering redemption penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Consider ETFs** <br> Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are generally a more flexible alternative as most do not charge early redemption fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

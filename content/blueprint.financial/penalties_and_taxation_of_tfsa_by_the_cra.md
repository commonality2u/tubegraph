Did you know that your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can be [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | penalized and taxed by the CRA]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> To keep your TFSA truly tax-free, there are three key red flags to [[avoiding_cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | avoid to stay on the CRA's good side]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

## Red Flag 1: Turning Your TFSA into a Business

One major red flag is using your TFSA for business activities rather than long-term investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

### The Case of Fared Ahamed

Fared Ahamed, an investment advisor, started his TFSA in 2009. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> He engaged in high-volume trading, primarily with penny stocks, flipping them rapidly, sometimes holding them for mere hours or days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> Through this strategy, he grew his initial contribution to over $600,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

However, the CRA determined that the nature and frequency of his trades meant he was running a business inside his TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> As a result, his $617,000 was reclassified as taxable business income, leading to hefty tax bills and potential penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> His case serves as a cautionary tale for those tempted to use their TFSA for day trading. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

### Why the CRA Cares About Day Trading

Day trading involves quick buys and sells to profit from small price changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> The CRA doesn't consider this activity suitable for a TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> They scrutinize trading patterns, and if you are flipping stocks like a professional trader, especially with short holding periods, expert strategies, or borrowed funds, they may deem it a business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> If your TFSA is considered a business, every dollar you earn becomes taxable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> The CRA typically only takes notice if you are a successful day trader. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

### How to Stay on the CRA's Good Side

The CRA does not provide a strict rulebook on what constitutes "too much trading" in a TFSA; it's evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

> [!TIP] Use Common Sense
> The key is to maintain your TFSA's appearance as a long-term investing and savings vehicle, not a trading desk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> Stick to investments you intend to hold for a while, such as ETFs, blue-chip stocks, or bonds, and avoid frequent stock flipping or using leverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

## Red Flag 2: [[Overcontribution_penalties_for_TFSAs | Overcontribution to Your TFSA]]

[[Avoiding_TFSA_overcontribution_penalties | Overcontribution to your TFSA]] is another major pitfall that can lead to significant [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | penalties]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

### Extreme Overcontribution Example

In 2020, one taxpayer overcontributed an astounding $639,950 to their TFSA, using borrowed funds from a line of credit to invest in stocks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> The plan backfired when the CRA imposed a 1% monthly penalty on the excess amount, which meant a penalty of $6,393 every month for the overcontribution in 2020, plus additional penalties and interest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>

Despite claiming they didn't understand the rules and blaming their financial institution, the taxpayer also failed to withdraw the excess funds when instructed by the CRA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> The Federal Court ruled against the taxpayer, stating the overcontribution was not a reasonable error and their delay in removing funds violated rules requiring immediate correction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>

### Non-Resident Contributions

[[Avoiding_TFSA_overcontribution_penalties_and_technical_pitfalls | Overcontributions]] can also occur if you contribute to your TFSA while no longer a Canadian resident. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> For instance, Jessica moved to the US for work but continued contributing $6,000 to her TFSA, unaware that non-residents are not permitted to contribute. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> The CRA charged her a 1% monthly penalty, which accumulated to thousands of dollars over several years because she didn't catch the mistake while living outside Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

### Common Overcontribution Pitfalls

*   **Trusting CRA's Online Contribution Limits**: The CRA's online records may not always be up-to-date. Relying solely on these figures can lead to accidental overcontributions. It is recommended to keep your own records. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   **Re-contributing in the Same Year**: Withdrawing from your TFSA does not immediately restore your contribution room. This room only resets at the beginning of the following calendar year. Re-contributing before January 1st of the next year will result in penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
*   **Not Transferring Investments In Kind**: When moving investments between accounts, selling them and then redepositing the funds into your TFSA can inadvertently cause overcontribution issues. Instead, transfer investments "in kind" without selling them. Be mindful of timing to avoid reducing your contribution room. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

## Red Flag 3: Prohibited Investments in a TFSA

Your TFSA has clear restrictions on what you can invest in. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>

### Definition of Prohibited Investments

Prohibited investments include:
*   **Significant Interest Holdings**: Owning 10% or more of a private company's shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   **Non-Arm's Length Relationships**: Investments in businesses where you or your family have significant control or influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

The CRA enforces these rules to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures, ensuring they remain tools for legitimate, arm's length investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> This also relates to [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_a_tfsa | risks of high-risk investments in a TFSA]].

### Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The penalties for prohibited investments are severe:
*   **50% Special Tax**: If your TFSA acquires a prohibited investment, you face a tax equal to 50% of the fair market value of the investment at the time of acquisition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains**: Any income or capital gains earned from prohibited investments are taxed at 100%, effectively negating any benefit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

For example, if you invest $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative and the shares grow to $50,000, the CRA could deem it prohibited due to your close connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> The result would be a 50% tax on the $50,000 value ($25,000), and the shares would need to be removed from your TFSA, meaning future gains would no longer be tax-free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>

### How to Stay Safe

> [!CAUTION] Consult CRA Guidelines
> To avoid these steep penalties, consult the CRA's guidelines and review their list of qualified investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> Ensure you are only investing in assets that qualify. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

Your TFSA is a powerful wealth-building tool, but only if used wisely and by avoiding these red flags. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>

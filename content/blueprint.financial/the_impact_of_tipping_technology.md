Tipping technology, particularly digital tipping machines, has significantly altered [[tipping_habits_across_different_services_in_canada | tipping habits across different services in Canada]] and contributed to shifts in [[public_opinion_on_tipping_culture_in_canada | public opinion on tipping culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Awkward Tipping Machines

Tipping machines have become ubiquitous, appearing in various establishments from coffee shops to food trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. These machines have made the act of tipping more uncomfortable for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

When using these devices, customers are often presented with a screen prompting them to tip 15%, 20%, or even 30% while the cashier is observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. This public display adds unnecessary pressure, making it feel "cheap" to select a "no tip" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Digital payment options have contributed to the rise in tipping expectations in places that previously saw little to no tipping, such as coffee shops and fast food establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

The machines often push for higher tip percentages, transforming what should be a personal choice into a "public, guilt-driven moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Navigate Tipping Machines

For individuals looking to manage the pressure from these machines, several strategies can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>:

> [!tip] Carry Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>
> Paying with cash bypasses the tipping machine entirely, eliminating the screen and associated pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Be Quick with the Button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>
> When confronted with a tipping machine, make your tipping choice rapidly to minimize the time spent on the screen and reduce perceived pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Set Your Tipping Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>
> Decide on your intended tip amount before reaching the counter, preventing influence from the higher options presented on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Remember It's Optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>
> Not every situation necessitates a tip, and if the service doesn't warrant it, individuals should feel free to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Digital tipping screens are increasing the public and pressured nature of tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. This trend could motivate more consumers to advocate for, or adopt, "no tipping models" or at least become more vocal about their discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

While tipping is deeply ingrained in Canadian culture as a means to reward good service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>, the future of tipping in Canada is expected to involve a blend of traditional tipping, more aggressive tipping technology, and an increasing number of no-tipping experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. The growth of this technology highlights the evolving landscape of [[rise_and_impact_of_tip_percentages | tip percentages]] and the potential for greater consumer choice in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

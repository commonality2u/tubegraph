[[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is a powerful method to manage finances and grow wealth, making you 33% more likely to achieve your financial goals, according to a study at Michigan State University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach transformed personal finance management since 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?
[[benefits_of_tracking_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is similar to tracking weight loss: small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania showed that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw notable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>: those tracking 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The key takeaway is that tracking is correlated with success, even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This principle applies directly to finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can [[strategies_to_increase_net_worth_using_financial_data | spot trends]], make smarter decisions, and stay on course towards [[setting_financial_goals_and_monitoring_progress | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Consistency, not perfection, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Tracking your net worth is akin to steering a ship with a compass; without it, you won't know if you're drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The process doesn't have to be difficult; a simple Google Sheet can make it easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, taking about 10-20 minutes for initial setup and only about 2 minutes for monthly updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## How to Track Net Worth Using a Spreadsheet

A free spreadsheet with a visual dashboard is available to guide you through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Spreadsheet Dashboard Overview
The tracker's end result shows your current net worth, your net worth goal, and the shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It also includes visual representations and a net worth summary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Setup
1.  **Download and Copy:** Access the Google Sheet via the provided link and make a copy to save it to your own computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
2.  **Name by Year:** Rename the copied file with the current year (e.g., "2025 net worth tracker"). It's recommended to start a new tracker at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  **Set Start Month:** Go to the 'Inputs' tab and set the start month to the beginning of your current year, even if you're setting it up mid-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
4.  **Set Net Worth Goal:** Input your desired net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. If unsure, you can refer to videos on average net worth in Canada and the [[importance_of_reaching_the_initial_100000_net_worth | impact of reaching $100,000]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Set a recurring monthly reminder on the first of each month to fill out the net worth tracker. It takes about two minutes and helps maintain commitment to the [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | tracking process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Filling in Your Financial Data
The spreadsheet works for individuals or households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
1.  **Current Assets:** Enter all current assets, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, GICs, and cash accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. You can add more rows if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Cars can also be included here, but remember to depreciate their value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   *Example Recommendation:* Review the number of current accounts. Often, three to five accounts are sufficient, as too many can become cumbersome to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Assets:** Input long-term assets, including registered accounts (TFSA, RSP, FHSA, RESP) and property (e.g., house value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
3.  **Current Liabilities:** List current liabilities like credit card balances, revolving lines of credit, and car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
4.  **Long-Term Liabilities:** Include long-term liabilities such as student loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Analyzing Your Dashboard
Once data is filled, the dashboard provides valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>:
*   **Current Net Worth:** Shows your updated net worth and its percentage change over the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Total Assets and Liabilities:** Summarizes your overall assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal Progress:** Displays your progress toward your net worth goal and the remaining shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend:** Visually tracks your net worth over time. Ideally, you'll see a gradual increase, but dips are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These dips prompt investigation into what caused them (e.g., market fluctuations, high-risk assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, which can help in [[strategies_to_increase_net_worth_using_financial_data | re-evaluating risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Asset vs. Liability Breakdown:** Shows the proportion of current versus long-term assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress:** Details monthly changes in net worth, including drops and percentage increases/decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Yearly Tracking Process
After filling out and analyzing a year's data, create a new copy of the spreadsheet for the following year (e.g., 2026, 2027) and delete the old data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This allows you to accumulate a balance sheet of your net worth over multiple years, comparing your performance year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. [[impact_of_consistent_tracking_on_achieving_financial_success | Consistent tracking]] provides valuable data and helps identify concerning trends early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

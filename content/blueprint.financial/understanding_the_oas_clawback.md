The Old Age Security (OAS) clawback, also known as the recovery tax, can significantly reduce or eliminate your OAS benefits if your income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## OAS Clawback Thresholds and Mechanics
For the 2024 income year, the OAS clawback begins when your income exceeds $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The entire OAS benefit can be clawed back if your income reaches or exceeds $153,700 annually for individuals under 75, or $153,700 which equals $8,619 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For those age 75 and over, the full clawback threshold is $9,481 annually (or $790.16 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The clawback applies a 15% recovery tax on the amount of income over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Example: David's OAS Clawback
Consider David, a 75-year-old in Canada collecting OAS in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. His income is $160,000, which is well above the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
Because of the OAS clawback, David loses all of his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The 15% recovery tax on the amount over the $90,995 threshold (assuming it's $90,995 based on context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>) amounts to $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Since David's maximum annual OAS benefit is $948, it is completely eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_reduce_oas_clawback | Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the OAS Clawback]]
There are several [[strategies_to_reduce_oas_clawback | strategies to reduce or avoid]] the OAS clawback entirely, potentially saving over $9,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### 1. Delaying CPP Payments
One effective strategy is to [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | delay your CPP payments]] until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** Delaying CPP not only [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | increases your CPP payments by up to 42%]] but also lowers your taxable income between ages 65 and 70, when the OAS clawback typically applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Example:** If you're eligible for $1,000 per month in CPP at age 65, delaying until age 70 could increase your monthly payments to $1,420 (a 42% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These higher payments are also indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Peter Parker Example:** Peter experienced an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income from CPP and other retirement sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By delaying CPP, his taxable income was reduced, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $584, saving him over $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. He also secured higher CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### 2. Delaying OAS Payments
[[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | Delaying your OAS payments]] up to age 70 can increase your monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** This provides more income later and can reduce or eliminate the clawback during earlier retirement years when your income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Example:** A $500 per month OAS at age 65 would increase to $680 per month if delayed until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Peter Parker Example (OAS):** Peter's $811 clawback at age 65 was entirely eliminated by delaying his OAS until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This strategy is particularly effective when income is high between ages 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Important Note:** Delaying CPP and OAS is not always advisable, especially if you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Personalized planning is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### 3. Using Your TFSA Wisely
A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is an excellent tool to avoid the OAS clawback because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** You can access TFSA funds for living expenses without increasing your taxable income, helping you stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Example:** Withdrawing $20,000 annually from a $100,000 TFSA for living expenses incurs no taxes and isn't counted as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. In contrast, withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like an RRSP could push your income over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip: RSP-TFSA Ladder:** Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This keeps your taxable income lower later and allows tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting
Pension income splitting can reduce your taxable income and help avoid the OAS clawback, particularly if one spouse earns significantly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Mechanism:** You can transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Example:** Peter Parker earns $60,000 annually from his pension, while his wife Mary Jane earns less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. By transferring $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane, Peter's taxable income drops to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This places him in a lower tax bracket and reduces the risk of the OAS clawback, while Mary Jane is taxed at her lower bracket, resulting in overall tax savings for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. By reducing Peter's taxable income, they keep his total income below the OAS clawback threshold of $90,997, preserving his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### 5. Managing RRIF Withdrawals
When your RRSP converts to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) at age 71, minimum annual withdrawals become mandatory and are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These can push your income over the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** You can minimize this impact by using your younger spouse's age to reduce the withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Example:** If Peter is 71 and Mary Jane is 65, they can use Mary Jane's age to calculate the RRIF withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Normally, Peter would withdraw 5.28% at age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Basing it on Mary's age (65), the rate drops to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For a $200,000 RRIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering taxable income by $2,560 and helping them stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### 6. Investing Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts
The type of income from non-registered accounts can significantly affect your taxable income and potentially trigger the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Income Types:**
    *   **Interest income** (from bonds, GICs, savings accounts) is fully taxable at your marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
    *   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   **Capital gains** are only taxed at 50% of your marginal tax rate if you stay under a $250,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, making them more tax-efficient.
*   **Strategy:** Focus on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends to reduce taxable income and stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Example:** If your portfolio generates $10,000 in interest income, the full amount is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. If you shift to growth stocks, only half of your gains ($5,000) are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### 7. Capturing Capital Gains Before Age 65
Timing is crucial for managing capital gains to avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Realize capital gains before you turn 65 to avoid large taxable events once OAS payments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While capital gains are taxed favorably, large amounts can still push you over the clawback threshold in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Approach:** Consider realizing gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This allows you to pay taxes earlier and avoids increasing your taxable income during the crucial years when OAS begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Example:** Selling a property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain won't count towards your taxable income during the years OAS begins, keeping you under the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning
Being aware of strategies like [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | delaying CPP and OAS]], using your TFSA, and managing RRIF withdrawals can help you avoid the OAS clawback and retain more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. These actions can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For complex cases involving retirement properties or businesses, personalized planning is often beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

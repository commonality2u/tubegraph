Canada is currently experiencing a serious [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | cost of living crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Approximately 50% of Canadians are living paycheck to paycheck, according to Equifax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Social media reflects widespread struggles, with many individuals sharing their financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A recent Angus Reed poll revealed that a shocking 40% of recent immigrants are contemplating moving to another province or leaving Canada entirely, primarily due to the high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This has led many to question if the "Canadian dream" is still attainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Rising Cost of Everyday Items

Canadians are increasingly frustrated by the rapidly escalating prices of essential goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Food Prices
The grocery store is a clear example of rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. David Olive noted in the Toronto Star that a basket of 18 household items that cost $82 in March 2021 now costs $113.32, a staggering 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The latest Canada Food Price Report predicts an increase of about $701 in the average family of four's annual food bill this year, bringing the total average to $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This follows a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. [[impact_of_inflation_on_food_prices_in_canada | Food prices have consistently outpaced the average rate of inflation]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Rental and Housing Costs
[[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | Rent is another significant concern]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. By July 2024, this average rose to $3,648 per month, a 40% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Housing costs have also soared. In 2015, the average cost to buy a house in Canada was $413,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. By May 2024, this average had skyrocketed to $699,000, representing a 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Essential expenses like shelter and food have become significantly more expensive in the past few years, alongside increases in transportation and entertainment costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Rampant inflation has made it difficult for many Canadians to manage their bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Income Growth Versus Cost of Living
Unfortunately, [[income_growth_versus_cost_of_living_in_canada | income growth has not kept pace with the rising cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. According to Statistics Canada, the median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals was $70,500 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This marks a decrease from $73,000 in 2021, and average wages have likely not increased sufficiently in 2023 or 2024 to counteract inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The rising costs of groceries, household goods, rent, and housing have greatly outpaced income growth, leading to widespread financial struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Further strain has been added by the discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Impact on Canadians

### Interprovincial Migration
Many Canadians are considering moving due to financial pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Approximately 28% of all Canadians are contemplating leaving their current province because of high housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This trend is particularly notable among young adults and renters, and especially in Ontario and British Columbia, where high housing costs have persisted for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Popular relocation spots include Alberta, which is attractive to 18% of Canadians considering a move due to more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A report indicates that net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people between 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Youth Unhappiness
The latest World Happiness Report by the Gallup World Poll ranks Canada as the 15th happiest country overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, Canadians under the age of 30 fall to a significantly lower rank, 58th, highlighting a stark disparity in happiness levels among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Strategies to Combat the High Cost of Living

While there are no easy fixes due to uncontrollable economic factors, individuals can manage what they can control and hope for better economic conditions and effective government solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Destinations like Thailand, Portugal, or Mexico are accessible to Canadians with a reliable internet connection and careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Outlook

Despite the challenges, Canada's core values and economy are still worth investing in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. There is hope that the government will implement effective strategies to control the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Inflation also appears to be cooling off slightly, suggesting potential relief on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

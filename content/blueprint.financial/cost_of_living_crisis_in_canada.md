Canada is currently experiencing a significant cost of living crisis, with approximately 50% of Canadians living paycheck to paycheck, according to Equifax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Social media platforms are reportedly filled with individuals expressing their struggles to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A recent poll by Angus Reid indicates that a shocking 40% of recent immigrants are considering moving to another province or [[reasons_canadians_are_leaving_canada | leaving Canada entirely]], primarily due to the high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Rising Costs of Everyday Items

Canadians are facing increasing prices for essential goods and services.

### Food
The cost of food has seen a substantial increase. David Olive noted in the Toronto Star that a basket of 18 household items costing $82 in March 2021 now costs $113.32, representing a 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The latest [[changes_in_grocery_bill_for_canadians_in_2025 | Canada Food Price Report]] predicts an increase of about $711 in the average family of four's annual food bill this year, bringing the total to an average of $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This follows a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Food prices have significantly outpaced the average rate of inflation in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Rental and Housing Costs
Shelter costs are another major concern. In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month; by July 2024, it had risen to $3,648 per month, a 40% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The average cost to buy a house in Canada was $413,000 in 2015, but by May 2024, this average had skyrocketed to $699,000, a staggering 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Other Costs
Beyond food and shelter, costs for transportation, entertainment, and general everyday items have also increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Rampant inflation has made it difficult for many Canadians to manage their bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Income Growth Versus Cost of Living
Unfortunately, income growth has not kept pace with the rising cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. According to Stat Canada, the median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals in 2022 was $70,500, a decrease from $73,000 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Average wages are unlikely to have increased sufficiently in 2023 or 2024 to match inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs have further strained finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Impact on Canadians
The financial struggles have led to widespread unhappiness, particularly among Canadian youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While Canada ranks 15th happiest overall in the Gallup World Poll's latest World Happiness Report, Canadians under 30 fall significantly lower to 58th, highlighting a stark disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Many Canadians are considering relocating internally; 28% are contemplating moving from their current province due to high housing costs, with young adults and renters being the most inclined to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This trend is particularly evident in Ontario and British Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Alberta has become a popular relocation spot, with 18% of Canadians considering a move there for more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Between 2022 and 2023, net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Strategies to Combat the High Cost of Living

While many issues stem from uncontrollable economic factors, individuals can focus on managing what they can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The two main approaches are to earn more money or to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Out-of-the-Box Solutions

*   **Tiny Houses:** Consider living in compact homes (200-400 sq ft) to save on housing costs and embrace a minimalist lifestyle. Examples include Mint Tiny House Company in Vancouver and Minimalist Houses in Quebec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Digital Nomads:** With the rise of remote work, individuals can live and work from more [[countries_where_canadians_can_live_affordably | affordable locations abroad]] temporarily or part-time, such as Thailand, Portugal, or Mexico. This can significantly reduce living expenses compared to Canada, requiring only a reliable internet connection and careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

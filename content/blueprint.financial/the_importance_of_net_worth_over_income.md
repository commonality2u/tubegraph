While many individuals prioritize income as a measure of financial success, net worth is the true determinant of financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## Defining Net Worth
Net worth is calculated as the total value of what you own (assets) minus what you owe (debts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Assets** include cash, investments, and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Debts** include mortgages, loans, and credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

An individual earning $250,000 annually but spending it all will be worse off in the long run than someone making $80,000 who invests wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Why Net Worth Matters

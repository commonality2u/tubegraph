The [[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_changes | CPP enhancements]] for 2025 introduce significant changes for business owners, primarily through increased contribution thresholds that will impact payroll costs and cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These updates maintain two levels of contributions: regular CPP up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) and CPP2 up to the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Business owners will likely need to pay these contributions for their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Updated Contribution Thresholds for 2025

For 2025, the YMPE has increased to $71,500, up from $69,700 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The YAMPE, which determines the range for CPP2, has risen to $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Contribution Rates for 2025

The updated contributions work as follows for 2025:

*   **Regular CPP Contributions**:
    *   Calculated at a rate of **5.95%** on income up to the YMPE of $71,500 for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   This amount is matched by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
    *   Self-employed individuals pay both portions, totaling **11.9%** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **CPP2 Contributions**:
    *   Applied to income between $71,400 and $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   The rate is **4%** for employees, which is also matched by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Self-employed individuals pay **8%** for this portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

> [!example] Self-Employed Contribution Example
> A self-employed person earning over $81,300 in 2025 will contribute a total of $8,888 to their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This total includes both the employee and employer portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Purpose and Economic Implications

These [[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_changes | changes]] aim to improve retirement security by gradually increasing the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

While this is beneficial for future retirement security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, the higher contribution rates mean extra costs for employers and self-employed individuals today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. For businesses with multiple employees, these increases could have a noticeable [[economic_implications_of_cpp_changes | impact on payroll expenses and cash flows]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Strategies for Businesses

Small businesses may need to adjust their budgets to account for higher payroll costs or explore more tax-efficient ways to compensate employees and reduce financial strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Having a solid financial plan is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

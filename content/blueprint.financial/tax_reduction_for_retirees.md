Many Canadian retirees can significantly cut their tax bill by implementing a simple strategy involving their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach aims to reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and ultimately lead to a more comfortable retirement by retaining more of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A common mistake among retirees is not properly managing their RSP withdrawals, often leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This is often linked to unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Out of all Canadians holding a TFSA, only 8.66% manage to max out their contributions, indicating that the vast majority are missing out on incredible tax-free growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For retirees, this issue is particularly pronounced, with many entering retirement with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% of them maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before dropping slightly to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

While RSPs are excellent for saving during working years, they come with a catch: every dollar withdrawn is taxed as income, potentially pushing you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Furthermore, at age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates that you convert your RSP into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) and begin making withdrawals, whether you need the money or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

If you find yourself withdrawing more from your RSP/RRIF than you immediately need for living expenses, the strategy is to contribute those excess funds into your TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This can save thousands of dollars in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, a 71-year-old who has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In his 30% tax bracket, this means $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 of this for his living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions cover most of his costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Instead of putting this excess income into a normal savings account or taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Assuming a 6% average annual return, here's how Eddie's TFSA grows:

*   **Year 1**: $10,000 contributed grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years**: Each year, Eddie adds another $10,000, and compounding accelerates the growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years**: Eddie has contributed $100,000, and his TFSA has grown to approximately $132,000â€”all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### The Contrast: Non-Registered Account

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would still grow at a 6% annual rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. However, with 30% of the gains lost to taxes each year, his effective growth rate would drop to around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. After 10 years, his non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after accounting for taxes, significantly less than the $132,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. If he had put it into a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the amount would be much lower, closer to $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways from Eddie's Example

By consistently contributing his excess RRIF income to his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Achieves a TFSA balance of $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account or roughly $55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Maximizes his retirement savings and gains the flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or leave them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

>[!TIP] Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a chunk of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

>[!CAUTION] Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of a property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Does this Eliminate RSP Taxes on Withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals will still be considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can effectively [[reducing_taxes_with_the_canada_workers_benefit_and_other_credits | reduce your taxable income]] and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as [[managing_higher_tax_burden_in_retirement | OAS clawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The key is to minimize the tax impact while maximizing your overall [[supplemental_income_strategies_for_retirees | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Your retirement savings should be working for you, not the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

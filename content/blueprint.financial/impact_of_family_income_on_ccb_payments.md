The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a significant financial support system for families in Canada, designed to help cover the costs of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While the average cost of raising a child in Canada can be as high as $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, the CCB can provide up to $125,500 per child, tax-free, over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, the amount a family receives is directly impacted by their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Understanding the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The CCB is a tax-free payment provided to families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It is indexed to inflation, meaning the payment amounts grow over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Importantly, it is completely tax-free, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Families can use the CCB funds for any needs, including food, housing, or education, without restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

In 2021 alone, it helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## How Family Income Affects Payments

[[canada_child_benefit_ccb_eligibility_and_calculations | CCB payments]] are determined by a family's **adjusted family net income (AFNI)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. For married or common-law couples, this is the combined income of both partners, minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The fundamental principle is that **as your net income increases, your CCB decreases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced payments, or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Reduction Stages

The reduction in CCB payments occurs in two stages based on a family's net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>:

1.  **First Stage**: If your AFNI is between $36,525 and $79,000, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The maximum reduction in this stage is about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
2.  **Second Stage**: If your AFNI is above approximately $79,000 (after the initial reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over this $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Examples of Income-Based Reductions

For a single child under six, the benefit gradually decreases as income rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>:

*   **$35,000 or less**: Families receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year, or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **$50,000 net income**: The annual benefit is reduced to about $6,840, or approximately $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **$100,000 family net income**: The annual benefit drops significantly to around $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **$130,000 family net income**: The benefit further reduces to about $1,814 per year, or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Ultimately, at very high income levels, the benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB has the potential to cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Calculating Your Specific Benefit

For precise calculations, especially with multiple children, it is recommended to use the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) CCB calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If you encounter issues, contacting the CRA directly can be helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Keeping Information Up-to-Date

It is crucial to keep your information current with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. If your family's income changes due to events like job loss, marriage, or divorce, updating the CRA immediately could qualify you for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Similarly, changes in shared custody arrangements should be reported, as benefits are typically split 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

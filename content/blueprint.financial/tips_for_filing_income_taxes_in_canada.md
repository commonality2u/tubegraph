Many Canadians miss out on hundreds of available tax deductions and credits annually, leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offers a vast number of tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide highlights some of the most frequently overlooked tax breaks and offers strategies to ensure you claim everything you're entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Overlooked Tax Breaks

### Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)
The CWB is designed to assist low-income Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An estimated 240,000 eligible individuals do not claim it annually, resulting in $175 million unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The application process can be complicated, and many are unaware of their eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Paper filing exacerbates this issue, with only half of paper filers claiming the benefit compared to those using tax software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Pension Income Splitting
If you are retired and your spouse is in a lower [[tax_brackets_in_canada | tax bracket]], [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | pension income splitting]] can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This strategy allows you to transfer up to 50% of your pension income to your spouse, thereby lowering the total household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. To claim this, you must complete form T1032 with your tax return each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> If nearing retirement, begin planning early to strategically adjust pension withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Moving Expenses Deduction
You may deduct moving expenses if you moved at least 40 km closer to a new job or school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Eligible expenses include travel, storage, and temporary accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Many individuals miss this deduction because they fail to track their receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Moving costs can only be deducted against income earned at the new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If you moved but haven't started work or school, you'll need to wait to claim the deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Spousal RRSP Contributions
Couples can use spousal [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | RRSP]] contributions to spread out retirement income and reduce future taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. If one spouse earns significantly more, contributing to a spousal [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | RRSP]] allows for an immediate tax deduction while the withdrawals are taxed at the lower-earning spouse's rate in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Home Buyer Amount
First-time home buyers may be eligible for the Home Buyer's Amount, a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. As of 2022, eligible buyers can claim up to $10,000, translating to a tax reduction of up to $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Home Office Expense Deduction
With the increase in remote work, employees and [[tax_tips_for_selfemployed_canadians | self-employed individuals]] can deduct expenses related to their home workspace, such as rent, utilities, and internet costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In the 2023 tax season, Canadians claimed $2.08 billion in home office expenses, a 41% increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Tuition and Education Credits
Students can claim these credits to offset post-secondary education costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Unused credits can be transferred to a spouse, parent, or grandparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The credit applies to post-secondary tuition fees from CRA-designated schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Child Care Expense Deduction
Parents can deduct costs for daycare, nannies, and certain educational programs up to a specified limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This deduction must typically be claimed by the lower-income spouse and only applies to expenses incurred to allow a parent to work, study, or run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Charitable Donations Tax Credit
Donating to registered charities can provide a tax credit of up to 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Unused donations can be carried forward for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Many Canadians forget to claim these donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Gather all your donation receipts in one place to avoid scrambling at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Student Loan Interest Credit
Interest paid on government student loans is eligible for a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Many graduates overlook this, partly because financial institutions may not send automatic interest statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This credit can be carried forward for up to five years if not claimed in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This credit applies exclusively to government student loans, not private loans or lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC)
Seniors or individuals with disabilities can claim the HATC for renovations that improve home accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. You can claim up to $20,000 in eligible expenses, providing a 15% tax credit, up to a maximum benefit of $3,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Renters's Tax Credit
Some provinces offer tax credits to renters to help offset housing costs, subject to specific criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Ontario:** The Ontario Trillium Benefit (OTB) considers rent, income, and age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Manitoba:** Renters can claim up to $525 annually via the Education Property Tax Credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Quebec:** Offers a solidarity tax credit with a housing component for low-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Work from Home:** Part of your rent may be deductible as a home office expense under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Keep all receipts, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Eligible Dependent Amount
If you are single, divorced, or widowed and support a dependent, you may qualify for the eligible dependent amount, a non-refundable tax credit that can significantly reduce taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. To qualify, the dependent must be a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, or sister who is either under 18 or has a physical or mental impairment, and must have lived with you in your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Tutoring Services Tax Credit
If your child has a learning disability, tutoring expenses may be claimed as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. A medical practitioner must certify in writing that these services are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The tutoring must be provided by someone in the business of offering such services and not related to the student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Meals and Entertainment Deduction
[[simple_tax_deductions_for_canadian_small_businesses | Self-employed individuals]] can deduct 50% of eligible meals and entertainment expenses incurred for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Meticulous record-keeping is crucial for claiming these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Proper documentation is important to support claims in case of an audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Carrying Charges Deduction
[[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | Investors]] can deduct fees paid for investment advice and interest on loans used to earn investment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Reviewing financial statements and consulting a tax professional can help identify and claim these expenses, reducing taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. For example, investment management fees can often be written off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## How to File Taxes for Free and Never Miss a Tax Break

Filing your taxes doesn't have to cost money, and the right tools can automatically flag missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

*   **Use Free Tax Software**: Programs like Wealthsimple Tax and TurboTax Free can identify missing credits and deductions and guide you through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

*   **Use Autofill**: Many tax programs can directly pull your tax slips (e.g., T4s, [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | RRSP]] contributions) from the CRA, reducing errors and ensuring nothing is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Best Way to Stop Forgetting Tax Breaks

Most people miss tax deductions not due to unawareness or ineligibility, but because they forget to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The key is to implement simple systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

*   **Use a Receipt Scanning App**: Apps like Expensify or QuickBooks can automatically track receipts by scanning them with your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Make a Tax Receipts Email Folder**: Create a dedicated email folder for tax-related documents that arrive via email, possibly a separate one for each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Keep a Quick Tax Deductions Checklist**: Before filing each year, review a simple checklist. For example, "Did I claim my home office? Medical expenses? Investment fees?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. A quick review can save hundreds or thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This can be maintained in a spreadsheet and updated annually based on new learnings from an accountant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

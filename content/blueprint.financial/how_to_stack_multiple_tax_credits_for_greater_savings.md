The tax deadline is April 30th, and failing to claim available credits can mean leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canada offers numerous tax credits, and many people miss out on significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While individual credits are important, the key to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing your savings]] is by stacking multiple credits together for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Many Canadians don't realize how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Retirement Tax Savings Combo

For retirees, combining specific credits can lead to substantial [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

*   **Pension Income Amount**
    *   Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Tax Credit**
    *   Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the age amount tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
    *   For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   The credit is gradually reduced if net income exceeds around $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This tax break helps retirees keep more of their money while managing taxable income efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Bonus Tip: [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_couples | Pension income splitting]]**
    *   [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_couples | Pension income splitting]] allows couples to allocate eligible pension income for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   This strategy can save even more by shifting income into a spouse's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Example: John and Linda

Consider John and Linda, both retired and over 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

*   They can each claim the **Pension Income Amount** to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   John also qualifies for the **Age Amount Credit**, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   By stacking these: Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Family Tax Saving Combo

Families can combine multiple tax credits and deductions to reduce taxes and increase their refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**
    *   The CCB provides tax-free monthly payments to help families with the cost of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   For 2025, parents can receive up to $7,997 per child under six and $674 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   This benefit is income-tested, meaning payments phase out as family income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**
    *   You can claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)**
    *   The CCA provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   For 2025, eligible individuals can claim $8,619 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For a child under 18 with a disability, the credit amount is $2,861 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income, and eligibility varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Bonus Tip: [[strategies_for_family_tax_savings_and_income_splitting | Spousal RRSP contributions]]**
    *   Families can also [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_couples | split income]] by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Example: Sarah and Mike

Sarah and Mike have two young kids, who are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   They receive **Canada Child Benefits** as tax-free monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Mike claims **Child Care Expenses Deduction** for daycare, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Since one child has a disability, they get an extra tax credit from the **Canada Caregiver Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Stacking these: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

## Other Stackable Credits

*   **Medical Expenses Tax Credit** can be combined with **Home Accessibility Expenses** for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   Home accessibility expenses allow seniors and persons with disabilities to claim up to $20,000 in home renovation expenses to improve accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This credit reduces taxes by up to $3,000 (15% of $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   The [[calculation_of_medical_expense_tax_credits | Medical Expenses Tax Credit]] helps Canadians offset out-of-pocket healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

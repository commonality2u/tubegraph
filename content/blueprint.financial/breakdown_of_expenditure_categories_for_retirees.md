Understanding monthly spending is a common concern for individuals [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | planning their retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article breaks down the [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average spending for Canadian retirees]], what they spend their money on, and how spending patterns can change during different retirement phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Average Annual Spending

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which breaks down to $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Key Expenditure Categories

For retirees in Canada, expenditures are primarily allocated across several key categories:

### Shelter
Shelter represents the largest portion of spending, covering the cost of main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Average Annual Spend**: Around $13,814 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   **Average Monthly Spend**: $1,151 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   **Percentage of Monthly Spending**: 22.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> (about a quarter)
*   Even though many retirees own their homes, they still incur significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses even after mortgages are paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Food
Food is another significant expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, encompassing both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Average Annual Spend**: About $7,667 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   **Average Monthly Spend**: $639 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   **Percentage of Monthly Spending**: 12.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

### Transportation
While transportation costs are generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, they still represent a notable portion of the budget.
*   **Percentage of Monthly Spending**: 8.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Costs decrease as work-related travel declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Healthcare
Despite free healthcare in Canada, retirees allocate a higher percentage to healthcare due to increased medical needs as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Monthly Spending**: 5.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>

### Personal Insurance and Pensions
This category highlights the ongoing need for financial security in retirement.
*   **Percentage of Monthly Spending**: 5.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

### Household Operations
These expenses cover the costs associated with maintaining the home.
*   **Percentage of Monthly Spending**: 5.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

## Real-World Spending Insights

Based on observations from clients, retirement spending patterns vary widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Average Range**: Retirees typically spend anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000 or $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **High-End Households**: Can spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Extreme Variances**: Some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and gradually decreases, similar to [[changes_in_spending_during_different_retirement_phases | the three phases of retirement spending]] (high, medium, and low spending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This reduction is attributed to factors like lower housing costs, less need for transportation, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Implications for Retirement Planning

Understanding these spending trends and categories is crucial for [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. By anticipating changes in spending habits, individuals can ensure they have enough saved to cover all their needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

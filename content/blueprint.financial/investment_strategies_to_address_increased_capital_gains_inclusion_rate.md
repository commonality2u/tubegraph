Big tax updates in 2025 are reshaping how business owners in Canada can plan and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These changes aim to minimize taxes, protect cash flow, and allow more funds to be invested back into businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## [[Capital gains tax changes | Capital Gains Tax for Business Owners (2025)]]

The year 2025 marks Canada's first full year with a new [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains tax]] structure for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The inclusion rate for corporations has increased from 50% to 66.67% (or 2/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This means a larger portion of a corporation's [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] is now subject to taxation, impacting after-tax profits, investment decisions, and financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For example, if ABC Corp. sells an investment property in 2025 for a [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gain]] of $200,000:
*   **Under old rules (50% inclusion):** $100,000 would be included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. At a 10% corporate tax rate, the tax owed would be $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Under 2025 rules (66.67% inclusion):** Approximately $133,000 would be included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. At the same 10% corporate tax rate, the tax owed increases to $13,334 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

This results in an extra tax liability of $3,334 compared to the old rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This increase significantly impacts businesses that rely on [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]], such as those investing in real estate or securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. It's important to note that these changes do not affect sole proprietors and self-employed individuals, who will still be taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### [[Tax efficient investment strategies | Planning Strategies for the New Inclusion Rate]]

Here are two key [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_amidst_tax_changes | strategies]] for business owners to address the new [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] inclusion rate:

1.  **Reassessing Investment Portfolios** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
    *   Businesses investing in high-growth assets or stocks that generate significant [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] will face higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   A simpler option might be to switch to Canadian stocks that pay dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Dividends often come with tax perks, such as the ability to recover some tax through a mechanism called Refundable Dividend Tax On Hand (RDIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For example, if a business earns $50,000 from high-growth stocks, two-thirds will be taxable, but switching to a dividend-paying Canadian stock could allow more tax recovery through RDIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This strategy requires careful planning and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

2.  **Contributing to an Individual Pension Plan (IPP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
    *   IPPs are a [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies | tax-efficient retirement planning tool]] for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Contributions are tax-deductible from corporate income, which can help offset taxable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   This [[investment_strategies_and_account_optimization | strategy]] not only reduces immediate tax liabilities but also builds a solid retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   IPPs are similar to having an RRSP for a corporation but offer higher limits and more flexibility for succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Other Important Tax and Business Updates

### CPP 2025 Enhancement and Contribution Updates

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) enhancements in 2025 bring increased contribution thresholds that will impact payroll costs and cash flows for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These updates maintain two levels of contributions:
*   **Regular CPP:** Up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For 2025, the YMPE has increased to $71,500 (from $69,700 in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Contributions are calculated at 5.95% on income up to this threshold for employees, matched by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Self-employed individuals pay both portions for a total of 11.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **CPP2:** Up to the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. For 2025, the YAMPE has risen to $81,300 (from $73,200 in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Contributions apply to income between $71,400 and $81,300 at a rate of 4% for employees, matched by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Self-employed individuals pay 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

A self-employed person earning over $81,300 in 2025 will contribute a total of $8,888 to their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While these changes aim to improve retirement security by gradually increasing the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% over 40 years, the higher contribution rates mean extra costs for employers and self-employed individuals today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Small businesses may need to adjust budgets or explore smarter [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies | tax-efficient ways]] to compensate employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase_in_2025 | Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)]]

For 2025, the [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase_in_2025 | LCGE]] limit has increased to $1.25 million, up from approximately $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This allows individuals to shield a portion of [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For instance, selling a qualified small business for $1.25 million in 2025 could potentially exempt the entire [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gain]] from individual tax, depending on the remaining LCGE limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The LCGE is available to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their portion of the gains, significantly reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)

The CEI provides tax relief for business owners by reducing the [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] inclusion rate to 1/3 or 33.33% on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This incentive is being phased in gradually, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching the full $2 million cap by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

For example, a small business owner with a $100,000 taxable [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gain]] would only include $33,600 in taxable income under the CEI, compared to $66,500 without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While the CEI reduces the inclusion rate, it does not address investment income taxation, which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. For many business owners, the previously mentioned [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase_in_2025 | LCGE]] remains a more effective tool as it offers a complete exemption for eligible [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]], especially when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Strategically allocating gains across shareholders can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Combining [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_amidst_tax_changes | strategies]] like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Electronic Filing Requirements

Starting in 2025, new CRA rules require businesses filing six or more information returns (such as T4s or T5s) to file electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Corporations with over $1 million in revenue must also submit T2 returns online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Smaller businesses using manual methods will need to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Credit Card Transaction Fee Reductions (Bonus Change)

Starting October 19, 2024, eligible small business owners will see credit card transaction fees drop by up to 27% under new agreements with Visa and MasterCard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This initiative is expected to save eligible businesses around $1 billion over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Over 90% of credit card-accepting businesses will qualify for reduced fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, with in-store transaction rates dropping to an annual average of 0.95% and online transactions seeing up to a 7% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. To qualify, businesses must meet annual sales thresholds (under $300,000 for Visa and under $175,000 for MasterCard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

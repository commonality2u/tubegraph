Canadians considering [[financial_planning_for_international_retirement | retiring abroad]] need to understand how their government income streams, such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), are affected when they move outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The rules for each benefit vary significantly, impacting what gets paid, what gets taxed, and what stops entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): Not Portable

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit designed to support low-income seniors who live in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Cessation of Benefits**: If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **No Treaty Protection**: There are no social security agreements that protect your GIS payments; it is strictly tied to your physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Case Example (Gan)**: Gan, a 71-year-old retiree receiving CPP and GIS, found her GIS terminated a few months after moving to Mexico because she was outside Canada for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Planning Tip**: If GIS is a crucial part of your [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement income]], consider delaying your move, adjusting your budget, or exploring other income options to replace the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Residency Trick**: Some retirees maintain part-year residency in Canada, often referred to as "snowbirds," ensuring they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year to keep their healthcare and tax status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP): Portable with Tax Considerations

Your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits are based on your contributions during your working life in Canada, not on your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Portability**: CPP benefits will travel with you, meaning the amount you receive remains the same whether you live in Canada or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Case Example (Linda)**: Linda, who worked in Toronto for 35 years and paid into CPP, will continue to receive her CPP payments unchanged after retiring to Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **[[tax_implications_for_canadian_benefits_abroad | Tax Implications]]**:
    *   **Withholding Tax**: CPP payments may be subject to withholding tax if you are considered a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Tax Treaties**: A tax treaty between Canada and your new country can reduce or even eliminate this tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. For example, moving to the US, a tax treaty means you may avoid withholding tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   **Social Security Agreements**: Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries, which help avoid double contributions, ensure CPP coverage continues, and coordinate benefits if you worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Other Benefits**: CPP survivor benefits or child benefits also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Payment Methods**: Payments can be direct deposited into a Canadian bank account, received in local currency through a local bank in many countries, or mailed as a check in Canadian dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Local Tax Laws**: Your new country might tax these payments differently, so it's advisable to check local tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS): Residency-Based

Old Age Security (OAS) is based on residency, not work history or contributions like CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

*   **Qualification Rule**: To receive OAS while living outside of Canada, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If this threshold is met, your monthly OAS payment will continue, even if living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Case Example (Pedro)**: Pedro, who lived in Canada for 30 years after moving at age 25, continues to receive his full OAS payments after retiring to Spain because he met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Suspension**: If you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months, your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and reestablish residency to receive it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Social Security Agreements (OAS)**: You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country with a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time lived in both countries is at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Note that years lived in another country only help determine qualification, not increase your OAS amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **[[tax_implications_for_canadian_benefits_abroad | Tax Implications]]**:
    *   **Taxable Income**: OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Withholding Tax**: OAS may be subject to a non-resident withholding tax, with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   **Tax Treaties**: A tax treaty can reduce or eliminate this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example, the Canada-US tax treaty means OAS is not subject to withholding tax for those moving to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, the Canada-Germany tax treaty allows Canada to tax public pensions like OAS up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    *   **Tax Filing**: You'll receive an NR4 tax slip annually and must continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback**: To manage the OAS recovery tax (clawback), which begins at $93,454 in 2025, consider strategies like RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Planning Strategies for Expats

Consider the following when [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | planning your retirement abroad]]:

*   **Case Example (Anita)**: Anita, 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years in Canada.
    *   Her CPP continues without interruption, with a reduced 15% withholding tax thanks to the tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   Her OAS continues because she met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   Her GIS stopped after 6 months, as it requires ongoing Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Anita's smart moves included delaying her move until she hit 20 years residency, choosing a treaty country, and planning early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Government Benefits as "Travel Companions"

*   **CPP (Ride or Die Friend)**: Your CPP is loyal and goes everywhere with you, but watch out for potential taxes at your destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **OAS (Selective Friend)**: OAS will only come if you built a strong relationship (20+ years of living in Canada after age 18) or have "mutual friends" in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **GIS (Canada Lover)**: GIS is generous while you're in Canada, but it will stop completely if you leave for more than 6 months, with no treaty or workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Additional Pro Tips

*   Consider drawing down your RRSPs before becoming a non-resident to optimize [[tax_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | tax planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Plan for private healthcare, as provincial coverage typically ends after 6 to 7 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Investors work hard for their money and expect it to grow, but [[hidden_investment_fees_in_canada | hidden fees]] can quietly take thousands of dollars away without most investors realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Two significant categories of these fees are those associated with segregated funds and various trading costs.

## Segregated Funds: Insanely High Fees

Segregated funds (seg funds) are often promoted as safe, insurance-protected investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They combine elements of mutual funds and life insurance policies, offering principal protection guarantees after a set period, typically 10 or more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. However, this perceived safety comes at a massive cost in fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Cost of Seg Funds

The Management Expense Ratios (MERs) for seg funds often exceed 3% annually, and can even approach 4%, which is significantly higher than standard [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

For example:
*   The RBC Emerging Markets Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund (a seg fund) has an MER of 2.94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   The Manulife Global Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund (also a seg fund) has an MER of 3.69% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   In contrast, a low-cost ETF like the iShares TSX Indexed ETF has an MER of just 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

#### Impact on Returns
Consider investing $100,000:
*   In a seg fund with a 3.5% MER, earning 6% annually before fees, your net return would only be 2.5% per year. After 20 years, your investment would grow to approximately $163,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   The same investment in a low-cost ETF with a 0.06% MER would grow to about $317,000 over 20 years, nearly double the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### How to Spot a Segregated Fund
Many investors may not realize they own a segregated fund until they are already locked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Key indicators found in the fund facts document include:
1.  **Maturity Guarantee**: Often 75% or 100% of your principal after 10 or 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
2.  **Higher MERs**: Typically above or close to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
3.  **Estate Planning Benefits**: Includes provisions for estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
4.  **Early Withdrawal Penalties**: May have surrender charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

If an advisor offers a fund with these features, it's advisable to ask directly if it's a seg fund and request full details on fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### When Seg Funds Might Make Sense
There are a few niche cases where seg funds might be beneficial:
*   **Estate Planning**: Assets go directly to beneficiaries, avoiding probate delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Creditor Protection**: Business owners can protect assets from lawsuits or bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

:::info Pro Tip
If insurance benefits are absolutely necessary, consider a term life insurance policy combined with a low-cost ETF instead. This often proves much cheaper than segregated funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Trading Fees: The Cost of Buying and Selling

Trading fees can quietly erode investment returns, especially for frequent traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. These costs primarily come in two forms: brokerage fees and the bid-ask spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Brokerage Fees
Many Canadian brokerages charge a flat fee per trade, usually between $5 and $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This means every time you buy or sell a stock or ETF, you pay an extra cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. For active traders, these fees accumulate quickly. For example, making 10 trades per month at $9.99 per trade amounts to nearly $1,200 a year in fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Some actively managed [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual funds]] also impose short-term trading fees if sold within a specific period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Bid-Ask Spread
The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (the bid) and the lowest price a seller is asking for (the ask) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, if you buy an ETF at $20.10 (ask) and later sell it at $20 (bid), you lose 10 cents per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This hidden cost is more pronounced in lower-volume stocks and ETFs, which typically have wider spreads, making them more expensive to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### How to Reduce Trading Fees
*   **Use Low-Cost or Commission-Free Brokers**: Platforms like Wealthsimple Trade or Questrade offer commission-free trading for ETFs and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Minimize Frequent Trading**: Stick to a long-term investment strategy to avoid excessive transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This is especially relevant for [[high_volume_trading_in_tfsa | high volume trading in TFSA]].
*   **Use Limit Orders**: Instead of market orders, use limit orders to control your buy and sell pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Trade High Volume ETFs and Stocks**: This helps reduce the impact of the bid-ask spread losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Early Redemption Fees: Costly Exit Penalties

Some [[high_fees_associated_on_canadian_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] and investment products charge early redemption fees if you sell too soon after buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These fees, often called short-term trading fees, are designed to discourage quick turnover and protect fund stability, but they can significantly reduce your investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Where You'll Find Early Redemption Fees
Generally, [[tax_inefficiencies_of_mutual_funds_in_taxable_accounts | mutual funds]] charge these fees if sold within 30 to 90 days, typically ranging from 1% to 2% of the investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

For example, the RBC US Equity Fund has a short-term trading fee of 2% of the value of units sold or switched within 7 days of buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### How to Avoid Early Redemption Fees
*   **Review Fund Policies**: Always check the fund's short-term trading policies in the fund facts document before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Hold Investments Longer**: Avoid triggering these penalties by holding investments for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Consider ETFs**: Most ETFs do not charge early redemption fees, making them a more flexible alternative for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

[[impact_of_high_fees_on_investment_returns | Hidden fees]] and taxes can chip away at your wealth, but understanding and managing them through smart choices can help protect your money and build long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

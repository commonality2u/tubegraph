While Canada offers public healthcare, out-of-pocket medical expenses can still be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows Canadians to claim some of these costs through the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This credit helps reduce your taxable income and can lead to a larger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## How the Medical Expense Tax Credit Works

The METC allows Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Claiming Medical Expenses

To claim medical expenses, you must enter them on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Calculation of the Medical Expense Tax Credit

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. From your total eligible expenses, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 for 2024 expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

**Example**:
Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her $50,000 net income is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% of net income) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, reducing her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Eligible Medical Expenses

Many common medical costs can be claimed, helping you recoup some expenses at tax time.

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

Eligible prescription drugs and medications must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Marijuana**: Covered if you have a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase it from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Ineligible**: Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements are generally not covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

**Example**:
Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   3% of her $60,000 income is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $3,000 (total expenses) - $1,800 (3% of net income) = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

*Pro Tip*: Keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Many dental and vision costs are tax deductible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Eligible Expenses**: Services provided by licensed professionals like dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This includes routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Ineligible**: Purely cosmetic procedures (e.g., teeth whitening) and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Example**:
Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $4,500 ($150,000 * 3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   The set threshold for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 from his total medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   He can claim $3,100 (total expenses) - $2,759 (threshold) = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*Pro Tip*: Higher income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period (e.g., laser eye surgery and a root canal) to maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### [[medical_travel_expenses_and_tax_deductions | Medical Travel Expenses]]

If you travel for medical care, you may be able to claim travel costs as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Eligibility**: Applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Additional Claims**: If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Eligible Costs**: Public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights), vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance), lodging (hotel, Airbnb), and meals (for extended stays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

**Example**:
Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. She spent $800 on gas and parking, and $1,500 on meals and accommodations, for a total of $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,650 ($55,000 * 3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,300 (total expenses) - $1,650 (3% of net income) = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   Jennifer can claim $650 of expenses on her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

*Pro Tip*: If a medical practitioner certifies you need assistance while traveling, you can claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: Includes plans that cover medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Ineligible**: Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed**: Premiums for self-employed individuals can be claimed as long as they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Family Plans**: May allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children to maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

**Example**:
Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $2,700 ($90,000 * 3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   His eligible claim is $3,500 (total premiums) - $2,700 (3% of net income) = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

*Pro Tip*: If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, verify which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Many medical devices and equipment qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Eligible Items**: Wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Home Modifications**: In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Prescription Requirement**: Some devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify, so keep both the prescription and receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance costs (e.g., batteries for hearing aids, CPAP filters) may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Example**:
Emily earns $65,000 and buys a CPAP machine for $2,500 for her sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,950 ($65,000 * 3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,950 (3% of net income) = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

*Pro Tip*: If making a large medical purchase, ensure it is on the CRA's list of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible medical devices]] to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

Properly claiming medical expenses for your family can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

**Example**:
Richard and Pauline, a Canadian couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), incurred the following medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   Total: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard and Pauline's for Line 33099 ($2,500 + $2,000 + $1,800 = $6,300) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Rob's expenses must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Let's calculate the eligible claim for Richard and Pauline for the combined $6,300:
*   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Richard**: Only earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*Pro Tip*: Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. By organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim, you can maximize tax savings when [[filing_canadian_taxes_for_free | filing your return]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

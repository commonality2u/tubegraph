While doctor and dentist visits can be costly, even with Canada's healthcare system, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to claim some of these medical costs on their taxes, helping keep more money in their pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide will walk you through common medical expenses that can be claimed and strategies to maximize your refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work in Canada

[[Medical expenses deduction in Canada | Claiming medical expenses]] on a tax return can be intricate, but understanding the process is key to maximizing your refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC)

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) allows Canadians to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

To claim it, you must enter medical expenses on specific lines:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> [!example] Calculation Example: Jessica
> Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
> *   3% of her income is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% of income) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
> *   Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, reducing her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Medical Expenses You Can Claim

Many medical costs, even those beyond basic doctor visits, can be tax deductible.

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

Prescribed drugs and medications can be a significant expense, and some costs may be recouped at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   [[Eligible medical expenses for tax deductions in Canada | Eligible prescription drugs]] and medications must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Medical marijuana is covered, but with conditions: you need a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and must purchase it from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

> [!example] Calculation Example: Sarah
> Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spends $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($60,000) is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $3,000 (total expenses) - $1,800 (3% of income) = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
> *   Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> Keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Dental and vision expenses can quickly accumulate, but many of these costs are tax deductible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   You can claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | eligible expenses]] for services provided by licensed professionals, including dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Covered expenses include routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Purely cosmetic procedures (e.g., teeth whitening) and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> [!example] Calculation Example: Alex (High Earner)
> Alex earns $150,000 per year and spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
> *   3% of his income is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
> *   The set threshold amount for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
> *   Since $2,759 is the lower of these two amounts, Alex subtracts that from his total medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
> *   He can claim $3,100 (total expenses) - $2,759 (threshold) = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> Higher income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions (e.g., laser eye surgery and a root canal in the same year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Medical Travel Expenses

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This applies if you must travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   [[Guidelines for claiming medical travel expenses and private insurance premiums | Eligible travel expenses]] include:
    *   Public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Lodging (hotel, Airbnb) and meals when required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> [!example] Calculation Example: Jennifer
> Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over 3 months, spending $800 on gas and parking and $1,500 on meals and accommodations, for a total of $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,300 (total expenses) - $1,650 (3% of income) = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
> *   Jennifer can claim $650 of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out of pocket for [[Guidelines for claiming medical travel expenses and private insurance premiums | private health insurance]], you may be able to deduct the premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   This includes plans that cover medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed as long as they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children, which can help maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

> [!example] Calculation Example: Mark
> Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
> *   3% of his income is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,500 (total expenses) - $2,700 (3% of income) = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
> *   Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> If you're paying for a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, check which portion of your premiums is eligible and ensure you keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Medical devices and equipment can be costly, but many of these expenses qualify as tax deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   You can claim items such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces, and in some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Some medical devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify, so keeping a record of both the prescription and the receipt is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   If the device requires ongoing maintenance (e.g., batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters), these costs may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

> [!example] Calculation Example: Emily
> Emily earns $65,000 and buys a CPAP machine for $2,500 for her sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($65,000) is $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,950 (3% of income) = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
> *   Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. While this amount may seem small, combining it with other medical expenses could increase her total deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> If you're making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it's on the CRA's list of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | eligible medical devices]] to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

Properly claiming medical expenses for your family can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents, but knowing who should claim them can boost your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

> [!example] Family Optimization Example: Richard and Pauline
> Richard and Pauline are a Canadian couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
> Their medical expenses were:
> *   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
> *   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
> *   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
> *   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
> *   **Total**: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard's and Pauline's, making $6,300 ($2,500 + $2,000 + $1,800) eligible for Line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

**Option 1: Pauline Claims (Income $55,000)**
*   3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

**Option 2: Richard Claims (Income $42,000)**
*   3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   His eligible claim is $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income for the primary medical expenses. They may get a bigger deduction due to the 3% net income threshold being lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. By organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim, you can maximize tax savings when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Understanding [[lesserknown_canadian_tax_deductions | medical expense tax deductions]] and applying smart financial strategies are key to building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

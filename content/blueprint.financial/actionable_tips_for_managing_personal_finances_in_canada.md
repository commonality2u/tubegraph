Canada is currently experiencing a significant cost of living crisis, with about 50% of Canadians living paycheck to paycheck, according to Equifax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Social media reflects widespread struggles, and a shocking 40% of recent immigrants are considering moving to another province or leaving Canada entirely, primarily due to the high cost of living, as per a recent Angus Reid poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Rising Cost of Living in Canada

Canadians are experiencing frustration due to rapidly increasing prices for everyday items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Groceries
David Olive noted in the Toronto Star that a basket of 18 household items costing $82 in March 2021, cost $113.32 today, representing a 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The latest Canada Food Price Report predicts a $701 increase in the average family of four's annual food bill this year, bringing the total to an average of $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This follows a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Food prices have significantly outpaced the average rate of inflation in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Rental and Housing Costs
Rent is another major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month; by July 2024, it averaged $3,648 per month, a 40% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This means essential costs like shelter and food have become significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The average cost to buy a house in Canada was $413,000 in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. By May 2024, this average had soared to $699,000, a staggering 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Beyond housing and food, costs for transportation, entertainment, and general expenses have also increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Income Growth Has Not Kept Pace
Unfortunately, income growth has not kept pace with the rising cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. According to Stat Canada, the median after-tax income of Canadian families and unattached individuals in 2022 was $70,500, a decrease from $73,000 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Average wages likely haven't increased enough in 2023 or 2024 to match inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs have further strained finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Impact on Canadians
The financial struggles contribute to widespread unhappiness in Canada, particularly among youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While Canada ranks 15th happiest country overall in the latest World Happiness Report by the Gallup World Poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, Canadians under 30 fall to almost the very bottom at 58th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Many Canadians are considering moving provinces; 28% of all Canadians, almost a third, are contemplating interprovincial migration due to high housing costs, with young adults and renters being most likely to consider it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This trend is notable in Ontario and BC, where housing costs have been persistently high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Alberta is a popular relocation spot, with 18% of Canadians considering a move there due to more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Between 2022 and 2023, net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

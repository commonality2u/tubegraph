The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a significant, tax-free payment designed to help Canadian families with the cost of raising children under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The CCB can potentially cover almost half of this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Key Features of the CCB

The CCB has two primary features:
*   **Indexed to Inflation** It is indexed to inflation, meaning the payment amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free** The CCB is completely tax-free, ensuring every dollar received is yours to keep without deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

There are no restrictions on how the CCB money can be spent; families can use it for food, housing, education, or other necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Significant Financial Support

For a single child, families can receive up to $125,500 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. There is no limit to the number of children for whom one can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **One Child:** Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Two Children:** Doubles to $251,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Three Children:** Up to $376,000 <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

For families with lower incomes, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Maximum Annual Payments (Current Figures)
*   **Children Under Six:** Up to $7,778 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Children Age 6 to 17:** Up to $6,570 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, totaling $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_ccb_benefits | Eligibility and Calculation of CCB Benefits]]

The CCB is based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, this is the combined income of both spouses, minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

As your AFNI increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced payments or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Reduction Stages
The benefit reduction occurs in two stages:
1.  **Stage 1:** If your income is between $36,525 and $79,000, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
2.  **Stage 2:** If your income is above approximately $79,000 (after the initial $3,000 reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over the $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

For exact calculations, especially with multiple children, it is recommended to use the CRA's CCB calculator or contact the CRA directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Getting Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward:
*   **Automatic Calculation:** The CRA automatically calculates your payments once you file your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. No extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **File Taxes Annually:** Ensure you and your partner file your taxes every year and that your child is registered with the government to continue receiving payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the climate action incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Direct Deposit:** Set up direct deposit with the CRA for faster payments directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Payment Dates:** CCB payments are typically issued between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Keep Information Up-to-Date
It is crucial to update the CRA immediately if your family's income changes (e.g., due to job loss), or if there are life events such as marriage, birth of a new baby, or divorce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. These changes could qualify you for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Similarly, inform the CRA about changes in shared custody arrangements, as they typically split payments 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of the CCB

The CCB is a key tool in [[impact_of_ccb_on_child_poverty_and_birth_rates | reducing child poverty]] and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone, supporting 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Additionally, it aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging family growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

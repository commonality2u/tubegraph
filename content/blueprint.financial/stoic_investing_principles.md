Stoicism, an ancient philosophy that emphasizes controlling what is within one's power and ignoring what is not, offers a powerful mindset for [[Investment strategies for beginners | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Many investors are swayed by emotions, becoming excited when stocks rise and panicking when they fall, leading to impulsive reactions based on headlines and market updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. In contrast, "RSP millionaires" adopt a stoic approach, adhering to a rules-based system consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Principles of Stoic Investing

Stoic investors demonstrate distinct behaviors that contribute to their long-term success:

### Ignoring Market Noise
The media constantly bombards investors with financial hype and doom, reporting on market crashes, soaring stocks, or impending recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Stoic investors do not react to this noise, understanding that short-term market movements are irrelevant to their long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Instead of impulsive decisions, they remain focused on their established plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Controlling Emotions
Stoic investors do not allow fear or greed to dictate their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. While average investors might chase "hot stocks" and make risky bets when the market is high, or panic sell during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, stoic investors do the opposite. They avoid getting caught up in hype and do not panic when market conditions worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. They trust their strategy, recognizing that adherence to a plan outperforms emotionally driven decisions over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Accepting Volatility
Market fluctuations are an inherent part of [[Investment strategies for beginners | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Many individuals become alarmed when their portfolios drop, mistakenly viewing temporary losses as permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Stoic investors, however, view downturns as buying opportunities, continuing to invest with the knowledge that markets tend to recover and grow over decades, not mere hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## The Impact of Stoic Investing

Consider two investors:
*   **Josh, the Emotional Investor:** Constantly checks his portfolio, panics and sells during market drops, and rushes to buy into "hot stocks" during rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This emotional decision-making often results in buying high and selling low, negatively impacting his returns and incurring additional trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Ashley, the Stoic Investor:** Invests consistently without being influenced by daily market news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. She remains committed to her RSP contributions regardless of short-term market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. After 30 years, Ashley achieves greater wealth, not through superior stock picks, but by maintaining calmness and sticking to her plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

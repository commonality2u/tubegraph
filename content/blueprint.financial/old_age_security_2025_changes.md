The year 2025 brings several updates for [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits, impacting [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement income and financial security]] for seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Payment Dates in 2025

The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for [[canada_pension_plan_2025_updates | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]], [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], and [[guaranteed_income_supplement_2025_updates | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means recipients will receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These [[2025_pension_payment_schedules | payment dates]] are typically in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received slightly earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!INFO] Pro Tip: For added convenience, set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account. This ensures timely receipt of funds and is a more reliable option than waiting for a mail check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Cost of Living Adjustment

[[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments are reviewed quarterly, not annually, to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For the January to March 2025 period, there will not be an increase, as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a small dip over the preceding months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, over the past year, [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] benefits have still grown by 2%, helping seniors maintain purchasing power against rising living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## OAS Clawback Threshold Update

The [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] pension recovery tax, commonly known as the "clawback," requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] benefits if their net income exceeds a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

For the period from July 2024 to June 2025, this threshold is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Seniors with net income surpassing this amount are required to repay 15% of the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

> For example, if a senior's net income is $100,000, the repayment would be 15% of the difference between $100,000 and $90,997, which equals approximately $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

To minimize the impact of the clawback, strategies such as income splitting or using a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can help keep net income below the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Increased OAS Pension at Age 75

Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This measure was introduced in July 2022 to address the financial challenges faced by older seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

For the January to March 2025 quarter:
*   For individuals aged 65 to 74, the maximum monthly [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payment is $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   For individuals aged 75 or older, the maximum monthly payment increases to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

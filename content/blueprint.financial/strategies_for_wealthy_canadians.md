While Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) are beneficial, they may not be sufficient for building significant wealth in Canada. Wealthy Canadians utilize additional tools and [[strategies for increasing income and net worth in Canada | strategies]] to grow and protect their money beyond traditional RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Three powerful approaches include Private Equity, Individual Pension Plans (IPPs), and Family Trusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Private Equity

Private Equity is a high-stakes [[investment strategies for beginners in Canada | investment game]] involving investments in privately held companies not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. These investments typically fund startups, finance turnarounds, or support business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Unlike traditional stocks, private equity carries higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity, but offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit capital for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Private Equity and RSPs

RSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments and do not typically allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Therefore, most private equity investments need to be held outside an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

However, certain self-directed RSPs can provide access to private equity under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts allow investors to hold CRA-approved private equity funds, enabling tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Examples include the North Leaf Capital Partners private equity fund and select private equity investments available through Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Downsides of Private Equity

Like any high-reward investment, private equity comes with notable drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:

*   **High Fees**: Private equity investments include significant costs such as management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **High Risk**: These investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell, and there's always a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For instance, many Canadian investors suffered losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Long Lockup Periods**: Investors must commit funds for extended periods, typically 5 to 10 years, before seeing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For example, a $100,000 investment might be locked for 5 years before a payout, with no access to funds during that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Despite these downsides, private equity can be a powerful wealth-building tool for patient and strategic investors, supplementing an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Individual Pension Plans (IPPs)

An Individual Pension Plan (IPP) is a pension plan tailored specifically for business owners or incorporated professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Unlike an RSP, which has a set contribution cap, an IPP allows for higher contributions, especially for those over 40, while offering tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. It functions as a corporate-sponsored pension plan designed to provide structured [[retirement planning strategies in Canada | retirement income]], making it a preferred choice for high-income earners seeking a strategic way to save for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### How an IPP Replaces RSPs

While an RSP is like a "savings account on steroids," an IPP is more akin to a personalized pension planâ€”more structured, powerful, and built for long-term security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Key differences include:

*   **Reduced RSP Contribution**: Once an IPP is set up, the ability to contribute to an RSP is reduced or eliminated as the IPP takes priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Bigger Contributions**: IPPs allow significantly higher contributions than RSPs, particularly as individuals age, leading to greater tax deferral and faster growth of [[financial planning for Canadian retirees | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Reliable Retirement Income**: IPP withdrawals follow a structured pension-like system, providing predictable income, similar to a defined benefit pension plan, unlike RSPs where individuals control withdrawal timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### When an IPP Outperforms an RSP: Real-World Examples

*   **High-Income Business Owner**: Daniel, a 50-year-old business owner earning $250,000 annually, maxed out his RSP. By setting up an IPP, he could contribute over $50,000 annually, significantly increasing tax deductions and boosting [[retirement planning strategies in Canada | retirement savings]] beyond the 2024 RSP cap of $31,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Late Start to Retirement Savings**: Linda, a 55-year-old professional with a corporation who had not saved enough, established an IPP. This allowed her to make past service contributions covering previous working years, rapidly growing her retirement fund while reducing her corporation's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Corporate Tax Efficiency**: Ryan, a 40-something incorporated consultant, transitioned from an RSP to an IPP. IPP contributions are considered a corporate expense, reducing his company's taxable income and leading to lower corporate taxes while securing his retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Success Story**: A doctor client increased his tax deductions by over 50% compared to his RSP and secured a steady pension for retirement after switching to an IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Setting up an IPP can be complex but offers significant tax and [[retirement planning strategies in Canada | retirement benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Family Trust

A Family Trust provides greater flexibility in managing wealth, reducing taxes, and planning for future generations, complementing personal tax-sheltered retirement savings tools like RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### What is a Family Trust?

A Family Trust can potentially allow income to be distributed among family members in lower tax brackets, minimizing overall tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Unlike an RSP, which has strict contribution limits and taxable withdrawals in [[retirement planning strategies in Canada | retirement]], a Family Trust has no contribution caps and offers more control over how and when money is distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It can hold a variety of assets, including private equity, businesses, real estate, and other investments, making it a powerful tool for long-term [[financial planning for Canadian retirees | financial planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Because RSP withdrawals are fully taxable, they aren't always the most efficient way to transfer wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. A Family Trust, however, allows assets to be potentially passed down tax-efficiently and enables [[income splitting strategies for Canadians | income splitting]] amongst family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This makes it an excellent [[strategies for maximizing TFSA growth | strategy]] for business owners and high-income earners looking to reduce taxes while building generational wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Key Benefits of a Family Trust over an RSP

*   **No Contribution Limits**: A Family Trust can hold and grow significant wealth without annual caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Tax-Efficient Income Distribution**: If structured correctly, income can potentially be allocated to lower-tax family members to reduce overall tax exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Wealth Transfer Advantages**: Unlike RSPs, which trigger full taxation upon withdrawals, a Family Trust allows for potentially smoother and more tax-efficient intergenerational wealth transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For example, instead of passing down a million-dollar RSP and paying 50% in taxes, a trust can be structured to legally minimize taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pro Tip
> Consider using a corporate trustee for a Family Trust if there are concerns about family disputes. This helps keep matters professional and avoids future tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

A Family Trust is not just for the ultra-wealthy; it can be a smart tool for many Canadians looking to manage wealth more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. When paired with an RSP, it can enhance tax efficiency, protect assets, and provide financial security across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

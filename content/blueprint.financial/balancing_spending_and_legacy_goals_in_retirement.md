Retirees often face a [[save_or_spend_dilemma_in_retirement | dilemma]] where, despite having sufficient savings, they hesitate to spend freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This reluctance is common, and a significant factor can be the desire to leave a legacy for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Balancing personal enjoyment in retirement with the goal of providing for future generations requires careful [[financial_planning_for_retirement | financial planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Many clients, particularly those with substantial portfolios, find it challenging to adjust their [[mindset_shift_in_retirement_spending | mindset]] from strict saving habits to spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This often stems from a fear of running out of money prematurely or not meeting their long-term [[defining_retirement_goals_and_lifestyle_planning | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Case Study: Robert and Susan â€“ Balancing Spending and Legacy Goals

[[reallife_examples_of_retirement_budgets | Real-life examples of retirement budgets]] illustrate how this balance can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Robert and Susan, aged 70 and 68, sought to enjoy their retirement while ensuring a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Client Profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>

*   **Combined Income:** Approximately $100,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Expenses:** $75,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Savings:** $1.2 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Goal:** To leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### The Process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

Despite their healthy income and substantial savings, Robert and Susan were cautious about increasing their spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. They were unsure if they could afford more travel and leisure activities without compromising their [[defining_retirement_goals_and_lifestyle_planning | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

A review of their [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | financial situation]] revealed that their $1.2 million portfolio, using a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide an additional $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, this meant they had more than enough to cover their existing expenses and flexibility to increase spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### The Solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

To strike a balance between their lifestyle and [[defining_retirement_goals_and_lifestyle_planning | legacy goals]], it was recommended that they increase their spending slightly from $75,000 to $85,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This allowed them to allocate more funds towards travel and experiences while maintaining their goal of leaving an inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Their portfolio was stress-tested by factoring in potential market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The analysis showed that even in adverse market conditions, they could comfortably maintain their spending without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This type of stress testing is a key part of providing peace of mind within a [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | financial plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### The Outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>

Armed with a clear spending plan, Robert and Susan gained the confidence to enjoy a higher quality of life in retirement while still leaving a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach helped them achieve the right balance between enjoying their retirement and fulfilling their long-term [[defining_retirement_goals_and_lifestyle_planning | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

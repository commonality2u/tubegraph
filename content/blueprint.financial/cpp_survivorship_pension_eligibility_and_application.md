The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) does not always cease upon death; rather, a [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]] may be available to the deceased's spouse or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Eligible survivors could receive up to $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Eligibility for the CPP Survivorship Pension

To qualify for the [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]], two main requirements must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:

1.  **Relationship Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>: The applicant must have been the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
2.  **CPP Contributions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>: The deceased must have contributed to CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, or they must have contributed for at least 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Application Process and Important Considerations

### Applying for the Pension

Applying for the [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | survivorship pension]] is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The application can be completed on the Government of Canada's website, and supporting documents, such as the spouse's death certificate, will be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Important Application Tip

> [!TIP] Apply as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>! Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond this period could result in lost funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is crucial to remember during the grieving process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
>
> **Example:** If Emma is eligible for $700 a month in [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivor benefits]] after John's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, but she waits 18 months to apply, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Factors Affecting the Amount Received

The amount of [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]] depends on two primary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>:
1.  The survivor's age at the time of the spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  The amount the deceased spouse contributed to the CPP over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of their actual age at passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

There is a cap on the total CPP benefits an individual can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of personal CPP benefits and the [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | survivorship pension]] cannot exceed the maximum CPP retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. For example, in 2024, the maximum retirement cap was $1,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Duration of Payments

The [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]] is received for life, with no time limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Remarrying or New Relationship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>: Entering a new marriage or common-law relationship does not affect eligibility, and payments will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Death of the Survivor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>: Payments will cease upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

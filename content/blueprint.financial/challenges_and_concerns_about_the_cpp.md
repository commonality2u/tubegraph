Public perception regarding the future of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) indicates significant apprehension, with 64% of Canadians believing the fund will not be available when they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This worry is fueled by several factors, including [[aging_populations | aging populations]], [[rising_costs | rising costs]], and discussions about provinces like Alberta potentially withdrawing from the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting
A natural concern arises regarding the accuracy and trustworthiness of CPP reports and audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The historical example of corporate scandals like Enron, which also had audits before its collapse, highlights this legitimate concern about financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. However, the CPP has safeguards in place, including independent assessments by the Chief Actuary of Canada, reviews by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), and external audits by firms like Deloitte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Investment Performance Volatility
While [[future_growth_projections_of_cpp | CPP Investments]] employs an active management strategy designed to outperform passive approaches over the long term, this approach can lead to underperformance in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. For instance, in fiscal year 2024, the CPP's net return of 8% fell significantly short compared to its reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This substantial underperformance in a given year is acknowledged as an inherent aspect of active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

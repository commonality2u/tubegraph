[[Income splitting strategies for couples | Income splitting]] with your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) is a strategy designed to transfer income from a higher-earning spouse to a lower-earning spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:48">[07:44:48]</a>. The primary goal is to reduce the overall tax burden by taxing the income at a lower rate for the lower-earning spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:57">[07:50:57]</a>.

## Why it's Important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:57">[07:50:57]</a>

The benefit of [[income_splitting | income splitting]] lies in reducing the combined taxable income of a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:93">[08:19:93]</a>. By allocating income to the spouse in a lower tax bracket, the household can significantly lower their overall tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:34">[08:45:34]</a>.

## How [[Pension income splitting | Income Splitting]] Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:04">[07:56:04]</a>

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this strategy functions:

1.  **Convert RSP to RRIF**: You must convert your RSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:45">[07:59:45]</a>.
2.  **Age Requirement**: The income from your RRIF becomes eligible for [[income_splitting | income splitting]] once you turn 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:23">[08:00:23]</a>. You must be at least 65 for this strategy to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:37">[08:07:37]</a>.
3.  **Allocate Income**: You can allocate up to 50% of your eligible [[Pension income splitting | pension income]], including RRIF withdrawals, to your spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:04">[08:10:04]</a>.
4.  **Tax Return Declaration**: This allocation is performed on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:87">[08:14:87]</a>. Both spouses must complete Form T1032, "Joint Election to Split Pension Income," and include it with their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:25">[09:01:25]</a>. This ensures correct reporting and tax benefits for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:63">[09:09:63]</a>.

## Example Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:98">[08:22:98]</a>

Consider Jane and Bob, both aged 67 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:69">[08:23:69]</a>:

*   Jane has a RRIF and an annual income of $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:14">[08:27:14]</a>.
*   Bob has no RRIF and earns $20,000 annually from part-time work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:21">[08:31:21]</a>.

By [[income_splitting | splitting]] Jane's RRIF income, she allocates $10,000 to Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:20">[08:36:20]</a>.

*   Jane's taxable income becomes $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:02">[08:40:02]</a>.
*   Bob's taxable income becomes $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:53">[08:43:53]</a>.

This strategy significantly lowers their combined taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:34">[08:45:34]</a>.

## Benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:62">[08:52:62]</a>

The beauty of this strategy is the flexibility it offers:

*   **Controlled Income**: You can adjust withdrawal amounts to control your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:62">[08:52:62]</a>.
*   **Maximized Tax Savings**: This allows for maximizing tax savings each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:80">[08:56:80]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: It mainly involves calculations and paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:23">[08:50:23]</a>. If needed, an accountant can assist with the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:51">[09:16:51]</a>.

## Important Note

It's crucial to look at the overall financial picture for this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:43">[07:33:43]</a>.

[[income_splitting_strategies_for_canadians | Income splitting]] is a complex but highly effective tax management strategy for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While managing individual taxes can be complicated, adding a partner makes it even more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, when executed correctly, [[income_splitting_strategies_for_canadians | income splitting]] can lead to significant tax savings, potentially exceeding six figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It requires careful coordination between partners; a misstep could result in higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The following strategies are presented from the simplest to the most complex:

## Strategy 1: Using Your FHSA

This is a lesser-known [[fhsa_for_income_splitting | income splitting]] strategy, primarily because the FHSA (First Home Savings Account) is a relatively new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

*   **How it Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
    *   This strategy is suitable for couples where one partner has unused FHSA contribution room, and the other has maxed out their other tax-advantaged accounts like an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   The FHSA offers tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   The partner with maxed-out accounts can gift money to their partner who has unused FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   This prevents the gifted money from being invested in a taxable non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   The receiving partner gains a tax deduction and benefits from tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Example (Ted and Robin)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>:
        *   Ted, who has maxed out his registered accounts, gifts $8,000 to Robin, who has not yet contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
        *   Without the FHSA, Ted would invest $8,000 in a taxable account, paying $132 annually in taxes on $400 of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
        *   With the FHSA, Robin contributes $8,000, gains an immediate $2,400 tax deduction, and avoids taxes on the $400 investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
        *   This results in a combined total savings of $2,532, plus all future investment growth is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
        *   If not used for a home, the FHSA can be rolled over into an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Pros** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:
    *   **Double Benefit:** One partner avoids taxable investment growth, while the other gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** Withdrawals are tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   **Flexibility:** If not used for a home, the FHSA can be rolled into an RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

*   **Cons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>:
    *   **Eligibility:** The receiving partner must not have owned a home in the past four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Ownership Risk:** Gifted funds legally belong to the receiving partner, making it difficult for the gifting partner to reclaim them if the relationship ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Strategy 2: Splitting Employer-Sponsored Pension Income

[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

*   **Eligibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>:
    *   Eligibility depends on the type of pension income and whether the individuals are under or over the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   This section applies to employer-sponsored pension income, not CPP, which is covered in a later strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

*   **Rules for Defined Benefit (DBPP) and Defined Contribution (DCPP) Pension Plans** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
    *   **Before Age 65:**
        *   Income from a DBPP qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
        *   Withdrawals from a DCPP generally do not qualify, unless in special circumstances like the spouse's passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   **After Age 65:** Both DBPP and DCPP income are eligible for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Withdrawals from RRIFs (Registered Retirement Income Funds) and LIFs (Life Income Funds) also become eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted and Robin)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>:
    *   Ted receives $40,000 annually from his pension, taxed at his 30% marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   Robin has minimal income and is in a 15% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   By using [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]], Ted shifts some pension income to Robin, resulting in lower overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   **Effectiveness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>:
        *   Without splitting, Ted pays $12,000 in taxes (30% of $40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
        *   By splitting 20% of the income with Robin, she is taxed at her lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
        *   This results in a combined tax saving of $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Strategy 3: Spousal RRSP Contributions

[[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | Spousal RRSP contributions]] are a simple yet effective way to share the tax burden in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **How it Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:
    *   The higher-income spouse contributes to an RRSP in the lower-income spouse's name, receiving an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   When the lower-income spouse withdraws funds in retirement, they are taxed at their lower marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   This strategy helps balance retirement incomes, especially if one spouse has a workplace pension or there's a significant age gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted and Robin)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>:
    *   Ted earns $120,000 annually (taxed at 35%), and Robin earns $40,000 annually (taxed at 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Their goal is to equalize retirement savings, particularly as Ted has a work pension and Robin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Ted contributes $12,000 to a spousal RRSP in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   **Immediate Deduction:** Ted's contribution lowers his taxable income, saving him $4,200 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Future Tax Efficiency:** When Robin withdraws the funds, she pays $2,400 in taxes at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   This results in a net savings of $1,800 in household taxes by shifting income to Robin's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   The strategy aims to predict who will have the lower income in retirement and capitalize on that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

*   **Pro Tips** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>:
    *   **Avoid Early Withdrawals:** If the lower-income spouse withdraws funds within three years of the contribution, the amount is attributed back to the higher-income spouse and taxed at their higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
    *   **Plan for Equal Balances:** Aim for equal RRSP balances to avoid uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   **Consider Age Differences:** If one spouse is significantly younger, plan contributions to ensure balanced withdrawals during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Strategy 4: Splitting CPP Income

For couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, [[cpp_income_splitting | income splitting]] is a straightforward way to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

*   **How it Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>:
    *   Up to 50% of CPP benefits can be shifted from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   This reduces the household tax bill and can even help avoid the OAS (Old Age Security) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted and Robin)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>:
    *   Ted receives $12,000 annually in CPP benefits (taxed at 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   Robin receives $6,000 in CPP benefits (taxed at 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   By splitting Ted's CPP income, they shift $3,000 to Robin, resulting in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   **Results** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>:
        *   Without splitting, Ted pays more taxes due to his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
        *   With splitting, shifting $3,000 of CPP income to Robin lowers their overall tax bill by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Strategy 5: Splitting Capital Losses

Capital losses can be transferred to a spouse to offset their capital gains using the Superficial Loss Rule, which reduces the household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

*   **How it Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>:
    1.  Sell shares at a loss in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    2.  The spouse buys the same shares within 30 days (before or after the sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    3.  The loss is denied to the original seller but is added to the spouse's Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    4.  The spouse must hold the shares for at least 30 days after the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted and Robin)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>:
    *   Ted has a $4,000 capital loss from selling investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   Robin has $15,000 in capital gains from selling her investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   By transferring Ted's loss using superficial loss rules, Robin's taxable gains are reduced, saving both of them taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   **Exact Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>:
        *   Ted sells shares, incurring a $4,000 capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
        *   Robin purchases the same shares within 30 days, triggering the Superficial Loss Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
        *   Ted's loss is denied but added to Robin's cost base for the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
        *   When Robin eventually sells those shares, the $4,000 loss effectively offsets her taxable gains, reducing their overall household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip:** This strategy only works for non-registered accounts. It's crucial to maintain accurate records and know your Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Strategy 6: Investment Loans for Your Spouse or Child (Prescribed Rate Loans)

A [[income_splitting_with_prescribed_rate_loans | prescribed rate loan]] can be a smart way to reduce a family's overall tax bills, but it carries challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

*   **How it Works** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>:
    *   A high-income spouse or family member lends money to a lower-income spouse or child at the CRA's prescribed interest rate (e.g., 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   The borrower invests the money, and any investment income is taxed at their lower rate instead of the lender's higher one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
    *   This strategy can be worthwhile for families with significant income differences and solid investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

*   **Risks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>:
    *   Potential for poor investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   Possibility of increased prescribed rates in the future, which would reduce the strategy's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   Professional guidance is highly recommended before attempting this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Strategy 7: Family Trusts

A Family Trust in Canada is a legal arrangement where a trustee holds assets for beneficiaries, typically family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It offers several tax-saving opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

*   **Benefits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>:
    *   **[[strategies_for_family_tax_savings_and_income_splitting | Income Splitting]] Potential:** Income can be distributed to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets, potentially reducing the overall family tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    *   **Multiply Capital Gains Exemptions:** Allocating capital gains to multiple beneficiaries allows each to utilize their lifetime capital gains exemption, leading to significant tax savings when selling qualified small business shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   **Estate Freezing:** Transferring future asset growth to beneficiaries can minimize taxes upon death by capping the value subject to capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

*   **Considerations:** Family trusts are very complicated and typically require hiring lawyers and accountants for proper setup and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Combining Strategies

The true power of [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_couples | income splitting]] lies in combining multiple strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Think of it as using a well-stocked toolbox to build a solid financial foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

*   **Example of Combined Strategies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>:
    *   A couple could start by contributing to an FHSA for one partner to claim a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   Then, use [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | pension splitting]] in retirement to balance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    *   Add [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | spousal RRSP contributions]] to create even more tax-deferred savings, further reducing household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

These combined strategies can work seamlessly to lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals like saving for a home or planning for a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

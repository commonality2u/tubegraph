[[Income splitting strategies for Canadian taxpayers | Income splitting]] is a complex topic, but it can lead to significant tax savings, potentially over six figures for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's often compared to a carefully choreographed dance between partners; if one partner misses a step, it could lead to higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Starting with simpler strategies and progressing to more advanced ones is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Strategy 1: [[Using FHSA for income splitting | Using Your FHSA]]

This is a lesser-known [[income_splitting_strategies_for_canadian_taxpayers | income splitting]] strategy, likely due to the FHSA (First Home Savings Account) being new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It's designed for couples where one partner has unused FHSA contribution room and the other has maxed out other tax-advantaged accounts like an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

**How it Works**
The FHSA offers tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If one partner has maxed out their tax-advantaged accounts, they can gift money to their partner who hasn't used their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This prevents the money from being invested in a taxable, non-registered account and allows the receiving partner to gain a tax deduction and benefit from tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Ted, who has maxed out his registered accounts, gifts $8,000 to Robin, who hasn't contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Without FHSA**: Ted would invest $8,000 in a taxable account, paying $132 annually on $400 growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **With FHSA**: Robin contributes $8,000 to her FHSA, gains an immediate $2,400 tax deduction, and avoids taxes on $400 in investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Total Savings**: $2,532, plus future growth is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The funds can also be rolled into an RRSP if not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

**Pros**
*   **Double Benefit**: The gifting partner avoids taxable investment growth, and the receiving partner gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Withdrawals are tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Flexible**: If not used for a home, the FHSA can be rolled over into an RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

**Cons**
*   **Eligibility**: The receiving partner must not have owned a home in the past four years to qualify for an FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Ownership Risk**: Gifted funds legally belong to the recipient, making them difficult to reclaim if the partnership ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Strategy 2: [[Pension income splitting strategies | Splitting Employer-Sponsored Pension Income]]

[[Pension income splitting as a method to lower taxable income | Pension income splitting]] allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Eligibility depends on the type of pension income and whether the individuals are under or over 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This specifically applies to employer-sponsored pension income, not CPP, which is covered in Strategy 4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

**Eligibility Rules**
There are two main types of employer-sponsored pension income: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (DBPP) and Defined Contribution Pension Plans (DCPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

*   **Before Age 65**:
    *   **DBPP**: Income qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   **DCPP**: Withdrawals generally do not qualify, unless the spouse passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **After Age 65**: Both DBPP and DCPP income are eligible for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Withdrawals from RIFs (Registered Income Funds) and LIFs (Life Income Funds) also become eligible, simplifying the balancing of taxable income for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Ted receives $40,000 annually from his pension, taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Robin has little income, taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Without Splitting**: Ted pays $12,000 in taxes (30% of $40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **With Splitting**: Ted shifts 20% ($8,000) of his pension income to Robin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Robin is taxed at her lower 15% rate on the $8,000, saving $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Ted now pays tax on $32,000 ($9,600).
*   **Total Savings**: Together, they save $3,000 in taxes by shifting income to a lower bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Strategy 3: Spousal RRSP Contributions

This is a simple yet effective way to share the tax burden in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The higher-income spouse contributes to an RRSP in the lower-income spouse's name, receiving an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. When the lower-income spouse withdraws funds in retirement, they are taxed at their lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This is ideal for balancing [[income_splitting_and_spousal_retirement_savings | retirement incomes]], especially if one partner has a workplace pension or there's a significant age gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Ted earns $120,000 annually (35% tax rate), and Robin earns $40,000 annually (20% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The goal is to equalize retirement savings, as Ted has a work pension and Robin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Ted contributes $12,000 to a spousal RRSP in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Immediate Deduction**: Ted's contribution lowers his taxable income, saving him $4,200 in taxes ($12,000 * 35%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Future Tax Efficiency**: When Robin withdraws the $12,000 in retirement, she pays $2,400 in taxes ($12,000 * 20%) at her lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Net Savings**: $1,800 ($4,200 - $2,400) in household taxes by shifting income to Robin's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

[!PRO TIP]
*   **Avoid Early Withdrawals**: If the spousal RRSP funds are withdrawn by the lower-income spouse within three years of the higher-income spouse's contribution, the amount will be attributed back to the higher-income spouse and taxed at their rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Plan for Equal Balances**: Aim for equal RRSP balances to prevent uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Consider Age Differences**: If one spouse is significantly younger, plan contributions to ensure balanced withdrawals during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Strategy 4: Splitting CPP Income

For couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] is a straightforward way to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. You can shift up to 50% of CPP benefits from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This lowers the household tax bill and can help avoid the OAS (Old Age Security) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Ted receives $12,000 annually in CPP benefits (30% tax rate), and Robin receives $6,000 (15% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: By splitting Ted's CPP income, they shift $3,000 to Robin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Without Splitting**: Ted pays more in taxes because his income falls into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **With Splitting**: Shifting $3,000 of CPP income to Robin lowers their overall tax bill by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Strategy 5: Splitting Capital Losses

Capital losses can be transferred to a spouse to offset their capital gains, utilizing the Superficial Loss Rule, which reduces the household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This is one of the [[advanced_strategies_like_income_splitting_and_tax_loss_harvesting | advanced strategies]].

**How it Works**
1.  **Sell Shares at a Loss**: Sell shares in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
2.  **Spouse Buys Shares**: Your spouse buys the same shares within 30 days (before or after your sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
3.  **Loss Denied to You**: Your loss is denied, but it's added to your spouse's Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
4.  **Spouse Holds Shares**: Your spouse must hold the shares for at least 30 days after the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
Ted has a $4,000 capital loss from selling investments, while Robin has $15,000 in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Ted sells shares and incurs a $4,000 capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Robin purchases the same shares within 30 days, triggering the Superficial Loss Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Result**: Ted's loss is denied but added to Robin's cost base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. When Robin eventually sells those shares, the $4,000 loss effectively offsets her taxable gains, reducing their overall household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

[!PRO TIP]
This strategy only works for non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Good record-keeping and knowing your Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Strategy 6: Investment Loans for Your Spouse or Child

A prescribed rate loan can reduce a family's overall tax bills, though it comes with challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

**How it Works**
A high-income spouse or family member lends money to a lower-income spouse or child at the CRA's prescribed interest rate (e.g., 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The borrower invests the money, and any investment income is taxed at their lower rate instead of the lender's higher one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This strategy may be worthwhile for families with significant income differences and solid investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

[!WARNING]
This strategy carries risks, including the potential for poor investment returns and future increases in prescribed rates, which could reduce its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Professional guidance is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Strategy 7: Family Trusts

In Canada, a Family Trust is a legal arrangement where a trustee holds assets for beneficiaries, typically family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It offers several tax-saving strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

*   **Income Splitting Potential**: Allows for the distribution of income to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets, which can reduce the overall family tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Multiply Capital Gains Exemptions**: Allocating capital gains to multiple beneficiaries allows each to use their lifetime capital gains exemption, potentially leading to significant tax savings when selling qualified small business shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Estate Freezing**: Transferring future growth of assets to beneficiaries can minimize taxes upon death by capping the value subject to capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

[!NOTE]
Family trusts are a very complicated procedure, requiring professional assistance from lawyers and accountants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Combining Strategies

The true power of [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] comes from combining strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE]
A couple could:
1.  Contribute to an FHSA for one partner to claim a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
2.  Use [[pension_income_splitting | pension splitting]] in retirement to balance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
3.  Add spousal RRSP contributions to create more tax-deferred savings, further reducing household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

These strategies can work seamlessly to lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals like saving for a home or planning a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Blueprint Financial offers personalized [[income_splitting_and_individual_pension_plans_for_tax_reduction | income splitting]] plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

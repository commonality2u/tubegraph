The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a crucial source of retirement income, but it's important to understand its [[Tax implications for single retirees | tax implications]] to avoid significant financial impact on your retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## CPP as Taxable Income
CPP payments are considered taxable income, not "free money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This can significantly affect your overall tax situation during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Ignoring these [[Tax implications of RRSP withdrawals | tax implications]] can lead to a lower than expected retirement income and reduce the effectiveness of your overall [[Retirement Strategies Integrating CPP | retirement plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Case Study: David's Tax Bracket and OAS Clawback
Consider David, a 67-year-old retiree with $90,000 per year from various income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. He decides to start receiving his CPP benefits early, adding an additional $10,000 to his annual income, totaling $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Because CPP payments are taxable, this extra $10,000 pushes David into a higher tax bracket in his province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Furthermore, David also receives Old Age Security (OAS) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. His total income now exceeds the 2024 threshold of $90,997, leading to an OAS clawback where part of his OAS payments are reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Specifically, he loses 15% of his OAS benefits, which is $15 for every $100 he earns over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Had David planned strategically, he might have delayed taking his CPP until age 70 to avoid the OAS clawback for longer, or adjusted his income sources to minimize tax impact and prevent the OAS clawback entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Strategies to Mitigate Tax Impact

### Pension Sharing for Couples
For couples, pension sharing is a strategy where spouses can split their CPP income, which can significantly help with taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, if one spouse receives $1,200 per month in CPP and the other receives very little, they can potentially share their CPP so that each reports about $600 in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This can result in substantial tax savings and make the overall retirement income more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### [[Timing of CPP Benefits | Delaying CPP]] and Tax Efficiency
[[Timing of CPP Benefits | Delaying CPP]] can indirectly impact tax efficiency by increasing the monthly benefit, which then requires careful planning to fit into your overall income strategy. Delaying CPP until age 70 increases benefits by 42% over the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This higher payment is indexed to [[inflation_considerations_regarding_cpp | inflation]], preserving purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While the focus of [[Timing of CPP Benefits | delaying CPP]] is often on increased guaranteed income, its interaction with other income sources like OAS highlights the importance of comprehensive tax planning.

### Understanding the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB)
The CPP post-retirement benefit (PRB) allows individuals who continue working while receiving CPP to boost their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. If you are under 70 and still working, you and your employer continue contributing to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. If you earn close to the maximum CPP earning limit, these additional contributions can increase your CPP income by up to $44.46 per month starting the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. These amounts, though seemingly small initially, are for life and indexed to [[inflation_considerations_regarding_cpp | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Over several years, these PRB increases can significantly boost retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## CPP Survivor Benefit Implications
The [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | CPP Survivor benefit]] provides ongoing income to a spouse if something happens to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The amount received by the survivor heavily depends on when the deceased started their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. For instance, starting CPP at age 60 reduces monthly benefits by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If benefits at 65 would have been $1,000 per month, starting at 60 drops it to $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If the primary earner passes away, their spouse might receive 60% of that reduced amount (around $384 per month) instead of the $600 they could have received if CPP was delayed until 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Ignoring these factors could mean a spouse ends up with less financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

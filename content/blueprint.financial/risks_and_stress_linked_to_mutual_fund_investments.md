Investing in mutual funds, often perceived as a secure choice, can inadvertently diminish an investor's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This issue is compounded by [[deceptive_marketing_tactics_in_the_mutual_fund_industry | deceptive marketing tactics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, such as convoluted fees, complex reporting, and excessive jargon designed to confuse investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Underperformance Against Benchmarks

A significant risk with mutual funds is their tendency to [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform benchmarks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. While a fund might show positive returns, it could be earning significantly less than the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This means investors are losing out on potential wealth, even if their balance is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For example, earning 10% when the benchmark returns 20% means an effective loss of 10% in missed gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Case Study: Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A

The Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A, despite managing $4 billion in assets, has consistently [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformed its benchmark]] and category peers over multiple time frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   For example, a $10,000 investment in this fund grew to $16,458, while the index grew to $18,814 and its category to $17,079 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   In 2024, it ranked in the bottom 25% of its category (fourth quartile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Its 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year rankings are in the third quartile, indicating consistent [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Over a decade, it trailed the index by 1.41% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This means an investor with $100,000 in this fund could have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Industry-Wide Underperformance
The SPIVA Canada mid-year 2024 report confirms that most actively managed funds in Canada [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform their benchmarks]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This performance gap widens the longer an investor holds an underperforming fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Over a 10-year period, a staggering 93.4% of actively managed Canadian equity funds failed to beat their benchmark, meaning only 6% succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This represents a significant [[negative_impact_of_mutual_funds_on_wealth_growth | negative impact on wealth growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## High Fees Eroding Returns

Banks generate billions from fees, which many mutual fund investors underestimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Even a fund with good performance can see its long-term growth significantly reduced by [[high_fees_associated_with_mutual_funds | excessive fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A seemingly small 2% annual fee can reduce an investment's final value by over 50% over 30 years, potentially costing hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### The Hidden Cost of Fees
Consider an investment of $100,000 earning a 7% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   With no fees, it grows to $761,000 in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   With a 2% annual fee, it only reaches $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
This difference of nearly $330,000 demonstrates how a 2% fee can wipe out 43% of potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Types of Fees that Destroy Wealth
*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER):** For equity funds, an MER over 1.6% is considered high, and for bond funds, over 0.75% is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In contrast, index ETFs typically charge 0.05% to 0.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, making mutual fund fees up to 30 times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Hidden Trailer Fees:** Many mutual funds include commissions, often 1%, paid to advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. These incentivize advisors to sell [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high-fee funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, rather than what is best for the client.
*   **High Trading Fees/Turnover Ratio:** Funds that frequently buy and sell stocks incur high trading costs, which can be passed on to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Red Flags Regarding Fees
*   **Adviser Reluctance:** An adviser who is unclear or evasive about fee explanations likely benefits from those fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **High Redemption Fees:** Some mutual funds penalize investors for switching out of their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Segregated Funds:** Insurance companies sell segregated funds that resemble mutual funds but come with extremely high fees (often 3-4%) and unnecessary insurance features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. These can be identified if held with insurance companies like Sunlife, Manulife, or Canada Life, or if they include terms like "segregated" or "guaranteed benefits," have fees exceeding 3%, or have a maturity period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Mutual Funds that Cause Stress

Investing should provide peace of mind, not stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If market fluctuations cause sleepless nights, constant portfolio checking, or panic about financial futures, a mutual fund might be too risky for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Signs of Excessive Risk
*   **Stress During Market Declines:** If a market dip leads to worry, impulsive selling, or loss of confidence, the portfolio's risk level may not align with tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Emotional Reactions to Market News:** Taking on too much [[risk_management_in_investments | risk]] can lead to panic selling, which locks in losses and prevents recovery benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding of Fund Holdings:** Some mutual funds contain volatile assets or complex strategies that are not transparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Not knowing the risk level can lead to unpleasant surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Misalignment of Investment Timeline and Risk:** Holding [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_a_TFSA | high-risk equity funds]] when money is needed in a few years can lead to large short-term losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Mental Wealth
Even if a risky investment performs well, it may not be worth it if it compromises mental clarity and the ability to stay the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Recalibrating [[risk_management_in_investments | risk exposure]] to reflect financial goals, time horizon, and volatility tolerance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Closet Indexing

"Closet indexing" is a significant concern in the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This occurs when an actively managed mutual fund closely tracks an index while charging the high fees associated with active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Investors pay for expert decision-making but receive expensive, index-like returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Case Study: TD Canadian Equity Fund
The TD Canadian Equity Fund, a $7.4 billion fund marketed as actively managed, is a classic example of a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   Its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX composite index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   It charges a very high MER of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   Over 10 years, the fund returned 6.87% annually, while the index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   Its MER is significantly higher than a low-cost Canadian index ETF like XIC (0.06%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   A low active share and turnover rate (12%) indicate minimal trading, meaning it isn't making many active decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   An investor with $100,000 in this fund over 10 years would have missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Poor Track Record in Canada
Approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds are invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. A Morningstar study also found that many actively managed Canadian mutual funds have low "active share scores," meaning they barely deviate from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Identifying Closet Indexers
*   **Compare Holdings:** If stock allocations look almost identical to a benchmark ETF, the fund offers no added value for higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Returns:** If a fund's performance consistently moves in lockstep with an index but charges higher fees, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Low Turnover Rate:** A turnover rate under 20% suggests minimal trading and active decision-making, despite high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Tracking Error:** If a fund's returns closely match the index year-over-year, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Tax Inefficiencies

Even well-performing mutual funds can silently drain returns due to tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Many investors unknowingly pay more taxes than necessary because their mutual funds trigger avoidable tax consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Hidden Tax Traps
*   **Distributions in Taxable Accounts:** Mutual funds often distribute capital gains, dividends, and interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. If held in a taxable account, investors may owe taxes even without selling anything, potentially even if the fund lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **High Dividend Funds in Taxable Accounts:** Dividend-paying mutual funds can be tax-inefficient outside of a TFSA or RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While Canadian dividends receive a tax credit, US and international dividends are typically taxed at the investor's full marginal rate, leading to unnecessary tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Reducing Investment Taxes
*   **Use Appropriate Accounts:** Keep dividend-heavy or income-generating funds in RRSPs or TFSAs, and use taxable accounts for tax-efficient ETFs or capital growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This aligns with [[understanding_investment_risks_and_returns_in_a_TFSA | understanding investment risks and returns in a TFSA]] and similar registered accounts.
*   **Consider Switching to ETFs:** Many mutual funds frequently distribute capital gains, while broad market ETFs can be more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Rebalance Wisely:** Selling funds can trigger capital gains tax, so strategic rebalancing is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Psychological Traps

Many investors remain in unsuitable investments due to loyalty to their bank or advisor, or a reluctance to switch due to perceived hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. However, financial well-being and family future should always take precedence over loyalty or minor inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

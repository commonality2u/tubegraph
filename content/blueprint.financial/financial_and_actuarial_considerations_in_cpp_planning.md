Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices Canadians can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin CPP at or before age 65, delaying until age 70 often proves optimal, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This decision is a complex puzzle where each piece, including life expectancy, investment returns, and various income streams, must fit together to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payout | maximize benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## CPP Basics: Impact of Start Age

Most Canadians claim CPP at age 60, with over 70% starting benefits at either 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, options exist for starting at any age between 60 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting at Age 60**: Choosing to start CPP at 60 reduces monthly payments by 0.6% for each month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction from the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70**: Waiting until 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly benefit at age 65 would become $640 at age 60, but jump to $1,420 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Actuarial Study Insights on CPP Start Ages

A detailed 2020 actuarial study provides insights into optimal CPP take-up decisions, considering probabilities, life expectancies, and expected investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 60

This option is generally best for those who need immediate income or have health concerns leading to shorter [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Drawbacks**: It comes with a permanent 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **High Returns**: If personal [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment funds]] can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking CPP at 60 allows for investing the payments, potentially leading to a higher overall financial outcome, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations**: Starting at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on benefits like Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 65

This is the default option, offering a balance with steady payments without requiring savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's suitable for retirees with below-average to average [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] and moderate estimated [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

*   **Predictable Income**: Provides standard, inflation-adjusted CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Tradeoffs**: May leave potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis**: Payments equalize with the 70 option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those uncertain about longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to 70

Delaying provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, with payments increasing by the maximum amount and being inflation-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for individuals with longer [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

*   **Longevity Protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to approximately 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age**: For most, delaying CPP becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Estimating Life Expectancy

Your [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] is a crucial factor in determining when to start CPP, alongside predicted [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Longevity Data

*   **Gender Differences**: Women tend to live longer than men; 82% of women are likely to live past age 80, compared to 79% for men with healthy lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This makes delaying CPP especially beneficial for women seeking secure, inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Age and Life Expectancy**: Statistically, the older you are, the longer your remaining [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For instance, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Common Misconceptions**: Average [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] in Canada is often higher than commonly perceived (around 80-82 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Longevity Insurance**: Delaying CPP acts as a safety net, particularly for women who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Estimating Tools

Several online tools can help estimate [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] based on age, gender, lifestyle, family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>:

*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, it asks detailed questions about health and habits for personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Advanced Methods**: For a more refined estimate, consider genetic testing, lifestyle evaluations, biological age testing, and comprehensive health screenings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## CPP Present Value Calculator

While CPP break-even tables are a good starting point, they don't account for the [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment rate of return]] or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. A CPP present value calculator, such as the one available on TaxTips, provides a more accurate estimate by incorporating these additional [[factors_affecting_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

The calculator allows users to input:
*   Estimated monthly benefit at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Estimated annual indexation (inflation rate) for CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Desired CPP start ages (e.g., 60, 65, 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   Estimated [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Estimated rate of return on investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The tool then calculates the present value of receiving CPP at different ages, highlighting the optimal choice. For example, for a woman in her 50s with a life expectancy of 86 and a conservative 2% return, delaying to age 70 often shows the highest present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. However, increasing the rate of return (e.g., to 4% or 6%) can significantly close the gap between starting ages, making earlier options more competitive depending on individual investment capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Shortened [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] (e.g., passing away at 72) drastically shifts the optimal choice to starting earlier, like age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Holistic CPP Planning

Deciding when to start CPP is not simple; it requires integrating various financial and actuarial considerations into a comprehensive plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Key additional considerations for [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | CPP planning]] include:

*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points**: Analyzing how long one is likely to live and when delaying CPP starts to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies**: Understanding how CPP income interacts with overall [[tax_implications_of_cpp | tax implications]] and potential tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining if delaying CPP can help avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks, or if an earlier start is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating CPP with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Often, delaying CPP into the late 60s or 70s is beneficial for clients, though exceptions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. By considering these factors, individuals can unlock the full potential of their CPP and ensure a secure financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Reaching $10,000 in your TFSA is a significant milestone for many Canadians, with the average person achieving this between ages 25 and 29 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The goal is to grow this to $100,000, a target that is achievable for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

The journey to a $100,000 TFSA can be imagined as baking a cake, requiring five key elements to turn $10,000 of ingredients into a $100,000 TFSA cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
1.  Selecting the right ingredients (Investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
2.  Allowing sufficient time for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
3.  Generating the right 'heat' (Rate of Return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
4.  Adding layers (Regular Contributions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
5.  Avoiding common mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>

## Step 1: The Ingredients – Picking the Right Investments

The investments chosen are the foundation of your TFSA's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. It's crucial to select high-quality investments that align with your risk tolerance and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Common options in Canada include:

*   **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)**: These act as a one-stop shop, investing in hundreds or thousands of companies with a single purchase, thereby spreading risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. They are affordable and generally cheaper than mutual funds, preventing significant loss of returns to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Examples include Vanguard's VFV (tracking the S&P 500) or their portfolio series like XEQT and VGRO (global stocks in one fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Dividend Stocks**: These are a solid option for investors who appreciate regular payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Reinvesting these dividends can compound returns over time, adding stability and income while still growing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Robo-advisors**: These services create and manage a personalized portfolio, handling all adjustments, making them suitable for new investors or those seeking a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Wealthsimple and Questwealth are two great options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Step 2: The Time – Letting It Grow

Time in the market is a powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, time alone is often not enough. For instance, an initial $10,000 investment at a 4% annual return with no additional contributions would take 59 years to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This means starting at age 30 would result in reaching the goal at 89 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, highlighting the need for accelerated action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Step 3: The Heat – Your Investment Rate of Returns

The rate of return directly impacts how long it takes to grow your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **4% Return**: Takes 59 years to turn $10,000 into $100,000, typical of a balanced ETF portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **7% Return**: Reduces the timeline to 34 years, shaving off 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This is achievable with a portfolio more heavily weighted towards equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **10% Return**: Cuts the timeline to 24 years, 35 years faster than a 4% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, this comes with significantly higher volatility and risk, and sustaining a 10% return over 24 years is unlikely for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Finding your comfort zone is key; your rate of return reflects your risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. For stability, a balanced ETF portfolio offers moderate returns with lower risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. If you can handle more volatility, consider allocating to more equities and higher-growth options like tech or international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Step 4: Adding Layers – The Importance of Regular Contributions

Regular contributions are vital for TFSA growth, acting like layers to a cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Each contribution increases portfolio size and strengthens its compounding ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Consistent contributions can significantly reduce the time needed to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:

*   **$1,000 annually**: Shaves 11 years off the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **$3,000+ annually**: Accelerates progress significantly, saving 19 years compared to no contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **$10,000 annually**: Can help reach $100,000 in just 7 years, 27 years faster than relying solely on compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### How to Contribute Consistently
*   **Automate your savings**: Set up automatic monthly or yearly transfers to your TFSA from your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Use windfalls wisely**: Allocate bonuses, tax refunds, inheritances, or extra income to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Increase contributions over time**: As your income grows or financial circumstances improve (e.g., saving with a partner), raise your contributions to maintain momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Step 5: Avoid Common Mistakes

Even with a solid plan, certain missteps can hinder progress toward your TFSA goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Taking on Too Much Risk
Chasing speculative investments like meme stocks or cryptocurrencies for extreme growth can lead to significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. While doubling money in three years is theoretically possible with 100% annual returns, these strategies are highly volatile with a much higher chance of losing money than achieving sustained high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Recovering from significant losses can take years and derail TFSA growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Playing It Too Safe
Conversely, sticking to low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or cash, believing it's the safest route, severely limits growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. For example, at a 2% return, $10,000 would take a staggering 116 years to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Low returns often barely outpace inflation, diminishing purchasing power over time, and investors miss out on the compounding potential of higher-growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Trying to Time the Market
Attempting to buy low and sell high by predicting market movements is incredibly difficult to execute consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Most people miss the best-performing market days by waiting on the sidelines, and even professionals struggle with accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The cost of being wrong can outweigh potential benefits; staying invested through market fluctuations typically outperforms attempts to time the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Ignoring Fees
High fees, common with mutual funds, can significantly erode returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A 2% management fee on a $100,000 portfolio can cost tens of thousands of dollars over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Low-cost options like ETFs offer similar market exposure with substantially lower fees, allowing more of your money to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Not Understanding Your Investments and Risk Tolerance
Before investing, understand how an investment works and if it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Overestimating one's ability to handle risk often leads to poor decisions during market volatility, so it's essential to be honest with yourself and build a portfolio that suits your comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

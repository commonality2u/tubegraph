Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) are a well-known financial tool in Canada, designed to help individuals save for retirement with significant tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While they are considered beneficial for wealth accumulation, they also have limitations, especially for high-net-worth individuals or specific investment strategies.

## Advantages of RRSPs

*   **Tax-Deferred Growth**
    RRSPs allow investments to grow without being taxed until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This means contributions are tax-deductible, reducing taxable income in the year they are made, and any investment income earned within the plan is not taxed until it is withdrawn, typically in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Retirement Savings Tool**
    An RRSP is described as being "like a savings account on steroids," highlighting its effectiveness in accelerating retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. It serves as a personal tax-sheltered retirement savings tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Flexibility with Investment Types (within CRA limits)**
    While primarily designed for publicly traded investments, certain self-directed RRSPs can provide access to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) approved private equity funds under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Examples include the Northleaf Capital Partners Private Equity Fund and select private equity investments available through Wellsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Disadvantages and Limitations of RRSPs

*   **Contribution Caps**
    RRSPs have a set contribution cap, which can limit how much money high-income earners can put away, especially when compared to an [[individual_pension_plans | Individual Pension Plan (IPP)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For example, as of 2024, the RRSP cap was $31,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Limited Investment Scope**
    RRSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments and typically do not allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The CRA restricts RRSP investments to public securities or specific CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means many [[private_equity_investments | private equity]] investments must be held outside an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, and while some are available, a lot are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Not Always Sufficient for "Real Wealth"**
    While "great" for saving, RRSPs "might not be enough" when building substantial wealth in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For individuals looking to maximize retirement savings, especially high earners, an [[individual_pension_plans | IPP]] might be a more suitable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Impact of Individual Pension Plans (IPPs)**
    Once an [[individual_pension_plans | IPP]] is established, an individual's ability to contribute to an RRSP is either reduced or eliminated because the [[individual_pension_plans | IPP]] takes priority in pension contributions, making RRSPs less relevant for those using this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Taxation on Withdrawal and Estate Transfer**
    RRSP withdrawals are fully taxable as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This makes them less efficient for wealth transfer compared to tools like a [[family_trusts | Family Trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. For example, passing down a million-dollar RRSP could result in approximately 50% in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Control**
    Unlike an RRSP, where individuals control how and when they withdraw funds, an [[individual_pension_plans | IPP]] provides a structured, pension-like system for withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Retirement decisions are influenced by a complex interplay of economic, social, and personal factors. While the traditional retirement age of 65 was once suitable for a shorter lifespan and lower costs, contemporary challenges mean more Canadians are working past this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Context

In the late 1990s, Canadians were retiring earlier, with the average retirement age dipping to 60.9 years in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, this trend began to shift:
*   By 2010, the average age rose to 62.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   By 2020, it reached 64.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   In 2024, the average retirement age climbed to 65.3, the highest in nearly half a century, representing a four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Reasons for Working Longer

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This includes individuals from various employment sectors:
*   **Public sector employees** tend to retire around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Private sector workers** typically hold out until about 65 and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Self-employed Canadians** push it even further, retiring on average at nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The decision to work longer is driven by several key factors:

### Financial Necessity vs. Choice
Of the Canadians aged 65-74 still employed in 2022:
*   Approximately 12% worked by choice to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This illustrates [[reasons_why_retirees_continue_working | reasons why retirees continue working]] beyond financial need.
*   Another 9% worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Increased Life Expectancy
Canadians are living longer, which significantly impacts [[impact_of_longer_life_expectancy_on_retirement_planning | retirement planning]]. Life expectancy increases with age, meaning someone who reaches 65 has likely outlived many earlier life risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   At age 40, Canadian men can expect to live to 78, women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   At age 60, men are projected to live to 80.5, women to 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   At age 70, men reach about an 83.2 life expectancy, women 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
If healthy at 65, individuals can expect two or more decades in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, turning retirement into a 20- to 30-year lifestyle rather than a 10-year plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This means more years to fund and manage.

### Changes in Pension Coverage
Defined benefit pensions, which offered predictable lifetime income, are becoming less common, especially in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Many now have defined contribution plans, where retirement income depends on investment performance, shifting more risk and responsibility to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, making retirement [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial planning]] more "DIY" for most.

### Rising Cost of Living
Retirees face surging costs without matching income boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   **Shelter costs:** Up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Groceries:** Food prices increased over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** While public healthcare exists, out-of-pocket costs for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
These increased costs, combined with fixed incomes (e.g., from CPP, OAS, savings), make it harder to make ends meet, especially when still renting, carrying debt, or supporting family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Less Physical Work
Modern jobs are less physically demanding, shifting from manual labor (e.g., construction, manufacturing) to knowledge-based or service roles often involving desks and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. If a job is not physically taxing and an individual remains mentally sharp, there is less incentive to stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Changing Views on Retirement
There is a generational mindset shift, particularly among boomers and Gen Xers, who view retirement less as an escape and more as freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This freedom can mean:
*   Consulting part-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Freelance gigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
For many, retirement is a gradual "ramp" rather than a "cliff," allowing for a slower transition into more flexible and personally fulfilling work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" (divorce among those over 50) is rising and significantly reshaping retirement timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Late-life separations often necessitate a major financial reset, involving:
*   Selling and splitting assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   Legal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   Supporting two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
Existing retirement plans for couples may be insufficient for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This often leads to delaying retirement, downsizing, or re-entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_single_retirees | financial planning for single retirees]].

## Uncertainty as a Factor

Even with sufficient savings, uncertainty can cause hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Factors contributing to this include:
*   Market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Unpredictable housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   Higher-than-expected inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   Rising healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   Geopolitical tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
Many Canadians delay retirement not out of necessity, but to build a larger financial buffer for peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Relying solely on fixed income sources like CPP, OAS, and personal savings can feel risky, as a single market dip, medical emergency, or rent hike could derail a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## The Importance of Strategic Financial Planning

While delaying retirement to build a buffer offers comfort, time in retirement is a valuable asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. A strategic approach to [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial planning]] can make a significant difference.

### Case Study: Keanu's Retirement Scenario
A [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | case study]] using financial planning software for a single 65-year-old retiree, Keanu, highlights how small changes can greatly impact outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Keanu aims for a modest lifestyle of $50,000 per year, with $90,000 annual income before retirement, $400,000 in an RRSP, $100,000 in a TFSA, and a paid-off home, but no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1: Retiring at 65, immediate CPP/OAS**
    *   Keanu runs out of money by age 83, as his RRSP depletes quickly and TFSA cannot cover the remaining expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

*   **Scenario 2: Working three more years (to age 68), immediate CPP/OAS**
    *   Keanu's money easily lasts through age 90, finishing with an estate over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Just three additional years of work provide over a decade of financial breathing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

*   **Scenario 3: Working two more years (to age 67), delaying CPP to 70**
    *   Despite delaying CPP for a higher benefit, Keanu experiences a shortfall. Aggressive RRSP withdrawals between ages 67-69 to cover the gap cause it to drain too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This shows that delaying CPP alone isn't enough without a smart withdrawal strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

*   **Scenario 4: Working two more years (to age 67), delaying CPP to 70, strategic RRSP withdrawals**
    *   Keanu draws gradually from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69, just enough to cover needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   This combination leads to a steady income throughout retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate remaining over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
This demonstrates the power of the right sequencing of payments and withdrawals for [[the_importance_of_personalized_retirement_planning | personalized retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. By tweaking factors like CPP timing, smart withdrawal strategies, and working a bit longer, a viable retirement plan can be built without doubling savings or working until 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

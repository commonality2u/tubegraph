High fees are a significant "silent wealth killer" that can quietly drain the potential of a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) without the owner realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These fees can substantially decrease TFSA wealth over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Sneaky Nature of High Fees

High fees are considered one of the "sneakiest ways to kill your TFSA potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Financial institutions in Canada sometimes use "little tricks" to make it difficult for investors to see the exact amount of fees being paid annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Prevalence in Canada
Canada is recognized for having some of the highest mutual fund fees globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The average Management Expense Ratio (MER) for Canadian Equity Funds is 1.76%, according to Morningstar's report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Major banks like TD, RBC, and CIBC frequently offer funds with MERs exceeding 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

A significant issue is that 93.4% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmarks over a 10-year period, largely attributed to [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Closet Indexing
Many [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high-fee]] funds engage in "closet indexing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This practice involves charging [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] for supposed active management, while in reality, the funds largely mimic the index they are trying to outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Case Study: RBC US Equity Fund vs. Vanguard VFV

A comparison between the RBC US Equity Fund and Vanguard's VFV, both using the S&P 500 as a benchmark, illustrates the impact of [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   The RBC fund, with a 1.88% MER, claims active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Vanguard VFV is a low-cost passive ETF with a 0.09% MER that tracks the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

The RBC fund's performance closely mirrored the index fund, a classic sign of closet indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Over a 5-year period:
*   Vanguard VFV yielded a 116% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. An initial $100,000 investment would grow to $216,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   The RBC fund yielded only an 88% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The same $100,000 would grow to $188,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

This difference amounts to $38,000 in just 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Over a 20 to 30-year timeframe, compounded losses due to [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars lost in tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

An RBC fund with a nearly 2% MER and $4 billion in assets collects approximately $80 million annually in fees from Canadian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Thousands of similar [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high-fee]] funds exist in Canada, siphoning billions of dollars from Canadians' TFSAs every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For more detailed information, consider researching why mutual funds in Canada should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Real-Life Example: David vs. Sarah

David and Sarah, both 65 years old, receive different [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payouts due to their unique contribution histories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:

*   **David**: Started his [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] at age 60 and receives an average of $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Sarah**: Started her [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] at age 65 and receives the maximum payout of $1,364 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Key Factors Determining CPP Payouts

The disparity in [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payouts is primarily due to two factors:

### 1. Contributions

Your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] retirement pension benefits are heavily influenced by the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To receive the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | maximum benefit]], you generally need to:
*   Contribute for at least 39 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The more you contribute and the longer your contribution period, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### 2. Average Earnings

Your average earnings over your career also directly affect your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Consistent high annual earnings that meet or exceed the YMPE will maximize your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Gaps in earnings or years with lower income can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Revisiting David and Sarah

*   **Contribution Period**: Sarah contributed to [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period. David had employment gaps and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Earnings History**: Sarah consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career. David had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced his overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Consistent Contributions**: Sarah maximized her [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] contributions by ensuring her earnings met or exceeded the YMPE every year. David's inconsistent contributions due to career changes and lower-paying jobs meant he didn't reach the same level of total contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The higher your earnings and contributions, the higher your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Strategies to Increase Your CPP Payments

Several strategies can help you move from average to [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | maximum CPP payments]]:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP ([[cpp_postretirement_benefit | Postretirement Benefit]])

If you continue working and contributing to [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] up to age 70 while receiving benefits, these additional contributions earn you a [[cpp_postretirement_benefit | post-retirement benefit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. For example, Sarah, at 67, still working part-time, earns additional post-retirement benefits, increasing her monthly [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### 2. Dropping Out Lower Income Years

The [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] has provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings from your benefit calculation, which can lead to a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>:

*   **General Dropout Provision**: You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equates to about 8 years if you've contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Dropout**: If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions**: Periods of disability can also be adjusted to your advantage, boosting your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### 3. Max Out Earnings and Contributions

While not always easy, aiming to have your annual income meet or exceed the YMPE (currently $68,500 for 2024) will result in higher contributions and, therefore, higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Suggestions include:
*   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Alex, for example, started a successful online business, which helped him exceed the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career, as more earnings mean more [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Longevity of Contributions**: Ensure you've worked and contributed to [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Since [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] is based on your best 40 years of earnings, a longer contribution period with high earnings will result in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## How to Estimate Your CPP Benefits

To find out if you're on track for your desired [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payout, you can use these methods:

### 1. Rule of Thumb

[[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts, now designed to replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE, compared to 25% previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. For example, if your average annual earnings were $40,000, [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] could now provide approximately $13,332 annually, up from about $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This method is a ballpark way to gauge your potential benefits due to the complexities of the calculation over many working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### 2. Online Calculators

For a more tailored estimate, consider:
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator**: This comprehensive tool provides a detailed estimate of your future [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payment but can take about 30 minutes to complete and isn't the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ativa Calculator**: A quicker and easier-to-use option, though its accuracy may decrease the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Your Statement of Contributions

This statement provides an estimate of your monthly [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] benefits at ages 60, 65, and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

You can get it:
*   **Online via My Service Canada Account**: Sign in (or register) and navigate to the [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] OAS section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **By Phone**: Call [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Important Distinctions

It's crucial to understand that while [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying your CPP start age]] significantly increases your payout, it doesn't automatically boost you from the average to the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | maximum payout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The factors mentioned earlier (contributions, earnings) are what move you towards the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The decision of [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | when to start CPP]] is a separate strategic consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

A common misconception is that starting [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] at age 60 helps avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, the reduction for starting [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. For most clients, it's generally better to [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delay your CPP]] as long as possible, even if you're not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is a complex topic, but it can lead to significant tax savings for couples, potentially over six figures in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. One lesser-known [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategy]] involves using the First Home Savings Account (FHSA), which is relatively new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While many think the FHSA is exclusively for home savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, it can also be leveraged for [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] purposes.

## How it Works

This strategy is beneficial for couples where one partner has unused FHSA contribution room, and the other has already maxed out their other tax-advantaged accounts like an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The FHSA offers tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If one partner has maximized their other tax-advantaged accounts, they can gift money to their partner who has unused FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This approach prevents the money from being invested in a taxable non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The receiving partner can then gain a tax deduction and benefit from tax-free growth within the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin

Consider Ted and Robin:
*   Ted has maxed out his registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Robin has not yet contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Ted gifts $8,000 to Robin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

**Without the FHSA:**
*   Ted would have invested $8,000 in a taxable account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   He would pay $132 annually in taxes on $400 of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

**With the FHSA:**
*   Robin contributes $8,000 to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   She gains an immediate tax deduction of $2,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   She avoids taxes on the $400 in investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

This results in a combined total savings of $2,532, plus all future growth on the investments is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The funds can also be rolled over into an RRSP if not used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This highlights the [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax benefits of FHSA versus RRSP]] as a flexible savings vehicle.

## Pros of the Strategy

*   **Double Benefit:** The gifting partner (Ted) avoids taxable investment growth, while the receiving partner (Robin) gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** When the FHSA is used by Robin for a home purchase, the withdrawals are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Flexible:** If Robin does not use the FHSA for a home, she can roll it over into her RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This offers benefits similar to [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | retirement savings using FHSA and RRSP]] by effectively [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_taxfree_home_buying | combining FHSA and RRSP for taxfree home buying]] strategies.

## Cons of the Strategy

*   **Eligibility:** Robin must not have owned a home in the past four years to qualify for the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Ownership Risk:** The gifted funds legally belong to Robin. If the partnership ends, Ted may face significant difficulty reclaiming the $8,000 contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This strategy is one of several [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategies]] that can be combined for greater financial benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. For instance, a couple could start with an FHSA contribution for one partner, then later use [[pension_income_splitting_strategies | pension income splitting strategies]] or spousal RRSP contributions to further reduce household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

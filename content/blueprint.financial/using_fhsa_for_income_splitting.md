[[Income Splitting for Tax Savings | Income splitting]] is a complex topic, but it can lead to significant tax savings, with some clients achieving over six figures in reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's like a choreographed dance where both partners must move in harmony; a misstep can lead to higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

One lesser-known [[Income Splitting for Tax Savings | income splitting]] strategy involves the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This strategy is not widely discussed, likely because the FHSA is a relatively new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. While the FHSA is typically associated with saving for a home, it can effectively be used for [[Income Splitting for Tax Savings | income splitting]] with a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>

This strategy is particularly beneficial for couples where:
*   One partner has unused FHSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The other partner has maxed out their other tax-advantaged accounts, such as an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The FHSA offers tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If the higher-income partner has maxed out their own tax-advantaged accounts, they can gift money to their partner who has unused FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This approach offers a dual benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>:
1.  It prevents the gifted money from being invested in a taxable non-registered account by the higher-income partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  The receiving partner gains a tax deduction and benefits from tax-free growth within the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Example: Ted and Robin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

Consider Ted and Robin:
*   Ted has maxed out his registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Robin has not yet contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

Ted gifts $8,000 to Robin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Why it's Effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

*   **Without FHSA**: If Ted had invested the $8,000 in a taxable account, he would pay approximately $132 annually in taxes on $400 of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **With FHSA**: Robin contributes the $8,000 to her FHSA. She immediately gains a $2,400 tax deduction and avoids taxes on the $400 in investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This results in a combined total savings of $2,532, plus all future investment growth remains tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Additionally, if the FHSA is not used for a home, the funds can be rolled over into an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Pros of this Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

*   **Double Benefit**: Ted avoids taxable investment growth, and Robin gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: When Robin uses the FHSA for a home purchase, the withdrawals are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: If Robin doesn't use the FHSA for a home, she can roll it over into her RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Cons of this Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>

*   **Eligibility**: Robin must not have owned a home in the past four years to qualify for the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Ownership Risk**: The gifted funds legally belong to Robin. If the partnership ends, Ted may have a difficult time reclaiming his contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This strategy is part of a broader set of [[Income Splitting for Tax Savings | income splitting strategies to reduce taxes | income splitting strategies]] that, when combined, can build a strong financial foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. For example, a couple could use the FHSA for one partner, then utilize pension splitting in retirement, and add [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | spousal RRSP contributions]] for further tax-deferred savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. These strategies work seamlessly to lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

The [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] is intensifying its audit activities, particularly targeting real estate and cash-based businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. These sectors have historically been under scrutiny due to concerns about unreported income, undeclared capital gains, and tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. With enhanced data tracking capabilities and increased funding for enforcement, the [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] is now scrutinizing these industries more rigorously than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Who is at Risk?

### Real Estate Investors, House Flippers, and Landlords
Real estate investors, house flippers, and landlords are facing increased scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This is particularly true for those who might be misusing the principal residence exemption to avoid capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. If multiple properties have been sold in recent years, the [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] may investigate whether the individual is genuinely a homeowner or merely flipping houses without proper declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Landlords, especially those renting properties through platforms like Airbnb or VRBO, are also at risk if they fail to accurately report rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Cash-Based Businesses
Cash-based businesses, including restaurants, bars, construction companies, and auto repair shops, are prime targets for audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. The [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] recognizes that businesses dealing predominantly in cash carry a higher risk of underreporting sales or inflating expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. If a business's financial records do not align, an audit can be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Current Focus Areas

### Real Estate Transactions
Real estate transactions are receiving extra attention, particularly concerning undeclared capital gains and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The Underused Housing Tax (UHT) is another key focus, with the [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] identifying homeowners with vacant or underused properties who may be unknowingly violating tax rules or have not properly reported what they owe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Cash Transactions
For business owners, the [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] is adopting a more stringent approach to cash transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Businesses whose reported earnings appear suspiciously low compared to industry standards may receive an audit notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The era of cash transactions going unnoticed is rapidly coming to an end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Protection from Increased Audits

To protect yourself from increased [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] audits and crackdowns:
*   **Report Property Sales Correctly** Do not misuse the principal residence exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Declare All Rental Income** This includes earnings from platforms like Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Maintain Pristine Records** Cash-heavy businesses, in particular, should meticulously track every transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Be Cautious with Deductions** Ensure all claims are accurate, as AI systems are flagging excessive deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Do not inflate expenses, as the [[increased_audits_and_ai_usage_by_the_cra | CRA]] cross-checks business filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

In the event of an audit, it is crucial to remain calm and organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. A prompt response with well-maintained records can significantly impact the audit's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

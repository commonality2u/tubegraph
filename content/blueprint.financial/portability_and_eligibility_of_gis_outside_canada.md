The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a Canadian monthly benefit designed to support [[gis_updates_for_lowincome_seniors | low-income seniors]] who reside in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, its portability is often misunderstood by Canadians planning to [[gis_benefits_and_the_implications_of_retiring_abroad | retire abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## GIS Portability Rules

The GIS is explicitly **not portable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Its entitlement is strictly tied to an individual's physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Automatic Disqualification

If you depart Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies regardless of whether your income remains low or you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

> "Your guaranteed income supplement payments can stop if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

### No Social Security Agreements for GIS

Unlike other Canadian benefits like the [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]], there are no [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | social security agreements]] with other countries that protect or allow for the continued receipt of GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. GIS is solely dependent on Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Case Example

Consider Gan, a 71-year-old retiree who was receiving both CPP and GIS in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. After moving to Mexico, her GIS was terminated within a few months because she was outside Canada for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Planning for Retirement Abroad with GIS

If GIS constitutes a significant portion of your retirement income, it is crucial to account for its cessation before relocating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Strategies may include delaying your move, adjusting your budget, or exploring alternative income sources to offset the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### "Snowbird" Strategy

Some retirees choose to maintain part-year residency in Canada to preserve their Canadian healthcare and tax status, including eligibility for GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This involves spending winters in warmer climates but ensuring they do not remain outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Contrast with Other Benefits

The behavior of GIS when moving abroad stands in stark contrast to [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP benefits]] and [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]]. While CPP is based on contributions and generally travels with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, and OAS can continue if specific long-term residency requirements (20+ years) are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, GIS unequivocally stops after six months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. There is "no workaround" for GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

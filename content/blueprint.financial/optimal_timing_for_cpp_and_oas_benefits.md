Deciding when to start your [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | CPP]] (Canada Pension Plan) and [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | OAS]] (Old Age Security) benefits can significantly impact your retirement income and tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Estimating your income and expenses between ages 60 and 69 can help determine the most tax-efficient timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | Impact of Delaying Benefits]]

[[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | Delaying CPP and OAS]] until age 70 significantly increases your monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | CPP]] grows by 8.4% per year after age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | OAS]] grows by 7.2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

This higher income is often worth the wait, especially if you have other sources of income to cover your expenses early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Example: John's Delaying Strategy

John, who plans to work part-time and sell property between ages 65 and 69, chose to [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | delay his CPP and OAS benefits]] until 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If he had started at 65, he would receive $1,500 per month ($18,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Starting early would push him into a higher marginal tax bracket and subject him to the [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | OAS clawback]] (a 15% recovery tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

By delaying, John's [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | CPP]] and [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | OAS]] increased to a combined income of $2,125 per month or $25,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This strategy provides him with an extra $7,500 annually and keeps his tax bill lower during his early retirement years (ages 65-69) by maintaining a lower marginal tax rate and avoiding the [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## When Early Benefits May Be Better

[[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | Delaying benefits]] isn't always the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Consider starting [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | CPP]] or [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | OAS]] sooner if:
*   You have [[impact_of_health_on_cpp_timing_decisions | health concerns]] such as a shorter life expectancy, which may make taking early benefits more practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   You have immediate income needs and other income sources are limited, as starting [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | CPP]] at 60 or 65 provides needed stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

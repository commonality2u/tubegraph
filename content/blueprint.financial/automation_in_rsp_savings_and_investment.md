Building substantial wealth in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) often involves more than just high earnings or stock-picking prowess. A key principle adopted by "RSP millionaires" is the strategic use of automation to ensure consistent and effortless contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This approach helps individuals "trick their future selves into being rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> by removing human error and the need for constant discipline from the saving equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## The Secret to Effortless Saving

RSP millionaires prioritize automated saving by integrating it into their financial routines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Pre-Authorized Contributions
A core strategy is setting up pre-authorized RSP contributions to occur automatically on payday. This ensures money is directed to savings before it can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This method aligns with the principle of paying your RSP first, treating it like an essential bill such as rent or a mortgage payment, making it non-optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Automatic Contribution Increases
To further accelerate savings growth, RSP millionaires often set up automatic annual increases to their contributions, for example, by 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This strategy, also known as the "force scarcity trick," involves immediately bumping up RSP contributions by 2-3% every time a raise is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Since the extra money is allocated before it's "felt," it's never missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Reinvesting RSP Tax Refunds
Instead of spending their RSP tax refunds on vacations or gadgets, RSP millionaires consistently reinvest these refunds into their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Over time, this disciplined approach can add tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars to their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Leveraging "Free Money" and Tax Advantages
Automated wealth-building also involves maximizing available benefits:
*   **Employer RSP Matching:** Always taking full advantage of employer matching programs, as this is essentially free money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Spousal RSPs:** Utilizing spousal RSPs to balance taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Deduction Carry Forwards:** Claiming deduction carry forwards when they will result in the greatest tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Avoiding Lifestyle Creep
While not strictly automation, avoiding lifestyle creep is a critical component of maximizing savings. Instead of upgrading their lifestyle with every raise (e.g., new car, bigger apartment), RSP millionaires prioritize upgrading their savings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Impact of Automation
The contrast between manual and automated saving is stark. Individuals who try to save manually often forget or find other uses for their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In contrast, those who automate their contributions consistently build wealth because the process occurs without their continuous conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Automation in Investment Strategy
Beyond contributions, automation also plays a role in a [[stoic_investing_approach_for_rsp_growth | stoic investing approach for RSP growth]]. Rather than reacting emotionally to market fluctuations, stoic investors follow a rules-based system, often enabled by automated investment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This ensures consistent investing regardless of short-term market noise, fear, or greed, and contributes to [[the_importance_of_having_a_clear_rrsp_investment_strategy | having a clear RRSP investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. They view market downturns as buying opportunities and continue investing, trusting that markets will recover and grow over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## The Overlooked Exit Strategy
While automation focuses on contributions and growth, even RSP millionaires can make a critical mistake: neglecting their RSP exit strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. RSPs are tax-deferred, meaning withdrawals in retirement are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Without a planned withdrawal strategy, individuals risk high tax rates or leaving heirs with a significant tax bill upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This underscores the need to address [[common_mistakes_in_rsp_withdrawal_strategies | common mistakes in RSP withdrawal strategies]]. Strategies to mitigate this include:
*   **Early Withdrawals:** Starting withdrawals before age 71 to spread taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **RSP to TFSA Conversion Strategy:** Shifting funds to a TFSA for tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Income Coordination:** Aligning RSP withdrawals with other income sources like CPP and OAS to avoid higher tax brackets and OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning:** Utilizing tools like life insurance policies to offset the tax burden upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

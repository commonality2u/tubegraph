Failing to report all income is a common, yet costly, [[common_tax_filing_mistakes | tax filing mistake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has comprehensive access to various income records and cross-checks them against filed tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Types of Income to Report

It is crucial to accurately report all sources of income, including:
*   Employment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Side hustle earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Investment dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Gains from selling or trading cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>

Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now directly report income to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Similarly, some cryptocurrency exchanges report transactions to the CRA, dispelling the [[misconceptions_about_income_tax | misconception]] that these transactions remain anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Consequences of Unreported Income

Failing to report all income can lead to severe consequences:
*   **Penalties and Audits** Unreported earnings can trigger an automatic reassessment from the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Specific Penalties** If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return, and have also missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a penalty of 10% of the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Tax Surprises** The CRA will "come knocking" if income sources are not accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Recommendations for Compliance

To avoid these costly penalties and issues, it is essential to ensure all income sources are accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Proactive Measures
*   **Verify Tax Slips** Always check your My CRA account to confirm that all tax slips are included before filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Maintain Records** Keeping accurate records of all income sources helps prevent costly tax surprises later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. For cryptocurrency, maintain detailed records of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Using Autofill My Return
The CRA's "Autofill My Return" tool, available in Net File certified tax software like TurboTax and Wealthsimple Tax, can significantly simplify the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>:
1.  **Instant Slip Pull** It automatically imports T4s, T5s, RRSP contributions, and other tax slips directly from the CRA when you log into your My CRA account and connect it to your tax software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Audit Prevention** This tool helps prevent common [[common_tax_filing_mistakes | mistakes]] like forgetting to report income (e.g., from a second job, dividends, or side hustles) by ensuring everything matches the CRA's records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
3.  **Time Savings and Credit Discovery** It eliminates manual entry, saves time, and helps identify missed credits and deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

By utilizing such tools and maintaining diligent records, taxpayers can ensure [[lessons_on_avoiding_tax_fraud_and_following_legal_tax_practices | compliance]] and avoid costly tax mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

The average Canadian's RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) balance saw a significant drop of over $30,000 in a single year, from 2022 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While this might initially cause concern about retirement savings, this decline is not as alarming as it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Recent Trends (2022-2023)

Average RRSP account values experienced a 28% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The national average dropped to $113,000 in 2023, down from approximately $144,000 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This reduction brings RRSP balances closer to historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, suggesting that the elevated levels observed in 2021 and 2022 were temporary spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These spikes were likely driven by pandemic-related savings habits, where people cut expenses and contributed more to their retirement funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The decline in 2023 reflects a return to more typical savings levels after the pandemic-induced boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite continued focus on financial futures, the rising cost of living and inflation are making it harder for Canadians to maintain higher contribution levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## [[median_vs_average_rrsp_balances | Median vs. Average RRSP Balances]]

To gain a more realistic view of Canadians' savings, it's crucial to examine median data alongside averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Medians are generally better indicators because averages can be skewed by very high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The most recent median data available (from 2019, combining RRSPs, RRIFs, and LRAs from StatCan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> reveals significant differences.

For individuals aged 65 and older, the median balance is $224,000, which is more than double the average of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This highlights how heavily the average numbers are influenced by high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Therefore, the median is a more suitable benchmark for personal comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### RRSP Holdings by Age Group (Median Data - 2019)

*   **Under 35**: The median savings for this group is a modest $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, indicating that many young adults have saved very little for retirement. It is crucial for them to start saving consistently as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **35 to 54 (Midlife Savings Growth)**: While savings improve, the median balance of $30,000 to $70,000 is still considerably below what is typically required for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Many in this age group are juggling mortgages, family expenses, and careers, making consistent retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **55 to 64 (Nearing Retirement)**: The median savings for this group increases to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, this is generally insufficient to sustain retirement comfortably, with some individuals in better shape having an average of over $216,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Many will still need to rely on additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **65+ (Retirees)**: The median savings for this group remains at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, implying that many retirees will heavily depend on government benefits like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) or other income streams, as private savings often won't cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Impact of Economic Family Types

The data also includes both combined households and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Households typically show higher savings due to shared financial responsibilities and additional incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For example, two-person households have 4.2 million contributors to RRSPs with a median contribution of $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, while single-person households contribute significantly less, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This pattern indicates that dual-income households are generally better positioned to prioritize and grow their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Regional Breakdowns

A 2023 survey provides insights into regional RRSP performance across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>:
*   **Ontario** leads with the highest average RRSP balance, at $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Canada** boasted the highest average contribution at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Despite regional variations, Canadians across the country remain engaged with their RRSPs, whether by building large account balances or making consistent contributions annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Contribution Trends

In 2023, the average RRSP contribution grew to $651, up from $575 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, demonstrating a continued focus on retirement savings despite economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Contributions vary by age group:
*   The **55 and above** age group contributes a median of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Younger Canadians, specifically the **15 to 24** age group, contribute a median of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This indicates that as Canadians approach retirement, they tend to prioritize growing their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## [[economic_challenges_affecting_rrsp_contributions | Economic Challenges Impacting RRSP Savings]]

Saving for retirement has faced recent challenges, primarily due to inflation and rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   In 2023, 74% of Canadians expressed concerns about how inflation and rising prices affected their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   By 2024, 63% of Canadians still reported that current economic conditions negatively impacted their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, Canadians show resilience by continuing to focus on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Key Observations and Insights

The most surprising aspect of this data is the similarity in balances between those earning $25,000 and $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Despite the wide income span, their average balances remain very close, suggesting that many middle-income Canadians are maximizing their [[TFSA]]s even with less disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This highlights the value of [[TFSA]]s for all income levels, not just high earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

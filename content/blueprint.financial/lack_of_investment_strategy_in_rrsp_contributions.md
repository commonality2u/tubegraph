Many Canadians regret [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions|contributing to an RSP]] without a solid investment plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Without a clear strategy, individuals often either freeze due to too many choices, or take on excessive risk, both of which can negatively impact long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Too Many Investment Choices Lead to Paralysis

[[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions|RSPs]] allow investments in various assets including stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, GICs, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. However, this overwhelming number of options can lead to decision paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Some contributors leave their [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions|RSP]] funds sitting in cash or low-interest savings, missing out on years of potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Others may blindly follow high-fee mutual fund recommendations from banks, unaware of how these fees erode their long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Many express regret for not having a clear strategy from the outset and wishing they had researched investment options before contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Taking On Too Much Risk Causes Stress

Some [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions|RSP]] holders invest heavily in high-risk stocks hoping for significant gains, without fully understanding market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. When the market experiences a downturn, panic can set in, leading to hasty decisions and selling investments at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Many investors regret not diversifying their portfolio, realizing too late that risk without a coherent strategy is akin to gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Playing It Too Safe Hurts Growth

Conversely, some investors are overly conservative, keeping their [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions|RSPs]] in low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or money market funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. While this approach avoids volatility, it often means the money barely keeps pace with inflation, thereby limiting potential retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Years later, many realize their savings did not grow sufficiently, regretting their lack of a more balanced approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid RRSP Investment Regrets

To avoid these common [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions|RSP]] investment regrets, it is crucial to start with a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Don't simply contribute for the tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Instead, choose investments that align with your individual risk tolerance, balancing growth-oriented assets like stocks with more stable options like bonds to mitigate extreme risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Opt for low-cost ETFs or index funds over high-fee mutual funds, and ensure your cash is not left sitting idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

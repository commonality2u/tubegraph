When planning for retirement, one of the most common questions is how and when to withdraw from Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While many focus on contributing to and growing RSPs, the importance of a strategic withdrawal plan is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Withdrawals from RSPs are taxed as income in the year they are taken out, which can push an individual into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For example, in 2024, combined federal and provincial tax brackets in Ontario can exceed 50% for high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Therefore, careful planning of RSP withdrawals for years with lower anticipated tax brackets is crucial to minimize tax burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Strategic Early Withdrawal to Maximize CPP and OAS

One key strategy involves maximizing government pensions by [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP benefits]] and Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This approach prioritizes withdrawing from RSPs and Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) to cover income needs during the delay period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### How it Works

Instead of starting [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP benefits]] at age 65, individuals can choose to [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delay it]] until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. If income is needed during this time, withdrawals from RSPs and RRIFs can be used to cover expenses until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This can result in a substantial increase in [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

*   **CPP Benefits**:
    *   Starting [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP]] at age 60 results in a 0.6% reduction per month compared to age 65, totaling 36% less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   [[delaying_cpp_benefits | Delaying CPP benefits]] until age 70 results in a 0.7% increase per month compared to age 65, totaling 42% more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   For example, a $1,000/month [[estimating_your_cpp_benefits | CPP benefit]] at age 65 would become $1,420/month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **OAS Benefits**:
    *   Receiving OAS at age 65 provides the full benefit amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
    *   [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying OAS]] until age 70 results in 36% more than what would be received at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   For example, a $600/month full OAS benefit at age 65 would become approximately $816/month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Benefits of this Strategy

*   **Increased CPP and OAS Payments**: This strategy leads to significantly higher payments from these government programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **More Financial Security**: It offers greater certainty by trading the uncertain returns of an RSP for the guaranteed, inflation-indexed returns of [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Avoiding OAS Clawbacks**: Strategically managing income can help avoid OAS clawbacks, which occur if net income exceeds specific thresholds (e.g., $86,900) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This can potentially lead to over $9,000 gained each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Downsides of this Strategy

*   **Health Concerns**: This strategy may not be suitable for individuals with poor health or a family history of shorter lifespans, as starting benefits earlier might yield more total benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It makes more sense for those in good health with a family history of longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Loss of Tax-Sheltered Status**: Some individuals are uncomfortable with withdrawing too much from RSPs, which results in losing their tax-sheltered status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Minimizing RSP Taxes on Death

Another related strategy is to minimize RSP taxes on death. When an individual passes away, the entire balance in their RSP is considered income for that year and is taxed accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Why it's Crucial

*   **Preserving Wealth**: Reducing the tax burden ensures more savings go to beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Large Tax Hits**: Without planning, a large RSP balance could push an estate into the highest marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Efficient Estate Planning**: Proper strategies streamline wealth transfer for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Strategies to Minimize Taxes on Death

*   **Gradual RSP Withdrawal**: Drawing out RSP funds gradually during retirement, especially in low-income years, reduces the balance and minimizes the tax hit upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Spousal Rollover**: Naming a spouse or common-law partner as beneficiary allows a tax-free transfer of the RSP or RRIF to them, continuing to grow tax-sheltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Income Splitting

[[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | Income splitting]] with RSPs involves transferring income from a higher-earning spouse to a lower-earning spouse to reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

*   **Process**:
    1.  Convert RSP to a RRIF once you turn 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    2.  Allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income (including RRIF withdrawals) to your spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    3.  This is done on your tax return, reducing the combined taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Tax Filing**: Both spouses must complete Form T1032, "Joint Election to Split Pension Income," and include it with their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Using Your TFSA Wisely with Your RSP

Using Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) withdrawals can supplement income while minimizing taxes, complementing RSP and government benefits like [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP]] and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Unlike RSP, [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP]], and OAS withdrawals, TFSA withdrawals do not count towards your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This allows control over taxable income and helps stay in a desired tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Managing Excess Funds**: Excess funds from RSP withdrawals (e.g., to reduce RSP taxes on death) can be contributed to a TFSA, where they continue to grow tax-free and can be accessed without additional taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Benefit Qualification**: Since TFSA withdrawals are not considered income, they do not affect eligibility for government benefits like OAS or Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Ensure sufficient TFSA contribution room before attempting this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## RSP Meltdown Strategy (RSP Freeze)

This complex strategy involves taking out a large investment loan where the interest payments are tax-deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. RSP withdrawals are then used to pay the loan interest, offsetting the taxable income from the RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **Advantages**: Tax savings from deductible interest payments and benefits from lower tax rates on capital gains and dividends in a non-registered investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Downsides**:
    *   **Market Risk**: Investments may not perform as expected, leading to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
    *   **Interest Rate Risk**: Rising interest rates can significantly increase borrowing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
    *   **Complexity**: This strategy requires careful planning, constant monitoring, and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Suitability**: This strategy is generally not recommended for the majority of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. It might suit individuals with a very high risk tolerance, high passive income, a large RSP portfolio, and other significant retirement income sources, provided they are willing to accept potential very big losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

## Orchestrating Your Retirement Income

Managing RSPs, TFSAs, OAS, and [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP]] requires a harmonious approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Strategic timing of RSP withdrawals ensures maximum benefit from retirement savings without unnecessary taxes or loss of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. For example, high RSP withdrawals could lead to OAS and GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

There is no one-size-fits-all method for RSP withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Some may benefit from early RSP withdrawals for a larger [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | CPP]], while others might prefer minimizing withdrawals to grow their RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. The best approach depends on individual financial goals and unique situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

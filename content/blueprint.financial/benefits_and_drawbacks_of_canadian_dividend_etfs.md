## Top Canadian Dividend ETFs

Here are some of the [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | top Canadian dividend ETFs]], along with their features, benefits, and considerations:

### 1. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

*   **Purpose** Designed for investors seeking steady, high-quality dividends from strong Canadian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, selecting stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Key Features**
    *   Holds 31 highest-yielding Canadian stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Provides monthly distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Nearly 60% of the ETF is concentrated in Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Performance & Costs**
    *   Dividend Yield: Approximately 4.2% (as of January 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   Annual Performance (2024): 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Management Expense Ratio (MER): 0.55% per year, which is moderate for a high-yield strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Assets Under Management (AUM): $1.76 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings** Dominated by Canadian financials, including Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor** Great for retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts and exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Not suitable for growth investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### 2. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

*   **Purpose** An income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks and employs a covered call strategy to enhance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy provides higher monthly dividends but limits upside potential in stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Covered Call Strategy** ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks to earn premiums, capping potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If stock prices remain flat or fall, the premium is profit. If prices rise above the strike price, ZWC sells at the set price, missing out on larger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This means it trades growth potential for stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Key Features**
    *   Enhanced income strategy using covered calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   Monthly distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Performance & Costs**
    *   Dividend Yield: 6.62% (as of Feb 2025), higher due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   Annual Performance (2024): 12% return, but a very low 5-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   MER: 0.72% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   Trading Expense Ratio: 0.2%, leading to a total cost of 0.92%, making it the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   AUM: $1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings** Heavily weighted towards financials and energy, including Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor** Best for retirees and income seekers prioritizing consistent cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Suitable for RSP and TFSA investors who don't need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Not ideal for growth-focused investors due to capped gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Holding in a TFSA can shield high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### 3. iShares S&P TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)

*   **Purpose** Invests in Canadian companies that have increased their dividends for at least five consecutive years (Dividend Aristocrats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It's a solid choice for stable dividend growth and monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Key Features**
    *   Dividend growth focus: includes stocks with a proven track record of raising dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   Broad diversification: holds 91 stocks across multiple sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

    *   Annual Performance (2024): 20.07% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

    *   AUM: $940 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings** Less concentrated in financials compared to other dividend ETFs, with holdings like BCE, Allied Properties REIT, Fiera Capital, Telus, and Southcorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This diversification helps reduce risk compared to bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor** Great for dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Not ideal for maximum yield seekers due to lower dividend rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### 4. Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VDY)

*   **Key Features**
    *   Low cost: MER of 0.22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

    *   AUM: $2.49 billion, making it a very large ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   Number of Holdings: 56 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings** Heavily weighted in financials and energy, including RBC, TD, CNR, Enbridge, and Bank of Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The top 10 holdings make up 70.6% of the fund, indicating high concentration in a few major sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor** Great for dividend investors looking for strong, stable income and comfortable with financials and energy sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Not ideal for diversification seekers as over 85% is in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### 5. iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XDIV)

*   **Ideal Investor** Great for cost-conscious investors seeking dividend income with low fees and those who want a mix of financial and energy stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Not ideal for diversification seekers due to concentration in just 20 holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Drawbacks of Canadian Dividend ETFs

Despite their popularity, Canadian dividend ETFs have several downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Higher Fees

*   Dividend ETFs often have higher-than-average Management Expense Ratios (MERs) that can significantly reduce returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. For example, XDV charges a 0.55% MER for only 31 stocks, which offers limited diversification for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A $1,000 investment in XDV would incur $5.50 in fees per year, which compounds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. To mitigate this, consider dividend ETFs with lower MERs, like XDIV or VDY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Limited Diversification

*   Many Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in the financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For example, VDY has over 85% exposure to just these two sectors, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   Furthermore, some of these ETFs hold a limited number of stocks (e.g., XDV holds 31 stocks, XDIV holds only 20 stocks), meaning they do not provide broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This contrasts with truly diversified ETFs like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO), which holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For true diversification, [[limitations_of_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | dividend ETFs alone might not be sufficient]], and investors might consider building their own diversified portfolio or choosing a globally diversified ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Better Alternatives

*   **US Dividend Stocks** Many of the best dividend stocks are found in the US market, offering higher dividend growth rates, potentially more sector diversification, and more global "Blue Chip" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might be better off investing directly in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
    *   Another strategy is to combine a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   [[risks_of_keeping_noncanadian_dividend_stocks_in_tfsas | For US dividend stocks]], it is advisable to hold them in an RSP rather than a TFSA to avoid withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This is a key [[strategies_for_taxefficient_investment_in_canada | tax-saving strategy for investments in Canada]] and crucial for [[tax_saving_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | tax-efficient investment in Canada]].
*   **Individual Stock Picking** Investors could also pick their own individual dividend stocks to control diversification and fees.
*   **Globally Diversified ETFs** For comprehensive market exposure, globally diversified ETFs like VGRO offer a much broader range of stocks and sectors compared to most Canadian dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

While Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool for investors who prefer not to select individual dividend stocks, their high fees, limited diversification, and lack of control are important considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

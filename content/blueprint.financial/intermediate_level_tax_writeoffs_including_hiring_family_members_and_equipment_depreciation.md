For small business owners, understanding and utilizing tax write-offs is crucial to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize your deductions]] and retain more of your earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Beyond the [[simple_tax_deductions_for_small_businesses_in_canada | simplest tax deductions for small businesses in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, there are intermediate-level deductions that, while requiring a bit more involvement, can result in substantial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Hiring a Family Member

You can deduct salaries paid to [[family_tax_planning | family members]] if the salary is reasonable and accurately reflects the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. It's important to treat the employment of [[family_tax_planning | family members]] like any other employee to avoid issues with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This approach can help manage your business finances effectively and keep funds within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

*   **Example:** If you hire your son to manage social media accounts at $20 per hour for 20 hours a week, the annual salary of $20,800 (1,040 hours x $20/hour) is a fully deductible business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This deduction reduces your business's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Equipment Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance - CCA)

When purchasing assets like computers, machinery, or furniture for your business, you cannot deduct the full cost in the year of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Instead, you depreciate the cost over several years, which is known as Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The CRA has specific classes for different asset types, each with its own depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

*   **Examples of Depreciation Rates:**
    *   Computers fall under Class 50 with a 55% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Furniture falls under Class 8 with a 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Example:** If you purchase a computer for $2,000 (Class 50, 55% rate), you can claim $1,100 ($2,000 x 55%) in the first year, with the remaining balance depreciated in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Interest on Business Loans

If you've taken out a loan to finance your business operations, the interest payments are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This applies to various types of loans, including lines of credit, term loans, and even certain credit card interest, provided the expenses are business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It's crucial to separate business loan interest from personal loan interest, as only interest on loans used specifically for business purposes can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

*   **Example:** Interest paid on a loan taken out to purchase new equipment for your business is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Commercial Insurance Premiums

Premiums paid for insurance on your business assets, such as property, equipment, and inventory, are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This includes policies that cover losses from fire, theft, and other damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

*   **Example:** If you insure your office building and equipment, the premiums paid can be deducted from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

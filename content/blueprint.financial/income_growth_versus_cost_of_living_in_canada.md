Canada is currently experiencing a significant [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Approximately 50% of Canadians are living paycheck to paycheck, according to Equifax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This financial strain has led 40% of recent immigrants to consider moving to another province or leaving Canada entirely, primarily due to the high cost of living, as reported by an Angus Reid poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Rising Cost of Everyday Items

The primary reason for widespread financial struggle among Canadians is that income growth has not kept pace with the rapidly increasing cost of living <a class="yt-00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Food Costs
[[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada|Food prices]] have seen a dramatic increase, outpacing the average rate of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A basket of 18 household items that cost $82 in March 2021 now costs $113.32, a 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   The latest Canada Food Price Report predicts an additional increase of about $701 in the average family of four's annual food bill this year, bringing the total average to $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This follows a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Housing Costs
[[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada|Shelter costs]] have also become significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Rent:** In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. By July 2024, this average reached $3,648 per month, a 40% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Home Ownership:** The average cost to buy a house in Canada was $413,000 in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. By May 2024, this average had skyrocketed to $699,000, a staggering 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Beyond food and housing, costs for transportation, entertainment, and general goods have also risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Income Growth in Canada

Unfortunately, [[influence_of_income_growth_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada|income growth]] has not kept pace with the rising [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   According to Statistics Canada, the median after-tax income of Canadian families and unattached individuals was $70,500 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   This represents a decrease from $73,000 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   It is likely that [[average_income_in_canada_by_age|average wages]] have not significantly increased in 2023 or 2024 either, certainly not enough to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Consequences of the Disparity

The significant gap between stagnant income growth and soaring [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada]] has led to widespread financial struggles for many Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. The discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs have further strained finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Many Canadians are considering moving:
*   28% (almost a third) of all Canadians are thinking about leaving their current province due to high housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Young adults and renters are most likely to consider such a move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, with this trend being particularly pronounced in Ontario and British Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Popular relocation spots include Alberta, which offers more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Between 2022 and 2023, net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Furthermore, unhappiness is widespread, particularly among Canadian youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While Canada ranks 15th happiest overall in the World Happiness Report by Gallup World Poll, Canadians under age 30 fall to 58th place, highlighting a significant disparity and painting a bleak picture for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Out-of-the-Box Solutions

While not applicable to everyone, some alternative solutions can help mitigate the high [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada]]:
*   **Tiny Houses:** Consider living in compact, efficient homes (200-400 sq ft) to save on housing costs and embrace a minimalist lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

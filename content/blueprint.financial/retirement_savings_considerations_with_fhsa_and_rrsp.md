When considering retirement savings, both the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) offer significant benefits, though they serve different primary purposes. While the RRSP is traditionally seen as the "go-to choice" for retirement due to its higher contribution limits and focus on retirement, the FHSA can also play a flexible and powerful role in long-term savings strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## FHSA as a Flexible Retirement Tool

The FHSA offers flexibility even if a home purchase isn't the immediate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:02">[06:00:02]</a>.
*   **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to $40,000 to the FHSA over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Advantages**: Contributions are tax deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an upfront tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Potential**: Both accounts offer tax-deferred growth on investments like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs, allowing for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. This means the [[investment_potential_in_fhsa_and_rrsp | investment potential in FHSA and RRSP]] is a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.
*   **Transfer to RRSP**: A key benefit is that if you decide not to buy a home within 15 years, the FHSA balance can be transferred into your RRSP without losing any tax advantages or contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This allows the FHSA to act as a "bridge" to the RRSP, offering the same growth potential with added flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: This provides flexibility to take advantage of tax-free withdrawals for a house, and if plans change, funds can be transferred to an RRSP without penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. A client, upon learning this, chose to contribute to her FHSA first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

The FHSA is considered an ideal starting point for both first-time home buyers and long-term retirement planners due to its tax-free withdrawals for a home and the flexibility to roll into an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## RRSP for Retirement Savings

The RRSP has higher contribution limits, allowing up to 18% of your income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. While traditionally focused on retirement, its primary function is to provide tax-deferred growth until withdrawal in retirement. However, there are [[challenges_with_rrsp_withdrawals_in_retirement | challenges with RRSP withdrawals in retirement]] as they are eventually taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## Situations Where RRSP is Advantageous

There are specific [[situations_where_rrsp_is_advantageous_over_fhsa | situations where RRSP is advantageous over FHSA]] and becomes the smarter choice for retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>:

*   **Investing in US Stocks**: If you are investing in US stocks, dividends earned in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, this tax is avoided entirely when investing through an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Therefore, it is a pro tip to invest in US stocks through your RRSP to bypass this withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Matching**: If your employer offers to match your RRSP contributions, this is essentially "free money" that significantly boosts your retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. For example, if an employer matches $5,000, your RRSP could grow by $10,000 that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

In these specific cases, the RRSP takes the lead for long-term investors and those with strong work benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Overall, the FHSA often "wins in most categories over the RSP" for general savings, including flexibility and [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax benefits of FHSA versus RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. Even if you're not saving to buy a home, the FHSA typically comes out ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. The only times it makes more sense to prioritize an RRSP for retirement savings are if you are heavily investing in US dividend stocks or if you receive employer matching contributions to your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.

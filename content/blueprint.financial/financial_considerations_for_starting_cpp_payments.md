Deciding when to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] payments is one of the most impactful retirement choices Canadians can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Over 95% of Canadians begin receiving [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at or before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, for many individuals, waiting until age 70 often proves to be [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments|optimal]], potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This decision is like a retirement jigsaw puzzle, where pieces like life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams must fit together to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Benefits]]: Understanding Start Ages

Most Canadians claim [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at age 60, with over 70% starting their benefits at either age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, there are many more options to consider, including ages 61 to 64 and 66 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Starting at Age 60

Choosing to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at age 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This option is generally best for those who need immediate income or have health concerns leading to a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Permanent Drawbacks**: The 36% reduction significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those living beyond age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Potential**: If investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at 60 allows for investing payments and potentially coming out ahead, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations**: Starting at 60 can help avoid clawbacks on [[Delaying CPP and OAS payments|Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] for low-income retirees, smoothing income across retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario**: John, a 60-year-old with health issues and little savings, takes [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] early to secure income and avoid GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Starting at Age 65

This default option strikes a balance, providing steady payments and avoiding the need for savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy and moderate [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts|estimated investment returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

*   **Predictable Income**: Standard [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] benefits offer reliable, inflation-adjusted income without requiring additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Tradeoffs**: This option leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis**: Payments equalize with the 70 option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those unsure of longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario**: Maria, aged 65, retires with modest RSP savings and average health. She takes [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] now to maintain predictable income without depleting savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Delaying to Age 70

[[Benefits of delaying CPP payments|Delaying CPP payments]] to age 70 provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, increasing payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for those with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

*   **Longevity Protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to around 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age**: For most, [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits|delaying CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments start to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario**: Susan, aged 70, expects to live well into her late 80s or 90s with sufficient RSP funds. She delays [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]], maximizing her lifetime inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

For instance, if Sarah qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, she'd receive $640 per month at 60, but her monthly payments would jump to $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Key Factors in [[Optimal age to start CPP payments|Optimal Age to Start CPP Payments]]

The decision of when to take [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] largely depends on two key factors: your predicted investment returns and your life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Estimating Life Expectancy

Estimating how long you'll live is a crucial piece of the [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

A 2020 Actuarial study on [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] take-up decisions highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

*   **Gender Differences**: Women tend to live longer than men, with 82% of women likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. [[Advantages of delaying CPP benefits|Delaying CPP]] is especially beneficial for women for secure, inflation-protected income later in years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Longevity Expectations**: A healthy lifestyle or a family history of long life increases odds to 79% for men and 85% for women, making [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits|delayed CPP]] a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Delaying**: Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80, suggesting most retirees would benefit from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Stats Canada data also indicates that the older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82 on average, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

*   **Longer Life Expectancy**: Life expectancy in Canada is generally longer than the conventional wisdom of around 80 or 82, especially for those already middle-aged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Women Benefit More**: Women live longer across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s, making [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments|delaying CPP to age 70]] advantageous for higher inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Men's Considerations**: Men with shorter life expectancies should balance longevity with financial needs and carefully consider their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Longevity Insurance**: [[Delaying CPP and OAS payments|Delaying CPP]] acts as a safety net, particularly for women who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning**: Integrating [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] timing with strategies like RSP withdrawals and TFSA savings ensures optimized retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

#### Life Expectancy Calculators and Refinement Methods
Several online calculators can provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Examples include:

*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits, quick to complete, and offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, it dives deeper into health and habits, providing personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

While these tools offer tailored outlooks, their results can differ (e.g., by 4 years), so they should be taken with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

To further refine life expectancy estimates, consider:
*   **Genetic Testing**: Uncovers potential health predispositions and longevity factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations**: Identifies modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing**: Advanced tests that measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings**: Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes can significantly impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## [[Estimating CPP benefits|Estimating CPP Benefits]]: Using a Present Value Calculator

While comparing to a [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] break-even table is a good starting point, it falls short by not considering factors like the investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A [[estimating_cpp_benefits|CPP present value calculator]] incorporates these additional factors for a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### How to Use the Calculator (e.g., TaxTips.ca)

The calculator allows you to fill in variables to assess the present value of different [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] start ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>:

*   **Estimated Monthly Benefit at Age 65**: Defaulted to $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Estimated Annual Indexation of [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] (Inflation Rate)**: Defaulted to 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Start Ages to Evaluate**: Typically 60, 65, and 70, but can include other ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Life Expectancy**: Your estimated age of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Rate of Return**: Your estimated current or expected portfolio return, often chosen conservatively (e.g., 3-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

#### Interpreting Results and Impact of Variables

The calculator provides a "present value" for choosing [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. For example, if a woman living to 86 with a 2% rate of return is used, delaying to 70 yields the highest present value (e.g., $320,000 compared to $222,000 at 60 and $286,000 at 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

*   **Impact of Rate of Return**: A higher rate of return (e.g., 4% or 6%) can significantly even out the present values between different start ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Impact of Life Expectancy**:
    *   **Longer Life (e.g., to 100)**: Age 70 becomes the clear best choice, providing significantly more value (e.g., $130,000 present value over age 60, and cumulative payments can be vastly greater, like $1,000,000 vs. $550,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Shorter Life (e.g., to 72)**: Starting at age 60 is typically best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Impact of Inflation Rate**: High inflation rates (e.g., 4%) generally still favor delaying to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Lower inflation rates (e.g., 1%) can make the present values for different start ages much closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Predicting inflation rates is almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

## Comprehensive Planning for [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]]

Deciding when to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] is a complex puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Beyond individual calculations, a comprehensive approach considers additional factors:

*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points**: Analyzing how long you're likely to live and when [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_payments|delaying CPP]] starts to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   [[Tax implications of CPP|Tax Strategies]]: How [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] income interacts with your overall tax situation, which can significantly reduce or increase your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   [[Delaying CPP and OAS payments|OAS Clawback Mitigation]]: Whether [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments|delaying CPP]] can help avoid or mitigate the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback penalty, or if starting earlier is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Often, delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] into the late 60s or 70s shows benefits for clients, though exceptions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Evaluating various scenarios is crucial to unlock the full potential of your [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] with strategies customized to your life expectancy, taxes, and retirement goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

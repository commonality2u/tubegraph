One of the easiest yet most impactful mistakes to correct regarding your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is incorrectly naming your heir. If you are married or in a common-law relationship, it is crucial to name your spouse as a successor holder for your TFSA, rather than just a beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Why it Matters: Beneficiary vs. Successor Holder

The distinction between a beneficiary and a successor holder can have significant financial implications for your surviving spouse.

### When a Spouse is Named as Beneficiary

Consider Jack, who has a TFSA with $100,000 and names his spouse, Jill, as the beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When Jack passes away:
*   Jill inherits the $100,000, but the TFSA is immediately closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Jill must transfer the funds to a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Any future gains on that $100,000 become subject to tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The TFSA contribution room is lost forever, meaning future growth isn't tax-sheltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   For instance, if Jill earns a 5% annual return on $100,000, she could owe taxes on $5,000 in gains each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### When a Spouse is Named as Successor Holder

If Jack names Jill as a successor holder instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   Jill takes over the TFSA completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The $100,000 remains within the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   All future gains continue to be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Jill's own [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA contribution room]] remains unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, allowing her to continue contributing to her own account while benefiting from the tax-free growth of Jack's TFSA as if it were her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
    *   In the same example, if Jill earns a 5% return on $100,000, she would owe no taxes on the $5,000 annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This keeps her money working harder for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Solution

This crucial update is remarkably simple to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>:
*   Contact your bank or TFSA provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Request to update your account to name your partner as a successor holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This quick 10-minute task can prevent your loved ones from losing out on substantial tax-free growth in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

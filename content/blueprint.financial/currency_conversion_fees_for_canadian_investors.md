Canadian investors frequently lose money without realizing it due to hidden currency conversion, or FX, fees when investing in US stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## What Are FX Fees?

Every time Canadian dollars (CAD) are converted to US dollars (USD) or vice versa, most brokerage firms impose an FX fee, typically ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These fees accumulate rapidly, diminishing investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Why FX Fees Matter

Consider an example where an investor wishes to invest $50,000 CAD into Apple stock, requiring a conversion to USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If the broker charges a 2% FX fee, $1,000 is immediately lost, leaving only $49,000 available for purchasing Apple shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Should the investor later sell the shares and convert the proceeds back to CAD, another 2% FX fee would be charged, incurring an additional $1,000 loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Even if the investment was profitable, $2,000 would be lost solely to currency conversion fees, not including other trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. For investors who frequently trade US stocks or rebalance their portfolios, these hidden fees can amount to tens of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, money that could otherwise have compounded within their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## How to Avoid or Minimize FX Fees

Several strategies can help reduce or avoid currency conversion fees:
*   **Use Discount Brokerages**: Opt for discount brokerages that offer much lower FX fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Interactive Brokers is noted as having some of the lowest FX fees in Canada, though it may not be the most user-friendly platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Norbert's Gambit**: Employ Norbert's Gambit, a tactic where an interlisted stock is purchased, journaled to the other currency, and then sold to largely avoid FX fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This method is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Maintain a US Dollar Brokerage Account**: Keeping a US dollar brokerage account allows investors to trade US stocks without converting CAD to USD for each transaction, thereby avoiding repetitive fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Retirement should be a time to enjoy the fruits of your labor, but for Canadians, Old Age Security (OAS) payments can be significantly reduced by the government's "clawback" if not managed carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Understanding and implementing [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | tax strategies for investments]] can help minimize your taxable income and preserve these benefits.

## Understanding the OAS Clawback (Recovery Tax)

The OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax, reduces your OAS benefits when your income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   For the 2024 income year, the clawback kicks in when income exceeds $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   The maximum annual OAS benefit can be $9,481 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   A 15% recovery tax is applied to the amount of income over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   If your income reaches or exceeds $153,700, the entire OAS amount can be clawed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] David's OAS Clawback
> David, a 75-year-old, has an income of $160,000 in 2024, which is well over the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 15% recovery tax on the amount over the threshold totals $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Since David's annual OAS benefit of $9,481 is below this recovery tax amount, he will lose all of his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the OAS Clawback

Minimizing taxable income is key to preserving OAS benefits. Here are several [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | tax-saving strategies]] to achieve this:

### 1. Delay Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Payments
Delaying your CPP payments until a later age (e.g., 68, 69, or 70) can significantly reduce your taxable income between ages 65 and 70, when the OAS clawback often begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP can increase your payments by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Higher CPP payments are indexed to inflation, growing in value over your lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Peter Parker's CPP Delay
> Peter experiences an OAS clawback of $811 at age 65 due to high taxable income from CPP and other retirement sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By delaying CPP, his taxable income is reduced, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $584. This represents a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback by just delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 2. Delay Old Age Security (OAS) Payments
Consider delaying your OAS payments up to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   This increases your monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   Delaying OAS can reduce or eliminate the clawback during earlier retirement years when your income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Peter Parker's OAS Delay
> Peter faces an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income. By delaying OAS until age 70, the entire clawback is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This strategy allows him to avoid benefit reductions during his higher-income years and receive a higher monthly OAS payment (36% increase) after age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Important Consideration
> Delaying CPP and OAS is not always the best option. If you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy, delaying may not be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Personalized planning is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### 3. Use Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) Wisely
A TFSA is an excellent tool to avoid the OAS clawback because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This means you can access funds for living expenses without increasing your taxable income, helping you stay below the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] TFSA Withdrawals
> If you withdraw $20,000 per year from a $100,000 TFSA for living expenses, you pay no taxes on this amount, and it doesn't count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This is especially helpful if your taxable income is close to the OAS clawback threshold of $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. In contrast, withdrawing the same $20,000 from a taxable account like an RRSP could trigger the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

> [!TIP] The RSP-TFSA Ladder for [[tfsa_investment_strategies | TFSA Investment Strategies]]
> Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This can keep your taxable income lower later on and allow for tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement, minimizing the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting
[[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | Pension income splitting]] is a valuable [[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | strategy to reduce taxes]] for couples, especially if one spouse earns significantly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. You can transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Peter and Mary Jane's Pension Income Splitting
> Peter earns $60,000 annually from his pension, while Mary Jane earns much less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. By splitting, Peter can transfer $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This reduces Peter's taxable income to $30,000, putting him in a lower tax bracket and reducing the risk of the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Mary Jane, in a lower tax bracket, is taxed on the $30,000, leading to less overall tax for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### 5. Manage Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) Withdrawals
When your RRSP converts to a RRIF at age 71, you must start making minimum annual withdrawals, which are taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These withdrawals can push your income over the OAS clawback threshold if not managed carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. [[strategies_to_minimize_taxes_with_a_rrif | Strategies to minimize taxes with a RRIF]] include:
*   Using your younger spouse's age to reduce the withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Tapping into non-taxable accounts like a TFSA first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Peter and Mary Jane's RRIF Strategy
> Peter (71) and Mary Jane (65) can use Mary Jane's younger age to reduce Peter's required RRIF withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Normally, Peter would withdraw 5.28% at age 71. By basing it on Mary Jane's age, the rate drops to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. For a $200,000 RRIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering their taxable income by $2,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This reduction helps them stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### 6. Invest Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts
The type of income from non-registered accounts can significantly impact your taxable income and trigger the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | Tax efficient investment strategies in Canada]] suggest being mindful of how different income types are taxed:
*   **Interest income** (bonds, GICs, savings accounts) is fully taxable at your marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Capital gains** are taxed at only 50% of your marginal tax rate (if under the $250k threshold), making them more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on Growth Investments
> By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, you can reduce your taxable income and stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. For example, $10,000 in interest income is fully taxed, but $10,000 in capital gains only results in $5,000 being taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### 7. Capture Capital Gains Before Age 65
Timing is crucial when managing capital gains to avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. By realizing capital gains before you turn 65, you can avoid large taxable events once OAS payments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   A smart approach is to realize these gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   This allows you to pay taxes earlier and avoid increasing your taxable income during retirement when OAS kicks in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Selling Assets Before Age 65
> If you plan to sell property or investments for a $50,000 gain, doing so at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain won't count toward your taxable income during the crucial years when OAS begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This keeps you under the clawback threshold and can save you thousands in reduced benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Effective [[strategies_for_maximizing_retirement_income | strategies for maximizing retirement income]] involve awareness of how delaying CPP and OAS, using your TFSA, and managing RRIF withdrawals can help you avoid the OAS clawback and keep more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. These smart moves can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

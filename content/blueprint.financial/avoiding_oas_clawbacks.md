[[oas_clawback_explanation | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits can be reduced if your income exceeds a certain threshold, a process known as an OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This article outlines [[strategies_to_avoid_oas_clawback | strategies to avoid OAS clawbacks]] by effectively managing your income.

## Understanding the OAS Clawback Threshold

Large Registered Income Fund (RIF) withdrawals, along with other sources of income, can push your total income above the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. As of 2024, this threshold is approximately $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Exceeding this limit will result in a reduction of your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | OAS benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid OAS Clawbacks

### Coordinate Withdrawals with Tax-Free Income Sources

One effective method is to coordinate your RIF withdrawals with tax-free income sources, such as Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

> David, at age 72, withdraws $20,000 annually from his $200,000 RIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By supplementing his income with TFSA withdrawals, he manages to keep his taxable income below the clawback threshold, thereby preserving his [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | OAS benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Balance RIF Withdrawals with Other Income Streams

To manage taxes and prevent OAS clawbacks, it is crucial to balance RIF withdrawals with other income sources like Canada Pension Plan (CPP), [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | OAS]], TFSAs, and other accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. A mix of taxable and tax-free income can maximize your after-tax retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

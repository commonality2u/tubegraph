From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

The Canadian Finance Minister recently announced a delay to the proposed capital gains tax hike, pushing its implementation to January 1st, 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This proposed change would increase the inclusion rate of capital gains from 50% to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Introduced in June 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, the tax hike now faces significant legal and political challenges that could halt it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Current Challenges and Pressures

Several factors are contributing to the uncertainty surrounding the capital gains tax hike:

*   **Political Opposition**: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has pledged to repeal the tax if elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Trade Disputes**: New tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Canadian imports add pressure to the Canadian economy, making the tax hike less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Legal Challenges**: The Canadian Taxpayers Federation is suing the government, arguing the CRA lacks legal authority to collect a higher tax because the legislation was never officially passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. A court ruling against the government could strike down the increase before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Internal Liberal Party Dissension**: Support within the Liberal Party is reportedly "crumbling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Chrystia Freeland, the former Finance Minister who initially introduced the change, has stated she would scrap it if she became Liberal leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Other leadership candidates are also distancing themselves from the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Pierre Poilievre's Stance and Election Odds

Pierre Poilievre views the tax hike as a "direct attack" on investors, business owners, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, arguing it harms investments, slows business growth, and reduces Canada's global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. He has promised to reverse it if elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Betting markets suggest a high probability of a Conservative victory in the next federal election, which is set for October 20, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Poilievre's Conservative Party has odds of minus 2,000 to win, indicating approximately a 95% chance of victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Given these odds, a tax reversal seems highly likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Arguments For and Against Reversal

### Reasons Against Reversal
*   **Revenue Loss**: The tax was projected to generate around $17 billion over five years, intended for housing, dental care, and pharmacare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Reversing it would require the government to find alternative revenue sources or cut spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Tax on the Wealthy**: The Liberals framed this as a measure to make wealthier Canadians contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. A rollback could be perceived as benefiting the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Reasons For Reversal
*   **Harm to Business Growth**: Higher [[capital_gains_tax_deferral_in_canada | capital gains taxes]] can discourage investments, slow business exits, and limit reinvestment within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **US Tariff Threats**: New US tariffs could push businesses and investments towards the United States, and an additional tax would exacerbate this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **High Business Costs**: Canada already faces high corporate tax rates, regulations, and labour costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The tax increase adds another burden for companies trying to grow, sell, or reinvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios and Outcomes

The future of the capital gains tax depends on ongoing legal and political developments. Three potential outcomes are:

1.  **Full Reversal (Best Case Scenario)**:
    *   **Judicial Review Success**: Courts could block the CRA from enforcing the higher inclusion rate, effectively reversing the tax hike before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   **New Government**: If Pierre Poilievre wins and fulfills his promise, the inclusion rate would likely revert to 50% for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This would benefit investors, business owners, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

2.  **Partial Rollback or Temporary Freeze (Middle Ground)**:
    *   **Conservative Compromise**: An elected Poilievre government might lower the inclusion rate but not fully restore it to 50%, potentially applying different rules for corporations versus individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   **Liberal Adjustment**: A new Liberal leader, distancing themselves from the tax, might slightly reduce the inclusion rate but not revert it fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

3.  **No Reversal (Worst Case Scenario)**:
    *   **Failed Legal Challenges**: If the courts rule in the government's favour, the CRA would continue collecting at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   **Poilievre Does Not Follow Through**: Even if elected, Poilievre might not reverse the tax due to economic pressures or competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   **Liberals Retain Power**: If the Liberals remain in power, a reversal might be off the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, forcing businesses and investors to adapt to the new tax reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Despite the highly likely scenario of a full reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, investors and business owners should prepare for all possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Given the widespread opposition, legal challenges, political shifts, the deferral to January 1st, 2026, and the Trump tariffs, a full reversal is estimated to have an 80% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, a partial rollback a 5% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, and the tax remaining unchanged a 15% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Recommendations for Investors and Business Owners

To navigate this uncertain period, it's advised for individuals and businesses to:

*   **Stay Informed**: Monitor court rulings, political developments, and election timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Utilize [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | Tax Efficient Investment Strategies]]**: Maximize TFSAs, RRSPs, and corporate structures to reduce [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | taxable capital gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Plan for Multiple Outcomes**: If considering selling a business, real estate, or other assets, evaluate whether to sell now in case the tax hike proceeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

While a full reversal appears highly probable, nothing is guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Strategic planning is crucial to protect wealth, regardless of how the tax situation unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

The [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] provides financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Updates for [[2025_pension_payment_schedules | 2025]] aim to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Payment Schedule

For [[2025_pension_payment_schedules | 2025]], the Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for [[canada_pension_plan_2025_updates | CPP]], [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], and [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means recipients will receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These dates typically fall in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date lands on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Pro Tip for Direct Deposit
For convenience and reliability, it is recommended to set up direct deposit through a My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This ensures timely receipt of funds and is safer than waiting for a mailed check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Cost of Living Adjustments

[[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] payments are reviewed quarterly to align with changes in the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   For the January to March [[2025_pension_payment_schedules | 2025]] period, the maximum monthly [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] payment for a single senior remains at $1,086 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, as there was no CPI increase over the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   However, [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] benefits have grown by 2% over the past year (January 2024 to January [[2025_pension_payment_schedules | 2025]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, helping seniors keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Income Thresholds

Eligibility for [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] is dependent on income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For the first quarter of [[2025_pension_payment_schedules | 2025]], the annual income limit for a single person is $22,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

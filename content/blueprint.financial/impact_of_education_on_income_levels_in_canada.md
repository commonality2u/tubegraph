The level of education attained significantly impacts an individual's median income in Canada, with higher education generally correlating with higher earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Data from 2016 for individuals aged 15 to 64 years illustrates this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Median Income by Education Level (2016)

Individuals with a bachelor's degree or higher demonstrated a median income of $69,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This represents the highest earning category among the education levels discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

For those with a post-secondary diploma, excluding university degrees, the median income was $47,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This figure is approximately 31% lower than the median income for individuals with a bachelor's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

At the lower end of the spectrum, individuals with only a high school diploma or no formal education face a substantial [[income_disparity_and_challenges_in_canada | income gap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. High school graduates had a median income of $35,790 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Individuals with no formal education earned over 60% less than the highest earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

These significant differences underscore the importance of education in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

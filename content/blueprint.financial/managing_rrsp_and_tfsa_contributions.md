Tax season involves more than just filing paperwork; it's about retaining more of your income. However, certain mistakes can lead to significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Common Contribution Mistakes to Avoid

### Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs
Exceeding your contribution limits for Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) or Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

*   **RRSP Overcontributions**
    *   Excess RRSP contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty until the excess amount is withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   A common misconception is that the CRA will notify you of an overcontribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Penalties will accumulate quietly until the mistake is discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   There is a pro tip: you are permitted to exceed your RRSP limit by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties, providing a small buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

*   **TFSA Overcontributions**
    *   TFSA contributions also incur a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   Unlike RRSPs, there is no $2,000 buffer for TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

#### Avoiding Penalties
*   **Track Your Contributions**
    *   These mistakes frequently occur because taxpayers do not carefully track their contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to track your own contributions rather than relying solely on your My CRA account, as it may not be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Act Quickly to Withdraw Excess**
    *   If you realize you have overcontributed, withdrawing the excess as soon as possible can help minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Utilizing Accounts for Income Splitting

[[Using TFSA and RRSP Accounts to Control Taxable Income | Income splitting]] can significantly reduce a household's overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

*   **[[Spousal RRSP contributions in Canada | Spousal RRSP Contributions]]**
    *   [[Spousal RRSP contributions | Spousal RRSP contributions]] allow the higher-earning spouse to contribute to the lower-earning spouse's RRSP, potentially leading to tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **TFSA and FHSA for Income Splitting**
    *   Accounts like the TFSA and First Home Savings Account (FHSA) are excellent for income splitting because they are not subject to income attribution rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This allows spouses or family members to contribute and grow investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Proactive Tax Planning

Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just something done when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many tax-saving strategies, including contributions to a FHSA, need to be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Waiting until April can result in missed deductions and a scramble to organize documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Setting up a tax review before year-end can help optimize your strategy and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

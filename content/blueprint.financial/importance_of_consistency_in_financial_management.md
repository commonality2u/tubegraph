Tracking financial goals significantly increases the likelihood of achieving them. According to a study at Michigan State University, tracking your goals makes you 33% more likely to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This consistent approach can transform how finances are managed and help grow wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Analogy to Weight Loss

The principle of consistently tracking finances is similar to tracking weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania showed that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw notable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For example, those who tracked about 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while participants who tracked 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The key takeaway is that tracking correlates with success towards goals, even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Applying Consistency to Finances

The same principle applies to your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By consistently tracking your net worth monthly or quarterly, you can:
*   Spot trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Make smarter decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Stay on course towards your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

Just like weight loss, it's about consistency, not perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Tracking your net worth is akin to steering a ship with a compass; without it, you wouldn't know if you begin to drift off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Benefits of Consistent Net Worth Tracking

Consistent tracking, for example, using [[using_spreadsheets_for_financial_tracking | spreadsheets for financial tracking]], makes the process easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. While initial setup might take 10 to 20 minutes, monthly updates can take as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Setting a recurring monthly reminder is a great way to stay easily committed to the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Through consistent tracking, a visual dashboard can show:
*   Current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   Shortfall needed to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

Consistent data entry allows for observation of trends, such as:
*   **Net Worth Trend**: Ideally, a gradual increase should be observed throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Identifying Dips**: Dips in net worth can be identified, prompting an investigation into what caused them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For instance, a significant drop in long-term assets like an RSP or LIRA could indicate a need to re-evaluate [[managing_investment_risk_appropriately | investment risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This representation helps in honing in on any financial issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Asset vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Visualizing the breakdown of assets versus liabilities helps understand where your wealth is concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Maintaining an annual balance sheet of your net worth allows for comparison to previous years, offering valuable data over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Updating the spreadsheet monthly is rewarding and keeps individuals engaged with their finances, providing a clear visual overview of their [[financial_strategies_for_wealth_building | net worth goal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Alternative Tools for Tracking Net Worth in Canada

While the custom spreadsheet offers full control and customization for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, other tools available for Canadians tracking their net worth as part of their [[strategies_to_manage_personal_finances_in_canada | personal finances in Canada]] include:
*   **Wealthsimple**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview of net worth. Advanced features require a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Quicken**: Replaced Mint and now requires a paid subscription, offering robust financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app with a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

While these tools offer automation, they come with costs, whereas a spreadsheet is free and puts you in full charge of your tracking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Choosing the method that best suits your goals and budget is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

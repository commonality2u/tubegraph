Canadians often face high tax rates, which can reach over 50% in the highest tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. To help minimize this burden, strategic tax planning focuses on several key areas, including saving taxes on investments, income splitting, maximizing tax deductions and credits, [[Retirement Tax Strategies in Canada | retirement tax strategies]], and [[Advanced tax strategies for Canadian small businesses | self-employed tax planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Saving Taxes on Investments

One of the most impactful ways to save on taxes is through strategic investment in registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### The Power of Registered Accounts

Using registered accounts like the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) can significantly increase wealth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!example] Investment Growth Comparison
> Consider Mark, a 30-year-old with $30,000 to invest, splitting it evenly ($10,000 each) between a TFSA, RRSP, and a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Over 30 years, with a 7% annual return, until age 60, and assuming a 40% working tax rate and 20% retirement tax rate, here's how they compare:
>
> *   **TFSA:** Mark pays 40% tax upfront, leaving $6,000 to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. After 30 years of tax-free growth, his TFSA is worth $45,733, with no tax on withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
> *   **RRSP:** Mark invests the full $10,000 tax-free upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. After 30 years, the account grows to $76,123 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Upon withdrawal, at a 20% tax rate, he receives $60,898 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
> *   **Non-Registered Account:** The full $10,000 is invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Annual taxes on returns reduce growth, leaving $31,385 after 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
>
> **Main Takeaway:** Tax-advantaged accounts like the TFSA and RRSP significantly outperform non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The TFSA provides 45% more, while the RRSP nearly doubles the value thanks to tax-free or tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

For first-time home buyers, the new First Home Savings Account (FHSA) combines the tax benefits of a TFSA and an RRSP, offering powerful wealth-building potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### [[Optimizing investment accounts in Canada | Tax-Efficient Investment Choices for Each Account]]

Knowing what to invest in each account is as important as contributing to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

*   **[[Investment Strategies for TFSA | TFSA]]**:
    *   This is a powerhouse for tax-free compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Avoid US dividend stocks and ETFs, as the 15% [[Foreign withholding taxes on Canadian investments | withholding tax]] reduces returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Stick with Canadian or non-dividend paying international stocks or ETFs instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

*   **RRSP**:
    *   Fantastic for deferring taxes on income-heavy assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   This is the best place for US dividend stocks and ETFs, as there is no withholding tax here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   Remember that withdrawals are taxed as regular income, so plan strategically, especially as [[Retirement Tax Strategies in Canada | retirement]] approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Non-Registered Accounts**:
    *   These accounts are flexible but the least tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   They work best for investments with favorable tax treatment, such as Canadian dividend stocks, which benefit from the dividend tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   Consider non-dividend paying stocks, where growth comes from capital gains instead of taxable dividends, deferring taxes until you sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   Avoid interest-heavy investments like bonds or GICs, as they are fully taxed at your marginal rate, making them less suitable for non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

There are many other tax-advantaged accounts beyond the TFSA and RRSP, such as the RPP (Registered Pension Plan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Income Splitting

Income splitting involves shifting income from a higher-income partner to a lower-income partner to take advantage of lower tax brackets and save thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Strategies for Income Splitting

*   **Utilize the FHSA**: The high-income partner can gift money to the low-income partner, who then contributes to their FHSA, gaining a tax deduction and avoiding taxable investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   > [!example] FHSA Income Splitting
        > Jerry gives $8,000 to Elaine, who contributes it to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Elaine gets a $2,400 tax deduction, and they save $2,532 in total taxes, as investments grow tax-free in the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This strategy offers immediate tax savings, tax-free growth, and flexibility to roll into an RRSP if not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It's most effective if the higher-income partner has already maxed out their registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

*   **Splitting Pension Income**: Shifting pension income to a lower-income spouse helps balance taxable income and reduces household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   Before age 65, only defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs) qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. After age 65, defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs), RIFs, and LIFs also qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Pension Income Splitting
        > Jerry earns $40,000 from his pension, taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. By allocating $20,000 to Elaine, who is taxed at 15%, they reduce household taxes from $12,000 to $9,000, saving $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions**: These allow the higher-income partner to contribute to the lower-income spouse's account, deferring taxes and balancing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Spousal RRSP
        > Jerry contributes $12,000 to Elaine's RRSP, reducing his taxable income by $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. When Elaine withdraws the funds at a 20% tax rate, they save $1,800 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   > [!tip]
        > Avoid early withdrawals within 3 years of contribution to prevent attribution back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

*   **CPP Income Splitting**: Couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can split up to 50% of their benefits, lowering their overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   > [!example] CPP Income Splitting
        > Jerry shifts $3,000 of his CPP income to Elaine, saving $450 in taxes by taking advantage of her lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

*   **Splitting Capital Losses**: Capital losses from one spouse can offset the other's capital gains using superficial loss rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Capital Loss Splitting
        > Jerry has a $4,000 capital loss from selling stock early in the year, which offsets Elaine's $15,000 gain, saving $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   > [!tip]
        > This applies only to non-registered accounts and must comply with CRA rules for timing and holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Maximizing Deductions and Tax Credits

Deductions and tax credits directly reduce your tax bill or taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Common Deductions and Credits

*   **Child Care Expenses**: You can deduct eligible child care expenses to lower taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   For children under 7, you can claim up to $8,000 per child annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   For children aged 7 to 16, up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   For children eligible for the Disability Tax Credit, up to $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

*   **Moving Expenses**: If you relocate at least 40 km closer to a new job or school, you can deduct moving expenses including transportation, storage, and temporary living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Moving Expense Deduction
        > If you have $10,000 in moving expenses and are in a 30% tax bracket, you could save $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

*   **Medical Expenses**: You can claim medical expenses exceeding the lesser of 3% of your net income or a set threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   For 2023, this threshold is $2,635 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Medical Expense Claim
        > If your net income is $60,000, 3% is $1,800, making expenses over this amount eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. If you have $5,000 in medical expenses, you could claim $3,200, resulting in $480 in tax savings with a 15% federal tax credit rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Numerous other tax credits and deductions are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## [[Retirement Tax Strategies in Canada | Saving Taxes in Retirement]]

Effective [[Retirement Tax Strategies in Canada | tax planning in retirement]] involves how you withdraw and manage your funds to minimize overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Effective Retirement Tax Strategies

*   **RIF Withdrawal Strategies**: To minimize taxable income, use your younger spouse's age to calculate RIF minimums, allowing you to withdraw less each year and keeping taxable income lower for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   > [!example] RIF Withdrawal using Spousal Age
        > If Sarah is 70 and her spouse is 65, using her spouse's age for RIF calculations reduces the minimum withdrawal amount, helping Sarah stay in a lower tax bracket and avoid OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Tax Credits for Retirees**:
    *   **Age Amount Credit**: Canadians aged 65 or older can claim an additional $9,28 as a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This credit phases out for incomes exceeding $43,353 and entirely at higher income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   **Pension Income Credit**: Up to $2,000 of eligible pension income can be claimed, offering a federal tax credit of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This applies to RIF withdrawals or employer pensions but not CPP or OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Retiree Tax Credits
        > Margaret, age 67, with a taxable income of $40,000, claims the age amount credit ($8,001) and pension income credit ($2,000), reducing her taxable income by $10,001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

*   **TFSA and RRSP Optimization in Retirement**: Strategic use of these accounts can manage taxable income and preserve government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   **Use TFSA withdrawals to avoid higher tax brackets**: TFSA withdrawals are tax-free, making them an ideal supplement to RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
        *   > [!example] TFSA to Supplement RRSP
            > John withdraws $10,000 from his RRSP and $20,000 from his TFSA to meet his $30,000 income needs, avoiding a higher tax bracket because the TFSA withdrawal is not taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   **Shift excess RRSP withdrawals to your TFSA**: If you retire without a maxed-out TFSA, you can move extra RRSP funds into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This reduces future RIF withdrawals, avoids higher taxes, and provides tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
        *   > [!example] Shifting RRSP to TFSA
            > Sarah withdraws $60,000 from her RRSP and contributes $20,000 to her TFSA to reduce future taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

*   **Using Life Insurance as a Tax-Saving Tool**: Permanent life insurance policies (whole or universal life) offer tax-efficient ways to transfer wealth upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
    *   Policyholders can grow investments within the policy tax-free and leave a tax-free death benefit to beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Life Insurance for Tax-Free Wealth Transfer
        > Sarah uses a whole life policy to grow $100,000 tax-free, which will transfer to her heirs completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This is effective because, upon death, your entire estate is deemed disposed of and taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Shifting some RRSP savings into a life insurance policy can transfer that value to beneficiaries completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
    *   > [!tip]
        > This strategy largely depends on your health, and the best time to get life insurance is while you are still healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

## [[Advanced tax strategies for Canadian small businesses | Tax Strategies for Self-Employed Business Owners]]

Being self-employed offers unique opportunities to save on taxes, applicable even to gig economy workers like Uber drivers or DoorDash deliverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Key Self-Employed Tax Strategies

*   **Claiming Business Expenses**: Many costs associated with running a business are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This includes office supplies, marketing, business travel, professional fees, or a portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Business Expense Deduction
        > If you make $80,000 a year but claim $20,000 in business expenses, your taxable income drops to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. At a 30% tax rate, that's $6,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This is why self-employed income is often considered more valuable than employee income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

*   **Home Office Deductions**: If you work from home, you can claim a percentage of household expenses like rent, utilities, and property taxes, based on the space used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Home Office Deduction
        > If your home office occupies 10% of your home and annual household expenses total $30,000, you can claim $3,000 as a deduction, saving $900 if your tax rate is 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

*   **Hiring a Family Member**: Pay a reasonable salary to a spouse or family member who helps with your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. This shifts income to someone in a lower tax bracket, saving the family money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   > [!example] Hiring Family Member
        > If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 at a 20% tax rate, your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This results in $10,500 in savings for you, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes on their income, for a net family tax savings of $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
    *   > [!info]
        > The salary must be reasonable; the CRA is strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

These [[Tax efficient investment strategies in Canada | tax strategies]] are crucial for protecting and growing your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

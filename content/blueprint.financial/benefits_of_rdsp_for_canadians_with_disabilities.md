The Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) is a long-term savings plan designed to provide significant financial support for Canadians with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It offers substantial government grants and bonds to help build financial security for a loved one with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Key Government Benefits

The RDSP provides two main forms of government support:

### Canada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG)
The CDSG offers matching contributions based on amounts contributed to the RDSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>:
*   Matches 300% on the first $500 contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Matches 200% on the next $1,000 contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Allows individuals to receive up to $3,500 per year in grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Canada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB)
The CDSB provides additional support without requiring any contributions from the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>:
*   Provides up to $1,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Example of Combined Benefits
Consider an example where you contribute $1,500 to an RDSP annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>:
*   You could receive up to $3,500 from the CDSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   You could receive an additional $1,000 from the CDSB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   This results in a total of $4,500 in free government support each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Priority in Financial Planning
The RDSP should be prioritized first among all savings accounts if one qualifies, due to its very generous government grants for disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. These accounts offer a "free money advantage" and should come before other options like the FHSA or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

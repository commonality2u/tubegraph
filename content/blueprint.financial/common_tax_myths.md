One prevalent misconception about the [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]] is the belief that receiving a raise might result in taking home less money due to being pushed into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Myth: A Raise Means Less Take-Home Pay

Some individuals mistakenly believe that if their income crosses a certain threshold, their *entire* income will be taxed at the higher rate of the new bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. For example, an individual earning $56,000 in a 15% federal tax bracket might decline a raise to $60,000, fearing that crossing the $57,375 income mark would bump them into a 20.5% tax bracket and lead to less net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This perspective suggests that the higher tax rate would apply to all earnings, rather than just the portion above the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Understanding the [[canadian_tax_system | Progressive Tax System]]
> Canada operates on a progressive tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of your income are taxed at different rates, depending on the tax bracket they fall into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Reality: How Progressive Taxation Works

Under a progressive tax system:
*   Only the income earned *above* a specific threshold is taxed at the higher bracket's rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   All income below that threshold continues to be taxed at the lower rate applicable to that specific bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

For instance, if your income crosses the $57,375 mark, only the amount *over* $57,375 will be taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The portion of your income up to $57,375 will still be taxed at the original 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

> [!TIP] It's Always Better to Get a Raise
> Because of the progressive nature of the [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]], receiving a raise will always result in taking home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The fear that a raise could lead to less take-home pay is a classic tax myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

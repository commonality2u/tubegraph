To achieve a $1 million TFSA, it's crucial to understand and avoid common pitfalls. Two significant [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_growing_a_tfsa | common mistakes to avoid in growing a TFSA]] involve either being too conservative or taking on excessive risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Investing Only in a Savings Account

One major mistake is investing a TFSA solely in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
Consider a scenario where you start with $95,000, contribute $7,000 annually, and earn a low 2% interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Time to Goal**: It would take 56 years to reach $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. If starting at age 25, you would be 81 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Total Contributions**: You would have contributed a total of $487,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: A recent survey indicates that 47% of Canadian TFSA holders have only cash and savings in their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This approach makes it unlikely for many Canadians to reach a million-dollar goal, even if they max out their TFSAs annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Taking on Excessive Risk

On the opposite end of the spectrum, another [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_a_TFSA | common mistake]] is taking on excessive risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
For instance, a crypto investor taking insane risks and betting on very high-risk crypto coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>:
*   **Hypothetical Outcome**: Starting with $95,000 and achieving 100% returns annually could theoretically reach $1 million in 3 to 4 years, with only $120,000 invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Reality**: This is a terrible strategy for most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. While some might get lucky, the vast majority will not achieve such returns, and the chances of losing all your money are extremely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Analogy**: Investing is like choosing a driving road; a highway might be faster, but driving over the speed limit carries higher risks like accidents or tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Warren Buffett's Principle**: As Warren Buffett famously stated, "Rule number one: Never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This emphasizes avoiding losses over striving for spectacular gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The key to successful TFSA growth is to find a middle ground between being too conservative and taking on too much risk, balancing your potential returns with your risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

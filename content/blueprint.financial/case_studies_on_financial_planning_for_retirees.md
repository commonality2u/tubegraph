Many retirees face a "save or spend dilemma," struggling to shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset when it comes to utilizing their accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This hesitation can lead to missed experiences or even neglecting health care improvements during their golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. While cautious spending offers benefits like promoting thoughtful decisions, making money last longer (reducing [[impact_of_longer_life_expectancy_on_retirement_planning | longevity risk]]), and protecting against market losses (reducing sequence of returns risk), a key challenge for many retirees is simply not knowing how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

A [[benefits_of_comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | well-structured financial plan]] can help overcome this by outlining how much can be spent and stress-testing the investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

Here are two [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | case studies of retirement spending patterns]] illustrating how retirees can find the right balance between saving and spending:

## Michael and Karen: Increasing Spending Confidence

Michael (66) and Karen (64) sought to increase their spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving, but were unsure how much more they could comfortably spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

### Client Profile
*   **Combined Income:** $180,000 annually from pensions (CPP, OAS, work pensions) and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Annual Expenses:** $70,000 covering basic living costs, travel, and discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Savings:** $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **Goal:** Increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### Process
Despite a significant income surplus of $110,000 ($180,000 income - $70,000 expenses), Michael and Karen were hesitant to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Their [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial planning]] assessed their situation and determined that their $4 million portfolio, with a sustainable withdrawal rate of only 3.5%, could provide an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams already covered their basic expenses, meaning their investments were largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Solution
To provide peace of mind, their portfolio was stress-tested for poor market conditions, including a simulated 30% decline in value early in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Even under this scenario, their portfolio remained sustainable long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Longevity projections, assuming they lived to age 95, showed their portfolio would last well beyond their predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

### Outcome
Armed with this information, Michael and Karen felt confident spending more freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. They booked luxury vacations, began home renovations, and increased charitable contributions, enjoying their retirement without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## Robert and Susan: Balancing Lifestyle and Legacy Goals

Robert (70) and Susan (68) aimed to leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Client Profile
*   **Combined Income:** Approximately $100,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   **Annual Expenses:** $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Savings:** $1.2 million in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   **Goal:** Leave a meaningful inheritance while enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

### Process
Robert and Susan were cautious with their spending, unsure if they could afford more travel and leisure while ensuring a sufficient legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Their financial situation review determined that their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover their $75,000 in expenses, allowing for increased spending flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

### Solution
To balance their lifestyle and legacy goals, a recommendation was made to slightly increase their spending from $75,000 to $85,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This allowed for more funds towards travel and experiences while keeping their inheritance goal intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Stress testing their portfolio, including potential market downturns, confirmed they could maintain their spending without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

### Outcome
With the new spending plan, Robert and Susan felt confident in enjoying a higher quality of life while still leaving a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This approach helped them achieve the right balance between enjoying retirement and meeting long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

Clients with larger portfolios often find it harder to spend more money due to deeply ingrained savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. A helpful approach is to ease into spending by setting small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies, which can gradually shift one's mindset and enhance retirement enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

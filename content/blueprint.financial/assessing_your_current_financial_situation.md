## Components of Financial Assessment

To get a comprehensive view, you need to track all your assets, liabilities, and income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This includes:

*   **Savings Accounts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
*   **Registered Accounts**: Such as Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

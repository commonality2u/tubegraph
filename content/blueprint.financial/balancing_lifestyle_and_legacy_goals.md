Retirees often face a dilemma: how much to spend versus how much to save each year from their accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This [[the_save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save or spend dilemma]] is common and requires a mindset shift from scarcity to abundance to confidently use saved funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Finding the right balance between enjoying retirement and preserving wealth for future generations or charitable causes is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be Detrimental

While saving has been a lifelong habit, hesitating to spend in retirement can lead to negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Missed Experiences and Opportunities
Retirees who are reluctant to spend may miss out on significant experiences such as travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enhance their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These are the moments that make retirement fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Healthspan Versus Lifespan
Dr. Peter Attia, in his book "Outlive," distinguishes between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting the enjoyment of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Inflation's Impact
Inflation steadily erodes the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While this is a concern, a [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | well-planned retirement]] should account for inflation to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Benefits of Cautious Spending

Despite the downsides, a hesitation to spend is not entirely negative and can offer certain advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Encourages Thoughtful Spending
Caution promotes deliberate and well-considered spending decisions, rather than impulsive purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Helps Money Last Longer
A careful approach ensures that money stretches further, reducing the [[the_save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | longevity risk]] of running out of funds prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Reduces Portfolio Risk
Cautious spending helps protect against [[the_save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | sequence of returns risk]], where market losses early in retirement can quickly deplete a portfolio, even if markets later recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Aligns with Legacy Goals
For many, a significant priority is leaving a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Being cautious with spending allows retirees to achieve these legacy goals while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The core challenge for many retirees is not knowing how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Due to the complexity of variables and factors, it's natural to err on the side of caution to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, this cautious approach can prevent them from enjoying the wealth they worked hard to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. It is often possible to achieve all [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | financial goals]] and still spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

A [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | well-structured financial plan]] is essential to clearly outline safe spending limits and to stress test the investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This process helps retirees transition from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Case Study: Michael and Karen – Increased Lifestyle Spending
Michael (66) and Karen (64) had a combined annual income of $180,000 (from pensions like CPP, OAS, and work pensions, plus investments) and yearly expenses of $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. They had $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Despite a $110,000 surplus, they were hesitant to increase their spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

With a sustainable withdrawal rate of 3.5% from their $4 million portfolio, they could safely withdraw an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams already covered basic expenses, leaving their investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

A financial plan stress-tested their portfolio for poor market conditions, modeling a 30% decline in value in early years, and it remained safe for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Longevity projections assuming they lived to age 95 showed their portfolio would last well beyond their predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Armed with this information, Michael and Karen gained confidence to book luxury vacations, begin home renovations, and increase charitable contributions, enjoying retirement without jeopardizing their [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | financial future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Case Study: Robert and Susan – Balancing Lifestyle and Legacy
Robert (70) and Susan (68) had a combined annual income of $100,000 and expenses of $75,000, with $1.2 million in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Their goal was to leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They were cautious about increasing spending due to their legacy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Analysis revealed their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover expenses and increase spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

To balance their lifestyle and legacy goals, a slight increase in spending from $75,000 to $85,000 per year was recommended, allowing for more travel and experiences while maintaining the inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Stress testing confirmed that their portfolio could comfortably maintain this spending even in adverse market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

This plan allowed Robert and Susan to enjoy a higher quality of life while still ensuring a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Pro Tip for Retirees with Large Portfolios
The larger a client's portfolio, the harder it often is to convince them to spend more, primarily due to ingrained strict savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. If you have built a large portfolio, consider easing into spending by setting small, meaningful [[defining_retirement_goals | goals]] like minor trips or new hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Gradually shifting your mindset can help you enjoy your retirement more fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Don't let fear prevent you from enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

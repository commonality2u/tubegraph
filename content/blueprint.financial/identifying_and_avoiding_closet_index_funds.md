Many investors choose mutual funds, believing them to be a smart and safe investment option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, hidden issues like convoluted fees, complicated reporting, and industry jargon can quietly erode wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. One significant concern is the practice of "closet indexing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## What is a Closet Indexer?

A closet indexer is a mutual fund that markets itself as actively managed but, in reality, closely tracks a benchmark index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Investors pay high fees for what they believe is expert decision-making, but they are essentially paying more for the same returns they could get from a low-cost Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

It's like paying for a five-star chef at a Michelin restaurant but receiving a frozen TV dinner instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Key Signs of a Closet Indexer

### 1. Underperformance Relative to Fees
A significant red flag is when a fund underperforms its benchmark despite claiming active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Example: TD Canadian Equity Fund**
    This $7.4 billion fund is marketed as actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. However, its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX composite index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   **Underperformance:** Over 10 years, this fund returned 6.87% annually, while its index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   **Excessive Fees:** It charges a Management Expense Ratio (MER) of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, significantly higher than a low-cost Canadian index ETF (like XIC) at 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   **Financial Impact:** An investor with $100,000 in this fund for 10 years would have missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains due to trailing the index by 1.72% per year, all while paying steep management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### 2. Low Active Share and Turnover Rate
A low active share means the fund's holdings do not deviate significantly from its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   The TD Canadian Equity Fund, for example, has a low turnover rate of 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, indicating it's not making many "bold investment decisions" or frequent trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. A turnover rate under 20% suggests minimal active trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### 3. Long-Term Returns Mirroring an Index
If a fund's performance consistently moves in lockstep with an index but charges higher fees, it's very likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Prevalence in Canada

Canada has a notable issue with closet indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>:
*   Approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds are invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   A Morningstar study found that many actively managed Canadian mutual funds have low active share scores, meaning they barely deviate from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## How to Identify a Closet Indexer

Since closet indexers won't admit their true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, here's how to spot them:
*   **Compare Holdings:** Compare the fund's holdings to a benchmark ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. If stock allocations are nearly identical, you're paying high fees for no added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Analyze Long-Term Returns:** Look for performance that closely matches an index over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Check Turnover Rate:** A low turnover rate (under 20%) suggests the fund isn't actively trading or making significant decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Consider Tracking Error:** If a fund's returns closely match the index year-over-year, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Avoiding Closet Index Funds

If you hold a high-fee, underperforming mutual fund, it's crucial to explore better alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. A [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | common investor mistake]] is to focus only on positive returns, rather than comparing them to benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Here are more transparent and potentially lower-fee investment options:

### 1. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
ETFs typically have much lower Management Expense Ratios (MERs), starting around 0.05% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. They also offer better [[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds_and_alternatives | tax efficiency]] and often outperform mutual funds due to their low-fee, long-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

### 2. Robo-Advisors
These automated investment platforms (like Wealthsimple) provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost of traditional mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

### 3. DIY Stock Investing
For investors comfortable managing their own portfolios, direct investment in individual stocks and ETFs can be a much lower-cost alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

### 4. Professional Portfolio Managers
For those seeking active management, working with professional portfolio managers can offer customized strategies with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% (depending on portfolio size), often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### 5. Switching Mutual Fund Series
If you currently hold a mutual fund, inquire about switching from a Series A fund (which often includes hidden advisor fees) to a Series F fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Series F funds are lower-cost versions without embedded advisor commissions and are typically accessible through discount brokerages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Ultimately, your financial future should take precedence over loyalty to a bank or advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. It's essential to seek a transparent strategy that actively helps build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

In Canada, [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] are a significant investment vehicle, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024, compared to $429 billion in [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite their popularity, there are many hidden downsides, particularly concerning how their performance is often presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. One major issue is the impact of survivorship bias.

## What is Survivorship Bias?

Survivorship bias occurs when only the surviving funds are considered in performance reports, while poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. This practice creates a misleadingly positive picture of the [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## How it Misleads Investors

Banks and financial institutions often highlight only the success stories among [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]], showcasing top-performing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. This selective reporting ignores the [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_mutual_funds_in_canada | underperforming funds]] that were closed or merged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. This creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

For example, advertisements may feature impressive returns from high performers, conveniently omitting the many other funds that [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_mutual_funds_in_canada | underperformed]] and were quietly closed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. This marketing tactic leads investors to believe in an overall high performance that doesn't reflect the full reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### An Illustrative Analogy

Imagine watching a movie trailer that only includes the most exciting, well-made scenes, but the rest of the movie is poorly executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Viewers are misled into thinking the entire movie is great, when in reality, it's mostly terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Similarly, banks focus on top-performing funds, giving an illusion of consistent high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

Another analogy is if 39% of restaurants in a city closed down because they were bad, but only the top ones remained and advertised their success stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. You might think the dining scene was thriving, but you'd be missing a huge part of the picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

## Statistical Evidence of Survivorship Bias in Canada

Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. On average across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

Specifically:
*   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   For Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

This means that a significant portion of [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] do not survive, yet their failure is excluded from performance reports, leading to an inflated perception of industry success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Aggressive Distribution Channels and Marketing

The aggressive distribution channels of [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] contribute to their popularity despite these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. They are incredibly easy to access and convenient, offering a straightforward way to diversify without extensive market knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Banks and financial advisors actively push these high-profit products, leading many Canadians to invest in them over more cost-effective options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

Investors are also drawn to [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] because they are managed by professional portfolio managers, who are seen as experts capable of making informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. This marketing, combined with the trust in large financial institutions, convinces many to choose [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

Even marketing like Morningstar's five-star ratings can mislead investors into believing they will achieve better performance, despite studies showing these funds often [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_mutual_funds_in_canada | underperform]] in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

Understanding survivorship bias is crucial for investors to make informed decisions and avoid the misleading portrayal of [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual fund]] performance.

When [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | relocating]] from Canada, it is crucial to understand how tax treaties affect your [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | tax residency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Some countries have tax treaties with Canada that include "tiebreaker rules" to determine residency when both countries can claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected and negative tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Deemed Non-Resident Status

An individual is considered a [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | deemed non-resident]] when they qualify as a [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax resident]] in another country with a tax treaty, meaning Canada will not tax them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. While many people confuse the difference between a [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | non-resident]] and a [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | deemed non-resident]], the key distinction lies in how [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency]] is determined and whether a tax treaty applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. However, both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## How Tax Treaties Determine Residency

If your new country has a tax treaty with Canada, the following criteria are typically used to resolve [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | dual residency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:

1.  **Permanent Home** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>: Where do you have a permanent place of residence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> If you have a permanent home in both countries, the next criterion is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
2.  **Center of Vital Interests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>: Where are your personal and economic ties strongest? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> This includes factors like family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
3.  **Habitual Abode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>: In which country do you habitually reside? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
4.  **Physical Presence (183-Day Rule)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>: Some countries automatically consider an individual a [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax resident]] if they spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Example: Moving to the US

The US employs a substantial presence test to determine [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If you spend 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year, you could be considered a US [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax resident]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

However, under the Canada-US tax treaty, tiebreaker rules can resolve [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | dual residency]] situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Even if you meet a substantial presence test in the US, if your permanent residence and center of vital interests are still in Canada, you may be deemed a Canadian [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | resident]] for [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | tax purposes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

#### Case Study: Tiffany's Job Assignment in New York

Tiffany, a Canadian citizen, accepts a one-year job assignment in New York starting in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She owns a condo in Toronto where her spouse and children continue to live, and she maintains her Canadian bank accounts and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

During the year, Tiffany spends more than 183 days in the US, qualifying her as a US [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax resident]] under the IRS substantial presence test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This test considers individuals physically present in the US for at least 31 days during the current year and a total of 183 days over the current and preceding two years, using a specific calculation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Despite meeting this test, the Canada-US tax treaty provides tiebreaker rules to resolve [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | dual residency]] situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. These rules assess factors such as:

*   **Permanent Home** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>: Tiffany owns a home in Canada but rents an apartment in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Center of Vital Interests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>: Her family and financial ties remain in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Habitual Abode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>: Since Tiffany intends to return to Canada after one year, her long-term residency remains Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Citizenship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>: If there is still uncertainty, her Canadian citizenship favors Canada as her [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

**Outcome**: Canada remains Tiffany's primary [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency]] under the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The US may still tax her US income, but she can avoid being fully taxed as a US [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | resident]] on her worldwide income (e.g., investments or rental properties in Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Impact on Canadian-Sourced Income for Non-Residents

Even after departing Canada, certain Canadian-sourced incomes could remain taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | Tax treaty]] considerations can reduce withholding tax rates for [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | non-residents]].

Withholding [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | tax rates]] vary by country under Canada's tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions ([[oas_eligibility_and_taxes_when_retiring_overseas | OAS]]), dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Before filing Form NR5 or electing under Section 216 for rental income, check if your new country has a tax treaty with Canada that automatically lowers your withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, you will likely have lower CPP, [[oas_eligibility_and_taxes_when_retiring_overseas | OAS]], and RSP withholding tax rates than the standard 25% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is extremely complex to navigate tax law when two tax systems are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Without proper planning, you could end up paying thousands more than necessary or even face double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

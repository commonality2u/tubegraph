For small business owners in Canada, moving beyond [[simple_tax_deductions_for_canadian_small_businesses | simple deductions]] can lead to significant savings. These intermediate-level tax write-offs require a bit more involvement and understanding of specific rules, but the benefits can be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Deducting Salaries Paid to Family Members
You can deduct salaries paid to family members, provided the salary is reasonable and reflects the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. To avoid issues with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), it's crucial to treat the employment of family members like any other employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This strategy not only helps manage your business effectively but also keeps funds within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

*   **Example**: If you hire your son to manage social media accounts at $20 an hour for 20 hours a week, this totals 1,040 hours a year, amounting to $20,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This entire amount is a deductible business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For a business with $100,000 in taxable income, deducting this salary would reduce the taxable income to $79,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Equipment Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance - CCA)
When purchasing assets like computers, machinery, or furniture for your business, you cannot deduct the full cost in the year of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Instead, you depreciate the cost over several years, a process known as Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The CRA has specific classes for different types of assets, each with its own rate of depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

*   **Examples of CCA Classes**:
    *   Computers fall under Class 50, with a 55% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
    *   Furniture falls under Class 8, with a 20% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Calculating CCA**: Applying the correct class and rate is vital for accurate deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   For example, if you purchase a computer for $2,000 (Class 50, 55% rate), you can claim 55% of $2,000, which is $1,100, in the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The remaining balance can be depreciated in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Interest on Business Loans
Interest payments on loans taken out to finance business operations are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This applies to various types of loans, including lines of credit, term loans, and even certain credit card interest, provided the expenses are business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It is important to separate business loan interest from personal loan interest, as only the interest on loans used specifically for business purposes can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

*   **Example**: Interest paid on a loan used to purchase new equipment for your business is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Commercial Insurance Premiums
Premiums paid for insurance on your business assets, such as property, equipment, and inventory, are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This includes policies that cover losses from fire, theft, and other damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

*   **Example**: If you insure your office building and equipment, the premiums paid can be deducted from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

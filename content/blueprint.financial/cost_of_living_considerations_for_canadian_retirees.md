Many Canadians initially believe that their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits will be sufficient for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, for those who rely heavily on these benefits, it's often a challenging experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Retirement income from CPP and OAS alone can result in a barebones lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Average Combined Income from CPP, OAS, and GIS

For retirees with no other income sources, the total estimated monthly income could be around $2,000, combining average CPP ($800), OAS ($700), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) ($500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This amount is barely above the poverty line, making it a difficult basis for a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Breakdown of Retiree Expenses in Canada

Living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada is technically possible but requires significant sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Here's a look at how expenses add up:

*   **Housing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
    *   **Owned Home:** If a home is owned outright, costs are lower, but property taxes, maintenance, and utilities can still amount to $500 or more per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Renting:** In smaller cities, rent can be a minimum of $1,000 per month, consuming over half of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. In major cities like Toronto or Vancouver, one-bedroom rents easily exceed $2,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>
    *   With rising prices, a basic grocery budget for a single senior is about $300 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Eating out frequently is not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
    *   For those under 65 without provincial plan coverage, private insurance may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be substantial expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
    *   Includes electricity, heating, internet, and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   Car ownership (insurance, gas, maintenance) can add $200 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Public transit typically costs at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Limitations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
    *   There's generally no budget for travel or major purchases like furniture, appliances, or a new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
    *   Living month-to-month means unexpected bills can cause financial instability, potentially requiring reliance on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Scenarios Where Living on CPP and OAS Might Work

While challenging, relying on CPP and OAS alone can be possible under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:

*   **Owning Your Home Outright:** Eliminating mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners may also be able to borrow against their home or downsize for extra capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Living in a Very Low-Cost Area:** Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs:** Living with roommates, family, or housemates can significantly stretch a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Having Extra Support:** Assistance from family, additional investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree living in a small town in Ontario with minimal expenses could potentially manage on $2,000 per month with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## When Relying on CPP and OAS Falls Apart

For most retirees, living solely on CPP and OAS is insufficient due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>:

*   **Major City Costs of Living:** High expenses in major cities make it very difficult to survive on this income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses:** Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **No Savings:** Without an emergency fund, every month becomes a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement constantly worrying about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_of_retirement_in_canada | challenges of retirement in Canada]] without additional income.

## Strategies to Bridge the Income Gap and Reduce Costs

If CPP and OAS benefits are not enough, there are several strategies to consider:

*   **Delay CPP and OAS:** Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP grows by 42% and OAS by 36% by delaying to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Part-time Work:** Picking up part-time work or delaying full retirement can ensure money lasts longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs:**
    *   **Downsizing:** Frees up capital for homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **Relocating:** Moving to a [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | lower-cost area in Canada]] or [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | abroad]] can make money go farther <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Utilize Government Benefits:** Programs like the Allowance for the Survivor can provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning:** Income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can [[tax_saving_tips_for_canadian_retirees | lower tax burden]] and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Creative Approaches to Manage Costs

Some retirees are thinking outside the box to make limited incomes work:

*   **House Hacking:** Renting out part of a home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or house-sitting to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Hobbies into Income:** Monetizing skills like teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming a part-time tour guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements:** Programs like TrustedHousesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement:** Slow travel through low-cost countries, taking advantage of extended tourist visas to live for months where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Many active retirees in their 60s or early 70s embrace this lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. One retiree in Mexico lived on around $1,500 a month, with $600 for rent and daily meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Early retirement planning is crucial; the sooner a potential shortfall is identified, the more options are available to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

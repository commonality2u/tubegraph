The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) incorporates an annual cost of living adjustment to help beneficiaries maintain their purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. These adjustments are designed to align CPP payments with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, reflecting [[cpp_and_inflation_considerations | inflation considerations]] and aiming to mitigate the [[impact_of_inflation_on_cpp_beneficiaries | impact of inflation on CPP beneficiaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## 2025 Cost of Living Adjustment

For 2025, the [[cpp_cost_of_living_increase_in_2025 | CPP cost of living increase]] is set at 2.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Example Calculation
If a beneficiary was receiving $1,000 per month in CPP payments in 2024, the 2.6% adjustment for 2025 would add $26 to their monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This results in a new monthly payment of $1,026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This adjustment helps retirees maintain their purchasing power as costs rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. However, for 2025, this increase is considered relatively small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) serves as a vital tool in reducing child poverty and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This tax-free payment helps families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, contributing significantly to easing the financial burden associated with raising children.

## Direct Impact on Poverty Reduction

Since its launch, the CCB has had a substantial impact:
*   In 2021 alone, the CCB helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   It supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Financial Relief for Lower-Income Families

The average [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising a child in Canada]] from birth to age 17 is estimated at $293,000, or about $17,235 per year for a two-parent middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For lower-income families, the CCB offers substantial financial support:
*   Families earning less than $83,000 annually spend about 52% less than higher-income families, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB can cover over 50% of the entire [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising their child]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Families earning $35,000 or less receive the full benefit, which is $7,777 per year or $649 per month for a child under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The [[canada_child_benefit_breakdown | Canada Child Benefit]] is designed to act as an umbrella, shielding families from the impact of rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Broader Socioeconomic Goals

Beyond immediate poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Its design as a tax-free payment indexed to inflation ensures that the support keeps pace with rising costs, further enhancing its effectiveness over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

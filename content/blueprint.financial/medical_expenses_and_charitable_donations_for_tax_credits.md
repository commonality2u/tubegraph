As the year approaches its end, reviewing medical expenses and charitable donations can significantly reduce your tax bill through available credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:05">[06:35:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Medical Expenses

In Canada, you can claim a [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | medical expense tax credit]] for [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:09">[06:38:09]</a>.

### Eligibility and Threshold
The tax credit applies to costs exceeding the lesser of 3% of your net income or $2,759 for the 2024 tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:35">[06:41:35]</a>. This means greater incurred expenses can lead to higher potential savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.

For instance, if your net income is $50,000, 3% of that is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:02">[06:54:02]</a>. Since $1,500 is less than the $2,759 threshold, you can claim expenses that exceed $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:08">[07:04:08]</a>. If you spend $4,000 on [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible medical expenses]], you can claim the difference, which is $2,500 ($4,000 - $1,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
[[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | Eligible medical expenses]] include:
*   Prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>
*   Dental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>
*   Vision care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>
*   Mobility aids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>

> [!NOTE] Pro Tip
> If you are nearing the eligible threshold, consider scheduling additional treatments or purchasing necessary medical items before December 31st to maximize your claim for the current tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:16">[07:29:16]</a>. For example, getting dental work done or buying medical equipment now can increase your claimable expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

## Charitable Donations

Donating to registered charities by December 31st can reduce your tax bill through the charitable donation tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

### Federal and Provincial Credits
*   **Federal Credit**: 15% on the first $200 donated and 29% on amounts over $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Provincial Credits**: Vary by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:21">[08:01:21]</a>. For example, Alberta offers a 60% donation tax credit on the first $200 donated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

As an example, if you donate $100 in Alberta, you would receive the 15% federal tax credit plus the 60% provincial tax credit, resulting in a $75 tax credit on that $100 donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

### Key Tips for Donations
*   **Donation Limit**: You can claim donations up to 75% of your net income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Carry Forward**: Unused donations can be carried forward for up to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Pooling**: Spouses or partners can combine their donations to achieve maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

Retirees often face the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_in_retirement | save or spend dilemma]], hesitating to spend what they've saved despite years of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This hesitation can lead to missed experiences and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. One crucial aspect of this dilemma involves the distinction between healthspan and lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Understanding Healthspan and Lifespan

Dr. Peter Attia, in his book *Outlive*, highlights the critical difference between lifespan and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Lifespan** refers to the total number of years an individual lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Healthspan** is defined as the number of years lived in good health, characterized by being active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Cost of Delayed Spending

Delaying spending in retirement can mean missing out on the best years of one's healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Retirees might wait until their physical abilities decline, which can limit their enjoyment of the wealth they've worked hard to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This can result in missed meaningful experiences such as travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enhance their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

While caution in spending offers benefits like promoting thoughtful decisions, ensuring money lasts longer (reducing longevity risk), and protecting against market losses (reducing sequence of returns risk), it's vital to find a balance to maximize the years lived in good health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Many retirees do not know how much they can safely spend, leading them to err on the side of caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. A well-structured financial plan can help retirees gain the confidence to enjoy their wealth during their peak healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

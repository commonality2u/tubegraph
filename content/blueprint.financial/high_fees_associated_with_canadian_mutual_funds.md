Mutual funds are a significant part of the investment landscape in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024. This contrasts sharply with the $429 billion in [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)]], making mutual funds nearly five times more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, there are many hidden downsides to these investment vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## What Are Mutual Funds?
The discussion primarily refers to high-cost, actively managed mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from numerous investors to acquire a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. They are typically overseen by professional portfolio managers who make strategic decisions to try and outperform a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian mutual funds often fall short of this objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Problem: High Fees
[[high_fees_in_tfsa_investments | Mutual fund fees in Canada]] are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Average Management Expense Ratios (MERs)
According to Morningstar's 2022 report, the average asset-weighted MERs are:
*   **Equity funds**: Approximately 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   **Allocation funds**: About 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **Fixed income funds**: 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

Many equity fund MERs, particularly those from Canada's big five banks, exceed 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Impact of Fees on Returns
A seemingly small 2% management fee can have a massive impact on investment returns over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Consider an investment of $100,000 with an average annual return of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
*   **Without fees**: Over 20 years, the investment would grow to approximately $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **With a 2% fee**: The actual return is 5% after fees. Over the same 20 years, the investment grows to only $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This represents a difference of $122,000, nearly a third of potential returns wiped out by fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The impact becomes even more dramatic over 30 years:
*   **Without fees**: $100,000 grows to $761,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **With a 2% fee**: It grows to just $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is a staggering difference of $329,000, or 43% of potential returns lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This demonstrates that a 2% fee does not just reduce returns by 2%; it significantly diminishes potential gains due to the power of compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Recent Changes
[[the_impact_of_mutual_fund_fees_on_returns | Mutual fund fees in Canada]] have decreased slightly in recent years due to the introduction of fee-based advice and regulatory changes like the Client Focus Reforms, pushing the industry towards greater transparency and slightly lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## The Problem: Low Returns
A significant percentage of [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_mutual_funds_in_canada | actively managed mutual funds in Canada]] underperform their benchmarks over various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark, the S&P/TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   The S&P/TSX Composite Index gained an annualized return of 7.62% over those 10 years, while Canadian Equity Funds only managed 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   The difference between the benchmark's return and the funds' return (approximately 2%) almost exactly matches the fees charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This underperformance extends across various fund categories:
*   Canadian-focused Equity Funds: 98% underperformed over the same 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds: 88.6% fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Canadian Small to Mid-Cap Equity Funds: 76.19% underperformed their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This consistent underperformance highlights a systemic issue within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Tricky Marketing Tactics (Survivorship Bias)
Banks and financial institutions often highlight only the success stories among mutual funds, showcasing top-performing funds while ignoring underperforming funds that were closed or merged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

This marketing tactic utilizes **survivorship bias**, where only surviving funds are considered in performance reports, misleadingly painting a positive picture of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Over a recent 10-year period:
*   43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   On average across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   For Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Tax Inefficiency Concerns
[[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds_and_alternatives | Tax inefficiency]] is often overlooked with mutual funds in Canada and can significantly impact returns, especially in non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Capital Gains Distribution**: Mutual funds must distribute any realized capital gains to investors annually. This means investors may pay taxes on gains even if they haven't sold any shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed mutual funds often engage in frequent trading, generating numerous short-term capital gains, which are taxed at a higher rate (regular income tax rate) than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing**: Investors are subject to the fund manager's decisions on when to realize gains or losses, potentially leading to taxable events at inopportune times and increasing tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

To avoid these tax inefficiencies, investing in a [[high_fees_in_tfsa_investments | TFSA]] (Tax-Free Savings Account) is an option, as it offers tax-free growth and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Why Are Mutual Funds So Popular? (Aggressive Distribution Channels)
Despite their downsides, mutual funds remain popular due to aggressive distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>:
*   **Accessibility and Convenience**: They offer a straightforward way to diversify without extensive market knowledge or large capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Bank Push**: Banks and financial advisors often aggressively push mutual funds due to high sales targets, as they are high-profit products for the banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Perceived Professional Management**: Many investors are drawn to mutual funds because they are managed by professional portfolio managers, who are seen as experts who can make informed investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Misleading Marketing**: Marketing, such as Morningstar's 5-star ratings, can mislead investors into believing they will achieve better performance, despite studies showing these funds often underperform in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Viable Alternatives to Mutual Funds in Canada
Alternatives to mutual funds offer greater flexibility, lower fees, and better tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>:

1.  **Robo-Advisors**: Offer convenient and cost-effective investing with lower fees (about half of mutual funds). Examples include Questwealth and Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
2.  **Hiring a Portfolio Manager**: Can be more cost-effective than mutual funds, providing personalized investment strategies and professional management at typically lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
3.  **Building Your Own ETF Portfolios**: The tide is turning towards ETFs, with net sales of $4.4 billion in May 2024, compared to $1.8 billion in net redemptions for mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | ETFs]] offer lower fees and better tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
4.  **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Stock Portfolio**: The most hands-on and potentially rewarding option, allowing direct control over investments, minimal fees, and tailored portfolios, but requires significant knowledge, research, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

High fees and underperformance, coupled with [[segregated_fund_fees_in_the_canadian_investment_industry | tricky marketing]] and [[tax_inefficiency_and_distribution_issues_with_mutual_funds | tax inefficiencies]], highlight why mutual funds may not be the best choice for Canadian investors, especially when considering their impact on long-term wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Mutual funds are a significant part of the Canadian investment landscape, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While popular, a former financial advisor at a big five Canadian bank highlighted the many hidden downsides of these funds, particularly the high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Defining High-Cost Mutual Funds
When discussing mutual funds, the focus is specifically on the high-cost, actively managed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from multiple investors to acquire a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Professional portfolio managers or teams oversee these funds, making strategic buying and selling decisions with the aim of outperforming a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian mutual funds often [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | fall short]] of this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Exorbitant Fees in Canada
One of the primary reasons mutual funds are considered a "rip-off" in Canada is their high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Canadian mutual fund fees remain among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

According to Morningstar's 2022 report:
*   The average asset-weighted management expense ratio (MER) for equity funds in Canada is around 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   For allocation funds, it's approximately 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   For fixed-income funds, it's 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Some equity funds, like those offered by TD Bank, show MERs exceeding 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. All of Canada's big five banks have similar pricing structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## The Massive Impact of Fees on Returns
While a 2% management fee might seem small, its impact on investment returns over the long term is substantial due to the power of compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Consider an example of investing $100,000 with an average annual return of 7%:
*   **Without Fees**: The investment would grow to approximately $387,000 over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **With a 2% Fee**: The actual return after fees would be 5%. Over the same 20 years, the investment grows to only $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This represents a difference of $122,000, or nearly a third of the potential returns, wiped out by fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The impact becomes even more dramatic over 30 years:
*   **Without Fees**: The $100,000 grows to $761,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **With a 2% Fee**: It grows to just $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is a staggering difference of $329,000, or 43% of potential returns, lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This demonstrates that a 2% fee doesn't just reduce returns by 2%; it significantly diminishes potential gains over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Fees and Underperformance
A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada consistently [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform]] their benchmarks across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformed]] the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The benchmark gained an annualized return of 7.62%, while Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This difference is almost exactly the 2% charged in fees, suggesting that active managers often perform at the average *before* fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Analogy: Fancy Restaurant with Bad Food
> Investing in high-fee mutual funds is comparable to going to an expensive restaurant expecting a gourmet meal, only to receive bland, poorly prepared food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. You pay a premium for an experience that is worse than a cheaper alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Many investors pay a premium for mutual funds expecting higher returns but often receive subpar performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Slight Decrease in Fees
While fees remain high, mutual fund fees in Canada have seen a slight decrease in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This shift is attributed to the introduction of fee-based advice and regulatory changes like the client-focused reforms, which have pushed the industry towards greater transparency and slightly lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
High fees and consistent [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] make mutual funds a costly option for many Canadian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Given these issues, exploring [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | smarter alternatives]] is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

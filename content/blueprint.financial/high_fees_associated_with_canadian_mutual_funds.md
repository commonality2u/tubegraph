[[the_popularity_of_mutual_funds_in_canada | Mutual funds]] are a significant investment vehicle in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024. This contrasts sharply with $429 billion invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating that mutual funds are still almost five times as popular as ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, many of these funds are actively managed and come with high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These high fees are a primary reason why mutual funds can be a disadvantageous investment choice in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Overview of Canadian Mutual Fund Fees

Mutual fund fees in Canada are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. According to Morningstar's 2022 report:
*   The average asset-weighted Management Expense Ratio (MER) for equity funds in Canada is around 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   For allocation funds, it's about 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   For fixed income funds, it's 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Many equity fund MERs, particularly at major financial institutions like TD Bank and other big five banks, can exceed 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Impact of High Fees on Investment Returns

While a 2% management fee might seem small, it can have a massive impact on investment returns over the long term due to the power of compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The "Kim" Example
Consider an investor, Kim, who puts $100,000 into a mutual fund that achieves an average annual return of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
*   **Without fees**: Her investment would grow to approximately $387,000 over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **With a 2% annual fee**: Kim's actual return is reduced to 5% after fees. Over the same 20 years, her investment would only grow to $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This represents a difference of $122,000, or nearly a third of her potential returns, wiped out by fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Over 30 years, the impact becomes even more dramatic:
*   **Without fees**: Kim's $100,000 would grow to $761,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **With a 2% annual fee**: It would only grow to $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is a staggering difference of $329,000, or 43% of her potential returns, lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

This demonstrates that a 2% fee doesn't just reduce returns by 2%; it effectively takes away a large chunk of potential gains due to the compounding effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## High Fees and Low Returns: A Systemic Issue

A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada consistently underperform their respective benchmarks across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark, the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The index gained an annualized return of 7.62%, while Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

The difference between the benchmark's return and the mutual funds' return (approximately 2%) is almost exactly the 2% in fees charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This suggests that active managers often perform at the market average *before* fees, leading to consistent underperformance once fees are factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This underperformance extends across various fund categories:
*   Canadian-focused Equity Funds: 98% underperformed their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds: 88.6% fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Canadian Small to Mid-Cap Equity Funds: 76.19% underperformed their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This consistent underperformance across different fund categories highlights a systemic issue within the mutual fund industry in Canada, where investors pay high fees for lower overall returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It's akin to "going to a fancy restaurant with bad food" â€“ paying a premium for a subpar experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Recent Trends in Fees

While historically high, mutual fund fees in Canada have decreased slightly over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This trend is partly due to the introduction of fee-based advice and regulatory changes like the Client Focus Reforms, which have pushed the industry towards greater transparency and slightly lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Alternatives to High-Fee Mutual Funds

To avoid the impact of high fees, investors can consider several alternatives:
*   **Robo-advisors**: Offer a convenient and cost-effective way to invest, typically charging fees about half of what traditional mutual funds charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Portfolio managers**: Can offer personalized investment strategies often at lower fees than mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Building your own ETF portfolios**: Provides greater flexibility, lower fees, and better tax efficiency compared to mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Do-it-yourself stock portfolios**: The most hands-on approach, allowing direct control, minimal fees, and portfolio tailoring, though it requires significant knowledge and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Investors can also use [[types_of_investment_accounts_in_canada | tax-sheltered accounts]] like the TFSA to help mitigate the impact of taxes on investments, regardless of the investment vehicle chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

[[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | Mutual funds]] are a significant investment vehicle in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024, nearly five times the amount in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, these funds, particularly the high-cost, actively managed ones, come with [[hidden_investment_fees_in_canada | hidden downsides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## What Are These Mutual Funds?
When discussing [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]], the focus is on high-cost, actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from multiple investors to create a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Professional portfolio managers oversee these funds, making strategic decisions to try and outperform a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] frequently fail to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## High Fees in Canada
One of the primary reasons [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] are considered a "rip-off" in Canada is their high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Canadian [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual fund]] fees remain among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   The average asset-weighted management expense ratio (MER) for equity funds in Canada is approximately 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   For allocation funds, it's about 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Fixed-income funds have an MER of 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
These figures are based on Morningstar's 2022 report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Many equity funds from major Canadian banks, such as TD Bank, show MERs exceeding 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. All of Canada's "big five banks" have similar pricing for their [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## [[impact_of_high_fees_on_investment_returns | Impact of High Fees on Investment Returns]]
A seemingly small 2% management fee can have a significant [[impact_of_high_fees_on_investment_returns | impact on investment returns]] over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Consider an example:
*   **Kim's Investment**: Kim invests $100,000 in a [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual fund]] with an average annual return of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Without Fees**: Her investment would grow to approximately $387,000 over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **With a 2% Fee**: Her actual return becomes 5% (7% - 2% fee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Over the same 20 years, her investment grows to just $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This represents a difference of $122,000, or nearly a third of her potential returns, wiped out by fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The [[impact_of_high_fees_on_investment_returns | effect of fees]] becomes even more dramatic over 30 years:
*   **Without Fees**: Kim's $100,000 would grow to $761,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **With a 2% Fee**: It would grow to only $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
This is a staggering difference of $329,000, or 43% of her potential returns, lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This demonstrates that a 2% fee effectively takes away a large chunk of potential gains due to the power of compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Connection to [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | Underperformance]]
High fees are closely linked to the [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | low returns]] observed in actively managed Canadian [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
For instance, over a recent 10-year period:
*   96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | underperformed]] their benchmark, the S&P/TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   The S&P/TSX Composite Index gained an annualized return of 7.62% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Canadian Equity Funds, on an equal-weighted basis, managed only 5.64% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
The difference between the index return and the fund return (7.62% - 5.64% = 1.98%) is almost exactly the 2% fee charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, suggesting that after fees, active managers largely perform around the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Tax Inefficiency Concerns
[[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | Mutual funds]] also present [[tax_inefficiencies_of_mutual_funds_in_taxable_accounts | tax inefficiency concerns]], especially when held in non-registered, taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>:
*   **Capital Gains Distribution**: [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | Mutual funds]] must distribute realized capital gains to investors annually, meaning investors may pay taxes on gains even if they haven't sold shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed funds engage in frequent trading, leading to numerous short-term capital gains taxed at higher regular income tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing**: Investors are at the mercy of the fund manager's decisions on when to realize gains or losses, potentially leading to taxable events at inopportune times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

To avoid these [[tax_inefficiencies_of_mutual_funds_in_taxable_accounts | tax inefficiencies]], investing in a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Industry Changes
While fees remain high, [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual fund]] fees in Canada have slightly decreased over the past few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. The introduction of fee-based advice and regulatory changes like the Client Focus Reforms have pushed the industry towards greater transparency and slightly lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Why They Remain Popular

*   **Ease of Access**: They are incredibly easy to access and convenient, offering a straightforward way to diversify without extensive market knowledge or large capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Distribution Channels**: Banks and financial advisors often push [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] due to aggressive sales targets, as they are a high-profit product for banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Perceived Professional Management**: Investors are drawn to the idea of professional portfolio managers, seen as experts who can make informed investment decisions, appealing to those preferring a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Considering [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | Alternatives]]
Given the high fees and consistent [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | underperformance]], investors should consider [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | other investment options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   **Robo-advisors**: Offer a cost-effective and convenient way to invest with lower fees (e.g., Questwealth, Wealthsimple) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

*   **DIY Stock Portfolios**: The most hands-on and potentially rewarding, allowing direct control, fee minimization, and tailored portfolios, but requires significant knowledge and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

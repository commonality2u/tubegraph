Even with a well-structured plan, certain missteps can hinder your progress towards achieving your financial goals, particularly within a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Avoiding these [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investments | common mistakes]] is crucial to reaching significant milestones, such as a $100,000 TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## Taking on Too Much Risk
Some investors pursue extreme growth by chasing speculative investments like meme stocks or cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While these may offer massive returns quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, they carry significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Why It's a Problem
These strategies are highly volatile and extremely risky, with a much higher chance of losing all your money than achieving very high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. High-risk investments are unpredictable and often lead to large losses rather than sustained growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Recovering from substantial losses can take years, derailing your TFSA growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Playing It Too Safe
Conversely, some investors choose low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or even cash accounts for their TFSA, believing it to be the safest option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Why It's a Problem
While these options protect your principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, they severely limit growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. For example, a 2% return on $10,000 would take 66 years to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Low returns often barely keep pace with inflation, leading to a decrease in purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, and you miss out on the compounding potential of higher-growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Trying to Time the Market
Many investors attempt to buy low and sell high, believing they can accurately predict market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Why It's a Problem
This strategy is incredibly difficult to execute consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Most people miss out on the market's best-performing days by waiting on the sidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Even financial professionals struggle to time the market accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, and the potential costs of being wrong often outweigh any benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Staying invested through market fluctuations typically outperforms attempts to predict swings for most retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Ignoring Fees
High fees, common with mutual funds, can significantly erode your returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Why It's a Problem
A 2% management fee on a $100,000 portfolio can cost tens of thousands of dollars over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Low-cost options like [[Common Investment Mistakes with ETFs | ETFs]] provide similar market exposure with much lower fees, allowing more of your money to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Not Understanding Your Investments and [[choosing_investments_and_managing_risk | Risk Tolerance]]
Before investing, it's crucial to understand how an investment works and whether it aligns with your [[developing_an_investment_philosophy | risk tolerance]] and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It's easy to be enticed by trendy assets like Bitcoin or popular tech stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Why It's a Problem
Many investors overestimate their capacity to handle risk, leading to poor decisions when markets become volatile and investments decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Being honest about your comfort level and building a portfolio that suits it is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

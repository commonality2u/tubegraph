Many Canadians are considering leaving the country due to various challenges, with a significant increase in those moving to the U.S. in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. In 2022, the number of Canadians moving to the U.S. alone reached 126,340 people, which is a staggering 70% increase from the 75,752 people who made the move in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. It's estimated that approximately 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad in 2016, and this number has likely increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Why People Consider Leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
The primary reasons people want to leave Canada include:
*   **Rising Cost of Living** The rising cost of living, particularly in cities like Toronto and Vancouver where housing prices have skyrocketed, is a major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Moving to countries like Mexico, Portugal, or parts of the United States can significantly reduce living expenses, offering more affordable housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Harsh Winters** Canada's harsh winters, with temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, drive many to seek milder climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare System Challenges** Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces challenges such as long wait times for medical services and a low doctor-to-population ratio, leading to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. According to the Commonwealth Fund, Canada ranks poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Adventure and New Experiences** Living abroad also offers opportunities for adventure, personal growth, and immersion in new cultures, cuisines, and ways of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Steps to Make the Move Abroad

### Step 1: Make Sure You Want to Leave Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
Before making a permanent move, consider a trial run by spending a few weeks or months living in the country or countries you are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This hands-on experience is crucial to determine if the new lifestyle fits you and can prevent future regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Try to live as much like a local as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. During a trial run, you might discover issues like safety concerns, a closed-off culture, or miss friends, family, and aspects of Canadian life like its healthcare system and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Step 2: Making Money Abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
Unless you are incredibly wealthy, you'll need a plan to make money while living overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Here are three popular paths:

*   **Expat Through Company Transfer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
    *   **How:** Seek opportunities within your current company, express interest in international positions to HR, and network with colleagues who have worked abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** This route offers job security, maintained benefits, and relocation assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. International experience can also boost your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** You may have less flexibility over location and work assignments, adapting to a new work culture can be challenging, and it usually requires a longer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

*   **Remote Work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>
    *   **How:** Find jobs through websites like `remote.co`, `weworkremotely`, and `flexjobs` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Set up a home office with reliable internet and necessary tools, and manage your time effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Offers flexibility to work from anywhere with internet, saving time and money on commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** Can be isolating, requires high self-motivation and time management, and may offer less job security and fewer benefits than full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Remote workers are often in software or IT, but can also be from HR, sales, or even law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Digital Nomad** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
    *   **How:** Develop a freelance skill or service (e.g., writing, graphic design, programming, consulting) and build an online portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Find clients on freelance websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Benefits:** Offers freedom to travel and experience new cultures, working for multiple clients can be more stable than a single job, and it fosters personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Digital nomads engage in diverse fields such as digital marketing, startups, content creation, and even therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   **Challenges:** Income can be unpredictable, balancing work and travel can be challenging, and navigating visas and work permits can be complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. You might also grow tired of not having a home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Step 3: Becoming a Non-Resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>
To become a non-resident of Canada for tax purposes, you must sever significant residential ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This includes actions such as selling your home, closing bank accounts, and relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The biggest factor is where you spend your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. It's essential to keep documentation of your new residency status, such as rental agreements and utility bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

You should be aware of the [[departure_tax_and_its_implications | departure tax]] which applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties, as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This means you'll need to pay tax on the unrealized gains of your investments and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, [[impact_on_rrsp_for_nonresidents | RRSPs]], RRIFs, and certain real estate are exempt from this tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. These deemed dispositions must be reported on your final tax return, and any capital gains tax on unrealized gains must be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Regarding other accounts and benefits:
*   Your [[Non Resident Contributions to TFSAs | TFSA]] can remain open, but you cannot make contributions while you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Earnings within it will still be tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   You can keep your [[impact_on_rrsp_for_nonresidents | RRSP]] and RRIF accounts, though withdrawals will be subject to a 25% withholding tax, which may be reducible by tax treaties depending on your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   You can continue receiving CPP payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   For [[oas_benefits_and_tax_implications_for_nonresidents | OAS]], you'll be eligible to receive payments outside of Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. For more details on how your TFSA, RRSP, CPP, and OAS are affected, further research is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Step 4: Understanding Your New Country's Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
While becoming a non-resident of Canada is relatively straightforward, understanding the rules of your new country can be more challenging, especially with potential distance and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. To ensure a smooth transition, figure out the following:

*   **Residency and Tax Laws**: Research the residency requirements, including applying for temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Some countries require you to register your address with local authorities upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident and look into tax treaties with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Visa Laws**: Understand the different visa options and choose the one that fits your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Familiarize yourself with required documents, timelines, and conditions, including restrictions on work, study, and length of stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Know the procedures for renewing your visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Learn what it takes to open a local bank account by choosing a reputable bank and preparing necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Understand local currency exchange rates and the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Other Important Regulations**:
    *   **Healthcare**: Learn about the healthcare system and whether you need to purchase health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Driving**: Understand local driving laws and requirements, including the need for international driving permits or converting your Canadian license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   **Legal Requirements**: Learn about local laws and emergency services to avoid legal issues and ensure your safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Step 5: Explore Getting Citizenship Elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
Securing citizenship in a new country offers benefits such as stability, access to local services, and full integration into the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Common pathways include:

*   **Citizenship by Naturalization**: This usually involves living and working in a country for a specific period, often requiring continuous residency, compliance with local laws, and passing a language or cultural integration test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. For example, in Germany, you might apply after five years of working there, meeting language and integration requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Investment**: Some countries grant citizenship in exchange for significant financial investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. For instance, Turkey offers citizenship if you purchase real estate worth at least $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This process involves making the required investment and meeting any additional residency or legal requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Relatives and Ancestry**: If you have parents, grandparents, or even great-grandparents from another country, you might be eligible for citizenship by descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. For example, you could apply for Italian citizenship with Italian ancestry or Irish citizenship with an Irish grandparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This typically involves gathering relevant certificates (e.g., birth and marriage records) and submitting them to the consulate or embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Other Ways**: Marrying a citizen from another country can often speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Some countries, like the UAE, grant citizenship for exceptional skills in fields such as science or culture, usually involving a nomination or application demonstrating contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Bonus Tip: Researching Cost of Living with Numbeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>
To estimate the cost of living in a new country, use the website `numbeo.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
1.  Go to the "Cost of Living Comparison" menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
2.  Type in your current city (e.g., Toronto) and the city you want to move to (e.g., Mexico City) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
3.  The tool will provide a breakdown of costs, showing, for example, that the cost of living in Mexico City is 37% lower than in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
You can drill down to specific costs, such as restaurant prices being almost 40% cheaper in Mexico City than in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. While the data is user-entered, it is often very accurate for popular cities, providing a good ballpark estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

If you are seriously considering moving countries, it is highly recommended to talk to a cross-border tax specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

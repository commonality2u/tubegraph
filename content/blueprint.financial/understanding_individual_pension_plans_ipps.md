Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) are powerful retirement savings tools tailored specifically for business owners or incorporated professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Unlike a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) which has a set contribution cap, an IPP allows you to put away more money, especially if you are over 40, while still enjoying tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

An IPP is essentially a corporate-sponsored pension plan designed to provide structured retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It is a go-to choice for high-income earners who seek a more strategic way to save for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## How an IPP Replaces RSPs

While an RSP is often described as a "savings account on steroids," an IPP is more akin to a personalized pension plan that is structured, powerful, and built for long-term security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For those earning well and looking to maximize retirement savings, an IPP can be a more suitable choice than an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Key differences include:
*   **Reduced RSP Contributions** Once an IPP is established, your ability to contribute to an RSP is either reduced or eliminated because the IPP takes priority in pension contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Larger Contributions** IPPs permit significantly higher contributions than RSPs, particularly as you age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This enables greater tax deferral and faster growth of retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Reliable Retirement Income** With an IPP, retirement withdrawals follow a structured pension-like system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Unlike an RSP, where you control withdrawal timing and amounts, an IPP provides predictable income, aiding in more confident retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It is very similar to a defined benefit pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## When an IPP Outperforms an RSP

IPPs offer distinct advantages in various real-world scenarios:

### High-Income Business Owner
Daniel, a 50-year-old business owner earning $250,000 annually, had already maxed out his RSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Instead of being limited to the 2024 RSP cap of $31,560, he established an IPP, allowing him to contribute over $50,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This strategy significantly increased his tax deductions and boosted his retirement savings for long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Late Start to Retirement Savings
Linda, a 55-year-old professional with her own corporation, realized she hadn't saved enough for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. By setting up an IPP, she could make "past service contributions" that covered previous working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This action rapidly grew her retirement fund while simultaneously reducing her corporation's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Corporate Tax Efficiency
Ryan, a 40-something incorporated consultant, switched from an RSP to an IPP for a more tax-efficient strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. IPP contributions are considered a corporate expense, which reduced his company's taxable income, leading to lower corporate taxes while ensuring a stable and secure retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### IPP Success Story
One client, a doctor, increased his tax deductions by over 50% compared to his RSP contributions after switching to an IPP, securing a steady pension for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Considerations for IPPs

Setting up an IPP can be complex, but it offers significant tax and retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Professional guidance is often recommended to ensure the IPP fits into long-term financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Understanding how IPPs, private equity, and [[comparing_rrsps_with_ipps_and_family_trusts | Family Trusts]] work can unlock substantial tax savings and smarter wealth protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

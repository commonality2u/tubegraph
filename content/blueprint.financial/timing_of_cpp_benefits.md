Despite over 95% of Canadians starting their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 often proves [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | optimal]] for many, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Deciding when to take CPP is one of the most impactful retirement choices, acting as a retirement puzzle where elements like life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams must fit together to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | maximize]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## CPP Basics and Impact of Starting Age

Most Canadians claim CPP at age 60, with over 70% starting benefits at either age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. However, options exist for starting between ages 61-64 and 66-70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

*   **Starting at Age 60**: Choosing to start CPP at age 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction from age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, if Sarah qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, she'd receive $640 per month at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70**: [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | Delaying]] CPP until age 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Using Sarah's example, her monthly payments would jump to $1,420 at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Insights from the 2020 Actuarial CPP Report

A 2020 Actuarial study on CPP take-up decisions provides key insights into optimal starting ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 60

This option is generally best for those who need immediate income or have health concerns suggesting a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Permanent Drawbacks**: It ensures early access to funds but comes with a 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65, significantly impacting long-term income for those living past around age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **High Investment Returns**: If investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking CPP at 60 allows for investment of payments, potentially leading to a better outcome but with higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations**: Starting at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] and [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits, smoothing income across retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario**: John, a 60-year-old with health issues and minimal savings, claims CPP early to secure income and avoid GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 65

This default option offers a balance, providing steady payments and removing the need for savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It suits retirees with below-average to [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | average life expectancy]] and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income**: It offers reliable, inflation-adjusted income without additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: There is potential income left on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis**: Payments typically equalize with the 70-option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those uncertain about longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario**: Maria, aged 65 with modest RSP savings and average health, takes CPP now to maintain a predictable income without depleting her savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to 70

[[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_60 | Delaying]] CPP provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, with maximum inflation-adjusted payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This option is ideal for those with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Longevity Protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to approximately 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age**: For most, [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying]] CPP becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Example Scenario**: Susan, aged 70, expects to live into her late 80s or 90s and has sufficient RSP funds. She decides to [[financial_incentives_for_delaying_cpp | delay]] CPP to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | maximize]] her lifetime inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## The Importance of Life Expectancy

A crucial factor in the CPP decision is an individual's estimated life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Odds of Living Past 80

The 2020 CPP take-up decision report highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Gender Differences**: Women tend to live longer than men, with 82% of women likely to live past age 80, making [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_on_benefits | delaying]] CPP especially beneficial for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle and Family History**: A healthy lifestyle or a family history of long life increases the odds of living past 80 to 79% for men and 85% for women, making [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delayed]] CPP a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **General Benefit of Delaying**: Even with low longevity expectations, most Canadians are expected to live past 80, suggesting that the majority of retirees could benefit from waiting to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | maximize]] lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Stats Canada Life Expectancy Data

More recent data from Statistics Canada indicates that the older an individual is, the longer their remaining life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live to nearly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Key Takeaways**:
    *   Life expectancy in Canada is generally longer than commonly realized (above 80-82 for middle-aged individuals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Women benefit more from [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying]] CPP as they live longer across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Men with shorter life expectancies should carefully consider their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | Delaying]] CPP acts as longevity insurance, especially for women who may face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Strategic planning, integrating CPP timing with RSP withdrawals and other income, is key for optimized retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Online Life Expectancy Calculators and Refinements

Several online calculators can provide life expectancy estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits, quick to complete (5 minutes), offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, delves deeper with detailed questions (10-20 minutes), provides personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   While these calculators offer tailored outlooks, their results can differ (e.g., by 4 years), so they should be taken with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

For deeper refinement of life expectancy estimates, consider:
*   **Genetic Testing**: Can uncover health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations**: Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing**: Advanced tests that measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings**: Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, crucial for impacting longevity, recommended annually starting in one's 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## CPP Present Value Calculator

While comparing life expectancy to a CPP break-even table is a good starting point, it falls short by not considering factors like investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Instead, a CPP present value calculator, such as the one found on TaxTips.ca, provides a more accurate estimate by incorporating these additional factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### How the Calculator Works

The calculator allows users to input their estimated monthly benefit at age 65 (e.g., $1,000), an estimated annual indexation (inflation rate, e.g., 2.5%), and evaluate start ages (e.g., 60, 65, 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
Crucially, it allows for:
*   **Life Expectancy Input**: Users input their estimated life expectancy (e.g., 86 for an average 50-year-old Canadian woman) to calculate the present value of cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Rate of Return Input**: An estimated rate of return for the portfolio (e.g., 2%, 4%, or 6%) significantly impacts the present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
    *   A lower rate of return (e.g., 2%) might show age 70 as having the highest present value (e.g., $320,000 compared to $222,000 at 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   A higher rate of return (e.g., 4%) can significantly close the gap between choices (e.g., 60 at $170,000, 65 at $208,000, 70 at $220,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   At 6% return, age 65 and 70 choices might even out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. A more conservative rate (3-5%) is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Impact of Life Expectancy**:
    *   Living longer (e.g., to 100) makes [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying]] to 70 the best choice by far, providing substantially more value (e.g., $130,000 present value difference, $500,000 cumulative difference over starting at 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   A shorter life expectancy (e.g., passing away at 72) clearly indicates that taking CPP at age 60 would have been most beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Inflation Rate Impact**: The estimated annual indexation rate for CPP payments also greatly affects the analysis, though it is difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

The present value calculation is crucial because it accounts for the time value of money, which simple break-even analyses do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Comprehensive CPP Planning

Deciding when to start CPP is a complex puzzle, and a comprehensive approach ensures optimal retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Financial planning considers several additional factors:
*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points**: Running scenarios based on how long an individual is likely to live and when [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying]] CPP starts to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies**: Analyzing how CPP income interacts with the overall tax situation to potentially reduce or increase tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining whether [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_on_benefits | delaying]] CPP could help avoid the OAS clawback, or if starting earlier is a better option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating CPP with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

Most often, benefits are seen by [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_60 | delaying]] CPP into the late 60s or 70s, though exceptions exist based on individual scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

The [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | Old Age Security]] (OAS) program is a key component of Canadian retirement income. For Canadians planning to leave Canada permanently, understanding how OAS benefits and their tax implications are affected is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This includes navigating tax implications and potential benefit losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## OAS Basics
[[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] is based on the time an individual spent in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It can be collected as early as age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, with the option to delay collection up to age 70 for increased benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Eligibility for Expatriates
To receive [[oas_eligibility_and_taxes_when_retiring_overseas | OAS abroad]], you generally must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Even if you haven't met the 20-year threshold, you might still qualify if you:
*   Worked abroad for a Canadian company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Lived in a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   A full list of these countries is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   However, years spent in these countries under a social security agreement do not count towards the total [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] benefit amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## OAS Benefits While Living Abroad
If you meet the eligibility requirements, the [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] benefit amount remains the same regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

However, certain additional [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] benefits require Canadian residency:
*   **Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**: Requires you to reside in Canada to receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Survivor Allowance**: Requires you to reside in Canada to receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Moving abroad will disqualify you from receiving GIS and other allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Tax Implications for Expatriates
[[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | Tax considerations]] for [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] benefits when living abroad are important:

*   **OAS Clawback (Recovery Tax)**: High-income earners may face the [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] clawback, which applies to earnings over a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This clawback still applies abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   It may be bypassed if you move to a country with a tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   Non-residents typically must file a T136 form annually to determine any required repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Withholding Tax**: Countries without a tax treaty with Canada may impose a withholding tax on [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments, typically around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
    *   For example, if you move to the US, there will be no withholding tax on your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] due to the tax treaty between Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   It is always important to check the tax treaty details for your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

*   **Annual Tax Return**: To collect [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] abroad, you must file an annual tax return reporting your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Income Management
If you are at risk of the [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] clawback, consider managing your income through strategic withdrawals from other retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[0:10:19]</a>. Also, consider deferring [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments up to age 72 to increase your monthly benefit by 0.6% for each month deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Professional Advice
It is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional when considering moving abroad to understand specific details and implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Ideally, seek advice from professionals in both Canada and your intended country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

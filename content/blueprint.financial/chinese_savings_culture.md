The average Chinese household saves between 36% and over 40% of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This is significantly higher than Canada's 6.9% savings rate or the US's 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For individuals of Chinese ethnicity, such as the speaker whose grandparents settled in Malaysia and who grew up in Canada, saving money was a core household value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This stark contrast between high-saving [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | cultures]] and low-saving ones can lead to a "cultural clash" within families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This article explores the reasons behind the strong savings habits in Chinese culture, how some of these habits can be adopted, and highlights the [[negative_aspects_of_excessive_saving | darker side of saving too much]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Pillars of Chinese Savings Habits

Several key [[economic_habits_of_chinese_immigrant_families | economic habits of Chinese immigrant families]] contribute to their high savings rates.

### 1. Turning Deals into a Hobby

For many first-generation Asian parents in Canada or the US, getting a good deal is a passion, often centered around stores like Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Costco, for them, is akin to Disneyland, offering the thrill of saving money on every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This pursuit of deals can become a competitive sport among family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Children of Asian parents often learn to underreport the cost of their purchases to avoid a disapproving "Asian parent glare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This isn't about being cheap; it's rooted in past experiences where money was scarce, making finding a good deal a honed survival skill and a source of pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### 2. Focus on High-Earning Careers

In Chinese culture, particularly among immigrant families, money and prestige are crucial. They symbolize security, respect, and the potential to transform a family's future within a single generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Many immigrants start from scratch, working tirelessly to secure a better life for their children, making financial success essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The drive for children to become doctors, as comedian Ronnie Chiang jokes, is less about helping others and more about gaining respect and financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Becoming a doctor is seen as the fastest way to elevate a family from struggling immigrants to respected professionals, ensuring significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. While this focus can lead to significant achievements, it may also pressure children into careers they are not passionate about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This highlights a cultural difference: North America tends to focus on enjoying life now, while China emphasizes [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | saving for the future and maintaining financial independence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### 3. Developing a Scarcity Mindset

A [[scarcity_mindset_and_its_effects | scarcity mindset]] is common among many Chinese people, especially immigrants, stemming from experiences of growing up with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This belief that "there's never enough"—be it money, opportunities, or security—often originates from witnessing financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Having grown up in a historically poor country, this mindset makes individuals hyper-aware of spending, always hunting for deals, and planning for the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It affects all aspects of life, fostering cautious financial habits and a deep appreciation for what one has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, even when financially secure, this fear of not having enough can lead to a reluctance to take risks or enjoy what has been earned, causing ongoing stress and saving for a "rainy day that might never come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The key is to find a balance between caution and optimism, recognizing financial stability to then enjoy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 4. Strong Distaste for Debt

In North America, spending is culturally ingrained, with debt often viewed as a necessary tool to achieve a certain standard of living, used for everything from houses to everyday purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. In contrast, Chinese culture has a strong aversion to debt, viewing borrowing money as risky or irresponsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. From a young age, individuals are taught to spend only what they've earned and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This approach stems from a history of economic uncertainty, emphasizing financial stability and self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Being debt-free is a source of pride, reflecting financial control and a stable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This contrasts sharply with North American norms, where high credit card balances and minimum payments are common, unlike the Chinese emphasis on paying off the full amount every month to avoid interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### 5. Embracing Zero-Based Budgeting

The concept of a zero-based budgeting system aligns well with traditional Chinese values of careful financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This method involves planning every cent of income, ensuring that by month-end, every amount is accounted for, leaving a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The idea is to be intentional with money, maximizing the use of every penny and avoiding unnecessary expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This budgeting method encourages discipline and careful planning, both highly valued in Chinese culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. While it can seem rigid, it is an effective way to stay on top of finances and ensure money works optimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### 6. Hating Waste

A defining characteristic of Chinese culture is an aversion to waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This applies to food, money, and even plastic bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. It's common to find separate compartments for hoarded plastic bags in Asian households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Children are often reminded to finish their plates, and leftovers are always repurposed for the next day's lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This isn't just about being frugal; it's about respect for the effort put into acquiring possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Old clothes are kept for house wear, takeout containers are washed and reused, and even tiny food scraps are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This mindset fosters appreciation and resourcefulness, and is good for the environment, but it can also be tiring, leading to guilt over wanting to discard something or buy new items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### 7. Prioritizing Eating at Home

Eating at home is central to Chinese culture, simultaneously saving money and bringing families together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Home-cooked meals are fresh, healthy, and significantly cheaper than dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Meal planning and home cooking are second nature in Chinese households, allowing for traditional dishes that might be expensive or difficult to find in restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Leftovers are routinely used for the next day's lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While Chinese households do eat out, it's typically reserved for special occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Eating at home connects individuals to their culture and family, offering both savings and the comfort of home-cooked meals, often leading to large family gatherings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## The Dark Side of Excessive Saving

While saving is generally positive, it can become a burden when driven by fear and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. In China, many save excessively due to fear of unexpected expenses, job loss, or societal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This "survival instinct on overdrive" often leads to sacrificing present enjoyment for future security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. There's significant cultural pressure, especially from [[family_structure_and_intergenerational_support_in_chinese_culture | family]], to save for major expenses like weddings, homes, or caring for aging parents, creating constant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

[[negative_aspects_of_excessive_saving | Excessive saving]] can also harm the economy. When people save too much and spend less, it reduces money circulation, slowing business activity and potentially leading to deflation, which can worsen economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. A lack of trust in social safety nets like pensions or healthcare also drives many to save out of necessity or fear, leading to ongoing anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. While saving is important, when driven by fear or pressure, it can cause significant stress and economic issues; finding a balance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

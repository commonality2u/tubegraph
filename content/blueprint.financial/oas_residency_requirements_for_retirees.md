The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is based on an individual's residency, unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) which is based on contributions during working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. When considering [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_implications_for_expatriates | retiring abroad]], it is crucial to understand the specific residency requirements for OAS to ensure continued eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Core Residency Rule for OAS Abroad

To receive OAS while living outside of Canada, the primary rule is that you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If this 20-year threshold is met, your monthly OAS payments will continue, even if you are living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For example, if someone moved to Canada at age 25 and lived there for 30 years before retiring to Spain, they would continue to receive their full OAS payments abroad because they met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. OAS can be thought of as a "loyalty card" that only works after 20 or more years of Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Impact of Not Meeting the 20-Year Rule

If you do not meet the 20-year residency rule, your OAS payments could stop if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months after the month of your departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This means if you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for over six months, your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. To restart payments, you would need to return to Canada and re-establish residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Exceptions: Social Security Agreements

There are exceptions to the 20-year rule. You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. In such cases, the combined time you lived in both countries must be at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. It is important to note that the years lived in another country do not increase your OAS amount; they only help determine if you qualify to keep receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Taxation of OAS Payments Abroad

Your OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, federal tax is not automatically withheld each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. You can request voluntary tax deductions by logging into your My Service Canada account or by filling out the relevant form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

OAS may also be subject to a non-resident withholding tax, with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. If you reside in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, this rate may be reduced or eliminated entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example:
*   If you move to the U.S., Canada's tax treaty means your OAS is generally not subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   If you move to Germany, a tax treaty is in place, but it does not eliminate withholding tax on OAS. Instead, under Article 18 of the Canada-Germany tax treaty, Canada may tax public pensions like OAS at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. You might end up paying about a 15% withholding tax on your OAS payments while living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip annually instead of a T4, and you must include it when filing your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. It is mandatory to continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### OAS Recovery Tax (Clawback)

The OAS recovery tax, also known as the clawback, begins at an income threshold of $93,454 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. If you are concerned about hitting this income threshold, strategies such as managing taxable income through RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. These strategies are part of [[investment_strategies_and_managing_withdrawals_to_maintain_oas_benefits_in_retirement | investment strategies and managing withdrawals to maintain OAS benefits in retirement]].

## Case Study: Anita's Retirement to Portugal

Anita, a 67-year-old, retired to Portugal after spending 22 years living and working in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. She qualified for her CPP and became eligible for OAS because she crossed the 20-year residency threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. She moved to Portugal, which has both a social security and tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Upon her move:
*   Her OAS continues because she met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. If she had moved a year earlier (at 19 years of residency), she would have received nothing until returning to Canada or qualifying through a treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Her Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) stopped after six months, as it requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround or treaty protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Her CPP continued without interruption, with a reduced 15% withholding tax thanks to the tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Anita's successful [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement planning for Canadian expats]] included delaying her move until she met the 20-year residency requirement for OAS and choosing a treaty country like Portugal to reduce tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Summary of OAS Behavior Abroad

OAS is a selective "travel companion." It will only accompany you if you have built a strong enough relationship with Canada, meaning 20-plus years of living in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. If this condition is not met, OAS might stay home unless you have "mutual friends" in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

When examining Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) holdings, it's crucial to understand the difference between median and average data, as averages can be skewed by high-income earners and outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Median data generally provides a more realistic snapshot of what Canadians have saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The data presented here combines RRSPs, RRIFs, and LIRA information from Statistics Canada's latest available information from 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Why Median is a Better Indicator
Medians are superior indicators compared to averages because averages can be heavily influenced by a few individuals with very high savings and earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. For instance, at age 65 and older, the median RRSP balance is significantly higher than the average, indicating that the average figures are skewed by a small number of high-income outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Therefore, using the median for personal comparison is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## RRSP Holdings by Age Group: Median vs. Average
Examining RRSP holdings by age reveals substantial differences between median and average balances, highlighting varying levels of retirement preparedness across different life stages.

### Age 65 and Older
For Canadians aged 65 and older, there is a significant disparity between median and average savings:
*   **Median:** $224,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
*   **Average:** $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
This stark difference indicates that the average is heavily influenced by a small number of very high-saving, high-earning individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. While the median is $224,000 at this stage, it's noted that many retirees may still rely heavily on government benefits like CPP and OAS, as private savings might not cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Younger Canadians (Under 35)
Canadians under 35 have a median RRSP balance of just $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This suggests that many young adults have minimal retirement savings, making it crucial for them to start contributing consistently as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Midlife Savings Growth (35 to 54)
For individuals aged 35 to 54, savings generally improve, with a median balance ranging from $30,000 to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, this amount is often insufficient for a secure retirement, as many in this age group are balancing mortgages, family expenses, and career demands, making consistent retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Nearing Retirement (55 to 64)
Canadians aged 55 to 64 see their median savings grow to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While an improvement, this is often still not enough to sustain a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Some individuals in this group are in a better financial position, with an average balance of over $216,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, but many will need additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

</div>
The specific median and average data for RRSP holdings by age group were derived from 2019 Statistics Canada information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The more recent national average for all RRSP accounts was $113,000 in 2023, down from $144,000 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This recent drop reflects a return to more normal savings levels after pandemic-induced spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While the national average balance dropped, the average contribution *grew* to $6,651 in 2023, up from $5,750 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

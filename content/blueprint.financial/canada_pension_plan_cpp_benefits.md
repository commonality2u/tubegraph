Many Canadians believe that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement, but relying heavily on these benefits alone can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article breaks down expected CPP benefits, what life on these benefits can look like, and key considerations for retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Understanding the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is structured based on an individual's lifetime earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher contribution amount during working years leads to a higher payout in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, most individuals do not receive the maximum CPP amount, as it necessitates decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### CPP Payouts in 2025

The following figures illustrate the approximate monthly CPP payouts for [[canada_pension_plan_2025_updates | 2025]] at various ages:

*   **Starting at Age 60** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 65** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 70** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $2,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

### Key Takeaways for CPP Benefits

*   **Early vs. Delayed Payments**: Taking CPP early significantly reduces your monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Delaying until age 70 can boost your benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, it requires being able to afford the delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Income Replacement**: CPP is designed to replace approximately 25% to 33% of your working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This can be used as a general [[estimating_cpp_benefits | rule of thumb to estimate your CPP benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Pension

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not based on employment income and is available regardless of work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and deferral choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### OAS Maximum Monthly Payments (March 2025)

*   **Age 65 to 74**: $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **Age 75 and Older**: Jumps by 10% to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An automatic 10% increase occurs at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

If an individual's total income is very low, they may qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), a government benefit designed to help very low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Maximum GIS (2024)**: $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Income Impact**: GIS is reduced dollar for dollar if additional income is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Even small withdrawals from RRSPs can affect eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Exclusion**: OAS does not count toward GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Combined Income from CPP, OAS, and GIS

For those with no other income sources, total retirement income might combine these benefits. An example could be $800 from CPP, $700 from OAS, and $500 from GIS, totaling about $2,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, relying solely on CPP, OAS, and GIS means living barely above the poverty line and is not considered a comfortable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. [[Impact of CPP on other benefits like OAS and GIS]] is significant for those with low income.

## Cost of Living Breakdown

Living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada is technically possible but requires serious sacrifices and is not comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Major Expenses

*   **Housing**:
    *   **Owned Home**: If owned outright, costs are lower, but still include property taxes, maintenance, and utilities ($500+ per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Rent**: Even in smaller cities, minimum rent is around $1,000 per month, potentially consuming over half of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Major cities like Toronto or Vancouver have rents that easily exceed $2,000 per month for a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: A basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month, with dining out being rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs**: For those under 65 without provincial coverage, private insurance may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be significant expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: Electricity, heating, internet, and phone are ongoing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership adds insurance, gas, and maintenance ($200-$500 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, while public transit costs at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations

Living solely on CPP and OAS offers no budget for travel or major purchases like furniture, appliances, or a new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. An emergency fund is unlikely, leading to living month-to-month and potentially relying on family, food banks, or community support for unexpected bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This constitutes a barebones lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Is it Enough? A Reality Check

For most people, relying solely on CPP and OAS is not enough for a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### When it Could Work

*   **Owned Home Outright**: No mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners might also consider borrowing against their home or downsizing to free up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Area**: Living in small towns or rural parts of Canada offers more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Shared Housing Costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Extra Support**: Help from family, investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant financial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For instance, a mortgage-free retiree in small-town Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work, but only with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When it Falls Apart

*   **Major City Costs**: High cost of living in major cities makes it very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances without savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **No Savings**: Living month-to-month creates a financial balancing act without an emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Most Canadians do not wish to spend their retirement constantly worrying about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Strategies if CPP and OAS Aren't Enough

If government benefits alone won't cover expenses, there are ways to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   **Delay CPP and OAS**: Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP can grow by 42% and OAS by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Part-Time Work or Delay Retirement**: Picking up part-time work or delaying full retirement can ensure money lasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**: Downsizing can free up capital, and relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or even abroad can make money go farther <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Government Benefits**: Take advantage of programs like the Allowance for the Survivor for additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning**: Strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower your [[tax_implications_of_cpp | tax burden]] and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A free guide with five proven strategies to save more on taxes in retirement is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Creative Retirement Approaches

Some retirees adopt unconventional strategies to make a limited income work:

*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or house-sitting to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Hobbies into Income**: Monetizing skills through teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Using programs like Trusted Housesitters to live for free by house-sitting around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend of slow traveling through low-cost countries, using extended tourist visas to live for months in places where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

For example, a retiree in Mexico was able to live on approximately $1,500 a month, including $600 for rent and daily dining out, by taking advantage of lower costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Others have house-sat in Europe and the US to reduce living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For more information on what happens to your CPP and OAS when living outside Canada, refer to resources on [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP benefits abroad]] and [[understanding_cpp_benefits_when_living_outside_canada | understanding CPP benefits when living outside Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

These alternative retirements, often in countries like Mexico, Thailand, or Portugal, can offer a higher quality of life for the same income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, healthcare access can be a concern, and this lifestyle is typically embraced by active and healthy retirees in their 60s or early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Conclusion: Plan for Your Retirement

Relying solely on CPP and OAS requires a backup plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The earlier you plan, the more options you have to ensure financial freedom in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If still working, it's crucial to put a plan in place to avoid relying solely on these government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

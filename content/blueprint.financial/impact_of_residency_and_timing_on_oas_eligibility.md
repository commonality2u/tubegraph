Many Canadians, especially immigrants, may not realize that their eligibility for government pensions like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) is significantly affected by when they moved to Canada and where they choose to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This can lead to substantial differences in payouts over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## OAS Eligibility and Residency Requirements

Unlike CPP, which is based on work contributions, [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | Old Age Security OAS benefits]] are primarily determined by residency in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. It is not an automatic benefit, and many individuals are surprised to find they do not qualify for the full amount or any amount at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Key residency requirements for OAS:
*   **10 Years**: This is the minimum residency in Canada after age 18 to receive any OAS benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **40 Years**: To qualify for the full OAS payment, an individual needs 40 years of residency in Canada after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **20 Years**: Crucially for immigrants, if you plan to retire outside of Canada, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after the age of 18 to continue receiving OAS benefits while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Impact of Late Arrival and Retiring Abroad

Immigrating later in life can significantly reduce your OAS entitlement. For example, if someone immigrates to Canada at age 50 and retires at 65, they will have only 15 years of residency after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This would result in receiving only 15 out of 40 years of potential OAS payments, equating to approximately 37.5% of the full OAS amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Furthermore, if an immigrant decides to move back to their home country or retire abroad without meeting the 20-year minimum residency, they could lose their OAS benefits entirely once they leave Canada, depending on the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### International Social Security Agreements

Canada has [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | international social security agreements]] with many countries, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These agreements can assist in qualifying for OAS even if the full time hasn't been spent in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Under these agreements, Canada may count time spent in certain other countries towards the 10-year or 20-year residency minimums for OAS eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. However, it's important to note that this time does *not* count towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS, meaning recipients will likely still receive only partial OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Therefore, both where you have lived and the country you retire in significantly impact your OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Financial Implications

The value of OAS benefits over a lifetime can be substantial, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. For those who fully qualify for OAS (ages 65-74), it can be nearly $9,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Over a 25-year retirement, maxing out both CPP and OAS could accumulate to between $460,000 and $648,000 in today's dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Since OAS benefits are inflation-indexed, their actual dollar value received over time is even higher, potentially reaching $580,000 to $815,000 with a modest 2% annual increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

If you immigrated to Canada later in life or plan to retire abroad, you might receive only a fraction of this potential amount or even lose your OAS entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This represents a massive difference in retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Strategies for Immigrants to Protect OAS

Even with reduced OAS eligibility, immigrants can take steps to secure their retirement income:

*   **[[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying CPP and OAS Payments]]**: If financially feasible, delaying OAS until age 70 can increase the monthly benefit by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This can be a powerful way to boost income over the course of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Build Personal Retirement Income**: Do not rely solely on government benefits. Focus on personal savings vehicles such as RRSPs, TFSAs, and other investments to build a strong retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Check for Social Security Agreements**: Verify if Canada has an agreement with your home country or desired retirement destination. These agreements can help meet OAS residency minimums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. If you are close to the 20-year OAS threshold and plan to retire in a country without an agreement, it might be beneficial to delay your move for a couple of years to secure the portability of your OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Understand Residency Rules Before Leaving**: If considering retiring abroad, know that OAS may stop if you leave Canada for more than 6 months, unless you meet the 20-year residency requirement or are covered by a specific social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning**: Coordinate RRSP and TFSA withdrawals to minimize taxable income and help with [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks | avoiding OAS Clawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Consider income splitting with a spouse to lower overall tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, and be mindful of foreign exchange risk and international tax implications for investment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone, representing a staggering 37.8% of this age group. This includes individuals who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Retiring solo significantly alters the [[financial_planning_for_retirees | planning required for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Understanding these unique challenges can prevent major financial mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Median After-Tax Income for Seniors (2022)

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older illustrates a significant disparity:
*   **For couples**: $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **For single seniors**: Only $30,820 per year (approximately $2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Biggest Financial Risks for Single Retirees

Retiring alone presents unique [[challenges_of_retirement_in_canada | financial challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Without a partner to split costs, share benefits, or provide a safety net, every dollar becomes more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Single individuals often face higher taxes, less government support, and greater pressure to manage all aspects of their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity and Investment Risk)
This is the top fear in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Couples share expenses, split bills, and benefit from tax savings, whereas singles must cover all expenses alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This significantly increases the risk of running out of money for single retirees, as they lack a partner's pension or extra savings and need more savings to cover the same lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

**Strategies**:
*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: The 4% rule is a solid benchmark, but single retirees may need to adjust this lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Diversify Investments**: A mix of growth (stocks) and safety (bonds, GICs) helps ensure funds don't deplete too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Careful [[financial_planning_for_retirees | Retirement Financial Planning]]**: Working with a financial planner to build a customized strategy considering lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden
Being single often means paying more in taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Without access to income splitting or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently fall into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For instance, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income due to income splitting and eligibility for full OAS and age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Strategies**:
*   **Strategic Withdrawals**: How and when money is taken from RRSPs, TFSAs, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the net amount retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs
Inflation is a "silent wealth killer" that erodes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. When single, there is no one to share the burden of increasing costs for groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Planning for inflation is essential for a retirement that could last 30 or more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

**Creative Strategies to Combat Inflation**:
*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space**: Unlocking home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **[[exploring_alternative_retirement_living_arrangements | Exploring Co-living]]**: Living with friends or house hacking to reduce fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocating**: Moving to lower-cost provinces or countries to stretch retirement dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits
A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the lack of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there are no automatic rollovers for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death, which can lead to a substantial tax hit on the estate and less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited support for single retirees, reducing guaranteed income options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

**Strategies to Protect Assets**:
*   **Plan RRSP and RIF Withdrawals Carefully**: Gradual withdrawals can help reduce the final tax burden on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review**: Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance designations are current to ensure assets go as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support
Loneliness can also be a financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies indicate that single retirees are more prone to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**Strategies to Stay Connected and Protected**:
*   **Community Engagement**: Join volunteer groups, social clubs, or classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **[[exploring_alternative_retirement_living_arrangements | Co-living with Other Retirees]]**: Senior co-housing or shared housing can cut costs and foster friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Utilize Technology for Safety**: Features like Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts can provide protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Scammers often target older adults living alone, so staying informed is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### 6. [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | Health and Long-Term Care Costs]]
Without a spouse, there is no built-in caregiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Healthcare costs accumulate rapidly, and single retirees face higher long-term care expenses than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

**Typical Costs in Canada**:
*   **Home Care**: $25 to $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Assisted Living**: $3,000 to $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Government-Subsidized Nursing Home**: $2,000 to $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Private Care**: $5,000+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Strategies for [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | Planning for Health Costs]]**:
*   **Budget for Care**: Maintain a reserve fund or consider long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Assign Power of Attorney**: Designate a trusted individual to make medical and financial decisions if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Consider Disability and Critical Illness Insurance**: These policies can help cover major medical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Why Planning Matters: A Case Study â€“ Andy Dwire

Let's examine a scenario involving Andy Dwire, a single 65-year-old planning to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

**Andy's Initial Situation**:
*   **Estimated Spending**: $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Assets**: $200,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Estimated Return**: 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Other**: No pension, no spouse, in good health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Initial Plan**: Take CPP and OAS at age 65, aiming for funds to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Mistake #1: Not Accounting for Inflation
Andy's initial $50,000 annual spending plan failed to account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Assuming a 2.1% inflation rate, $50,000 today becomes $55,000 by age 70 and approximately $61,000 by age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This erosion of purchasing power meant his money would run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Correction: Overestimated Spending (a favorable mistake)
Most people overestimate their retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Spending typically drops by about 20% upon retirement and often declines further with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Andy's Revised Spending**: $40,000/year (60s and early 70s), $35,000/year (70s and early 80s), $30,000/year or less (after age 85) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Result**: This change extended Andy's savings to age 85, significantly improving his financial outlook from 54% to 94% of his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. [[assessing_your_current_financial_situation_before_retirement | Accurately estimating retirement costs]] based on lifestyle, health, and inflation is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Correction: Delaying CPP and OAS
Andy initially planned to take CPP and OAS at age 65, receiving approximately $10,000 from CPP and $8,700 from OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Delaying both benefits until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Result**: This increased his CPP to $17,000 and OAS to $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The shortfall now began at age 88 instead of 84, making his plan fully funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This highlights a key strategy for mitigating [[challenges_of_retiring_on_cpp_and_oas_alone | challenges of retiring on CPP and OAS alone]].

### Correction: RRSP Meltdown for Tax Smoothing
Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA (non-taxable) instead of his RRSP (taxable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Smooth out taxes by gradually withdrawing $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This helped cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Result**: His plan reached 102% funding, and his effective tax rate became smoother and very low (2-3%) until age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. There was no shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Building a Buffer
While 102% funded is good, a buffer is ideal for greater comfort in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

**Additional Strategies for Andy**:
*   **Work One Extra Year**: Earning his current salary ($80,000/year) for one more year would increase his funding to 114% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Monetize a Hobby**: Andy's woodworking hobby could conservatively earn him $10,000 per year for about 6 years, leading to 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This is an example of [[tips_for_managing_retirement_budgets | creative income generation]].
*   **Airbnb Condo**: Renting out his condo during summer months (when he stays with family) could generate $10,000 per year for 6 years, also resulting in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Andy preferred the hobby or Airbnb options, as he wanted to avoid working another year, emphasizing the importance of starting retirement sustainably and promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_single_retirees | financial challenges of retiring alone]] in Canada are significant, but with smart planning, it doesn't have to be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Comprehensive planning involves stress-testing the plan for various scenarios, such as market downturns, higher inflation, or long-term care costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. By understanding and addressing risks like higher taxes, lack of survivor benefits, inflation, and healthcare costs, single individuals can stretch their dollars, avoid major tax hits, and achieve a confident retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

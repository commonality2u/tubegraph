In Canada, [[Income splitting strategies for couples | income splitting]] is a method used by couples to balance their combined tax burden by shifting income from a higher-income partner to a lower-income partner, allowing them to take advantage of lower tax brackets and potentially save thousands of dollars [00:03:59 | 00:04:15]. This approach is compared to sharing an umbrella in the rain, where both partners stay drier by balancing the load [00:04:02].

## Understanding Income Splitting

[[Income splitting to reduce tax burden | Income splitting]] aims to reduce the overall household tax bill by ensuring income is taxed at the lowest possible rates. This is achieved by moving taxable income from a high-earning individual to a spouse or partner who is in a lower tax bracket.

## Strategies for Income Splitting

Several strategies can be employed to effectively split income:

### FHSA for Income Splitting
The First Home Savings Account (FHSA), although relatively new, offers a unique opportunity for [[Income splitting strategies for couples | income splitting]] [00:04:17 | 00:04:21].

*   **How it works:** The high-income partner gifts money to the low-income partner, who then contributes it to their FHSA [00:04:32]. This avoids taxable investments and provides a tax deduction for the low-income partner [00:04:35 | 00:04:38].
*   **Effectiveness:** It offers immediate tax savings, tax-free growth within the account, and the flexibility to roll funds into an RRSP if not used for a home purchase [00:04:55 | 00:05:03]. This strategy is most effective when the higher-income partner has already maximized their registered accounts [00:05:05 | 00:05:07].

> [!EXAMPLE] FHSA Income Splitting
> If Jerry gives $8,000 to Elaine, and Elaine contributes it to her FHSA, she receives a $2,400 tax deduction [00:04:41 | 00:04:46]. This results in a total tax saving of $2,532 for the couple, as the investments grow tax-free within the FHSA [00:04:48 | 00:04:54].

### Splitting Pension Income
Shifting pension income to a lower-income spouse helps balance taxable income and reduces household taxes [00:05:09 | 00:05:16].

*   **Eligibility Rules:**
    *   **Before age 65:** Only defined benefit pension plans (DBPPs) qualify [00:05:17 | 00:05:23].
    *   **After age 65:** Defined contribution pension plans (DCPP), Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs), and Life Income Funds (LIFs) also qualify [00:05:26 | 00:05:31].

> [!EXAMPLE] Pension Income Splitting
> If Jerry earns $40,000 from his pension, taxed at 30%, allocating $20,000 to Elaine (taxed at 15%) reduces their household taxes from $12,000 to $9,000, resulting in a $3,000 saving [00:05:33 | 00:05:45].

### Spousal RRSP Contributions
Spousal RRSPs allow the higher-income partner to contribute to the lower-income spouse's account, deferring taxes and balancing retirement income [00:05:49 | 00:05:56]. This falls under [[Retirement income splitting strategies | retirement income splitting strategies]].

> [!EXAMPLE] Spousal RRSP Contribution
> If Jerry contributes $12,000 to Elaine's RRSP, it reduces his taxable income by $4,200 [00:05:58 | 00:06:03]. When Elaine withdraws the funds at a 20% tax rate, the couple saves $1,800 in total [00:06:05 | 00:06:09].

> [!TIP] Attribution Rules
> Avoid early withdrawals within three years of contribution to prevent the income from being attributed back to the contributing spouse [00:06:11 | 00:06:16].

### CPP Income Splitting
Couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can split up to 50% of their benefits, thereby lowering their overall tax bill [00:06:18 | 00:06:23].

> [!EXAMPLE] CPP Income Splitting
> Jerry shifting $3,000 of his CPP income to Elaine can save $450 in taxes by utilizing her lower tax bracket [00:06:25 | 00:06:34].

### Splitting Capital Losses
This strategy involves offsetting one spouse's capital gains with the other's capital losses, adhering to superficial loss rules [00:06:36 | 00:06:41].

> [!EXAMPLE] Splitting Capital Losses
> If Jerry has a $4,000 capital loss early in the year from selling stock, it can offset Elaine's $15,000 capital gain, saving $800 in taxes [00:06:44 | 00:06:52].

> [!TIP] CRA Compliance
> This strategy only applies to non-registered accounts and must comply with CRA rules regarding timing and holding periods [00:06:53 | 00:07:01].

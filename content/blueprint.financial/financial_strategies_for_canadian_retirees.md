Many [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | Canadian retirees]] can reduce their tax burden by effectively managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common error involves inefficient handling of RSP withdrawals, leading to missed opportunities for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. By implementing a specific RSP to Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) strategy, retirees can reduce taxes, enhance tax-free growth, and potentially enjoy a more financially secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue for many retirees is underutilizing their TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Statistics reveal that out of 17.77% Canadians holding a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This indicates that most Canadians are not capitalizing on the TFSA's tax-free growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with substantial unused TFSA contribution room, often tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For instance, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60 to 64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, peaking at 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This surge in TFSA maximization at later ages is directly related to the RSP to TFSA strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are effective for saving during working years, but their withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially pushing retirees into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Upon reaching age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates that RSPs be converted into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs), necessitating minimum withdrawals regardless of the retiree's financial need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

If retirees have excess funds from mandatory RRIF withdrawals that they don't immediately need for living expenses, they can deposit these funds into their TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This approach can lead to substantial long-term tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires Eddie to withdraw $30,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Since Eddie is in a 30% tax bracket, $9,000 of this withdrawal goes to taxes, leaving him with $21,000 after-tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 for his living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead of placing this in a regular savings or taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Assuming an average annual return of 6%, here's how Eddie's TFSA grows:
*   **Year 1:** $10,000 contribution grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie adds another $10,000 annually, benefiting from compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, which has grown to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

#### Comparison: TFSA vs. Non-Registered Account

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, assuming a 6% annual growth rate but with 30% of gains lost to taxes (resulting in an effective 4% growth rate after taxes), his account would only grow to approximately $120,000 after 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. If placed in a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the growth would be significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

By contributing all his excess income to his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. His TFSA balance reaches $132,000, compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, and potentially closer to $55,000 if placed in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This strategy not only maximizes Eddie's [[strategies_for_sustainable_retirement_savings | retirement savings]] but also provides flexibility for future needs or continued tax-free compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Pro Tips

*   **Prioritize TFSA:** Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This ensures your money grows tax-free, preventing a portion of your gains from being lost to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Strategic RSP Withdrawals:** Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Does This Eliminate RSP Taxes on Withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. RSP withdrawals remain taxable income subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The goal is to minimize the tax impact while maximizing your overall [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

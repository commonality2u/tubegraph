The CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB) is a valuable way for Canadians to boost their retirement income if they continue working after beginning to receive their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Ignoring this benefit is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## What is the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB)?

The PRB provides additional CPP payments based on continued earnings and contributions after you've started receiving your regular [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. These contributions can lead to a meaningful increase in your overall [[relying_too_heavily_on_cpp_for_retirement_income | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## How the PRB Works

If you are under 70 and continue working after starting to receive your [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP benefits]], both you and your employer will still contribute to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. For example, if you are 67 and earning close to the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | maximum CPP earning limit]], these additional contributions could increase your [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP income]] by up to $44.46 per month starting the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Benefits of the PRB

While the monthly amounts from the PRB might seem small initially, they accumulate over time and offer significant advantages:
*   **For Life and Inflation-Indexed** These additional payments are received for life and are indexed to inflation, meaning they will grow over time and preserve your purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Significant Long-Term Boost** Over several years, PRB increases can significantly boost your [[relying_too_ heavily_on_cpp_for_retirement_income | retirement income]], helping you maintain your lifestyle or cover unexpected expenses as you age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

It is an easy and effective way to enhance your financial security in [[relying_too_heavily_on_cpp_for_retirement_income | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

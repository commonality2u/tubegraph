The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP) Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB) is a valuable way to boost your income if you continue working after you start receiving [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Many Canadians overlook this benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## How it Works
The PRB provides additional [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] payments based on your continued earnings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. If you are under 70 and still working, both you and your employer continue contributing to [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Benefit Increase
If you earn close to the maximum [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] earning limit, these additional contributions could increase your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] income by up to $44.46 per month starting the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Long-Term Value
While the monthly amounts may seem small initially, these PRB increases are for life and are indexed to inflation, meaning they will grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Over several years, these increases can accumulate into a significant boost in your retirement income, helping to maintain your lifestyle or cover unexpected expenses as you age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Importance
Ignoring the PRB means missing out on this extra income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you plan to continue working after starting to receive [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]], utilizing the PRB is an easy and effective way to enhance your financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

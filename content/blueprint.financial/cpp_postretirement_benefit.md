The CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB) is a valuable way to boost your income if you continue working after you start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Many Canadians overlook this benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## How it Works
The PRB provides additional CPP payments based on your continued earnings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For instance, if you are 67 and still working, you and your employer will continue contributing to CPP as long as you are under 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. If your earnings are close to the maximum CPP earning limit, these additional contributions could increase your CPP income by up to $44.46 per month starting the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Benefits of the PRB
While the monthly amounts may seem small initially, these increases are for life and are indexed to inflation, meaning they will grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Over several years, these PRB increases can add up to a significant boost in your [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement income]], helping you maintain your lifestyle or cover unexpected expenses as you age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Ignoring the PRB means missing out on this extra income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If you plan to keep working after receiving CPP, the PRB is an easy and effective way to enhance your financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

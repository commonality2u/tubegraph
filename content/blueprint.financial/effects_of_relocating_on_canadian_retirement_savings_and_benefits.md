A significant number of Canadians are opting to permanently leave the country, with 106,000 departing in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are seeking an escape from high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article explores why Canadians are choosing to [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_retiring_abroad_for_canadians | retire abroad]] and the [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | financial implications]] of such a move.

## The High Cost of Retirement in Canada

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount may not be sufficient in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For example, a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto averages about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With additional costs like $200 for utilities, $400 for groceries, and a $150 transit pass, monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000 for modest living without home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. CPP and OAS benefits barely cover a third of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, leading many Canadians to delay retirement or seek alternative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto, he spends about $50,000 a year, relying on $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, with the remainder drawn from his RRSP and TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Financial Shortfall in Canada
> By age 70, Seth drains his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals of over $46,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Effective [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | tax rates]] creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. By age 74, he is out of savings, and by age 76, his net worth is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This scenario demonstrates how quickly a nest egg can unravel in a high-cost city like Toronto, even with modest spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Retiring Abroad: Stretching Savings Further

Some Canadians are choosing to [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_retiring_abroad_for_canadians | retire abroad]] to make their money stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Using tools like Numbeo helps assess living costs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Popular Destinations and Their Financial Impact

#### Mexico (Cancun)
Mexico is a top choice for Canadians seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. It offers year-round sunshine and mild weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Private clinics are modern, affordable, and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners, making private insurance essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa requires about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 CAD per month, totaling about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Seth's Retirement in Cancun
> If Seth retired in Cancun with the same savings, his CPP and OAS would cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This allows his portfolio to grow: he would have $387,000 at age 70, $586,000 at 80, and over $900,000 by 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This highlights the "potential power of location" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

#### Portugal (Porto)
For those preferring a European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and a relatively affordable cost of living for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Healthcare is excellent, and residents can access the public system; private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring about â‚¬870 per month (approximately $1,400 CAD) in steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses totaling $1,700, leading to about $3,000 per month or $36,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Seth's Retirement in Portugal
> In Porto, with $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annual CPP/OAS, Seth would draw down his TFSA and then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.# Effects of Relocating on Canadian Retirement Savings and Benefits

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with $281,000 in net worth after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto, he spends about $50,000 a year, relying on a mix of CPP and OAS (about $18,000 annually), with the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

By age 74, he's out of savings, and by age 76, his net worth turns negative, a nightmare scenario for any retiree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This simplified example shows how quickly a decent nest egg can unravel in a high-cost city like Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Retiring Abroad: Stretching Savings Further

Some Canadians are deciding to leave Canada altogether for a better shot at retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They move to places where their money stretches further, allowing $1,300 a month to mean living decently instead of just scraping by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Using Numbeo can provide a rough idea of living costs around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Popular Destinations and Their Financial Impact

#### Mexico (Cancun)
Mexico is a top pick for Canadian retirees, offering year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Private clinics are modern, affordable, and fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Private insurance is essential as public healthcare isn't usually available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is well-suited for retirees and requires about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 Canadian per month all-in, which is about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Seth's Retirement in Cancun
> If Seth moved to Cancun, with much lower living costs, CPP and OAS would cover most expenses, and he'd only make small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This results in his portfolio growing: he would have $387,000 at 70, $586,000 at 80, and over $900,000 by 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This simple move demonstrates the "potential power of location" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

#### Portugal (Porto)
Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and a relatively affordable cost of living for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Winters are mild, and summers are sunny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Healthcare is excellent, and once a resident, one can access the public system; private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, designed for those with steady income, requiring about â‚¬870 per month (about $1,400 CAD) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses around $1,700, totaling about $3,000 a month, similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Seth's Retirement in Portugal
> If Seth chose Porto, spending $36,000 a year, with $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, he would first draw from his TFSA, then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. His savings would drop to $199,000 by age 75, just over $100,000 by 80, and be empty by 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. While this provides a better runway than Toronto, it's still not enough for a long retirement, especially given people are living longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
>
> **Small Adjustments, Big Impact**: If Seth delayed CPP to age 70 and melted down his RRSP from 65 to 69 to cover the gap, he would lower taxes early and let CPP grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This one move alone could extend his savings by another two years, running out at around age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This demonstrates how [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | smart planning]] can make "close" turn into "comfortable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

#### Thailand
Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians, offering diverse environments from cooler mountains to beaches and city energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Healthcare is modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: To qualify for a retirement visa, one needs to be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (about $33,000 Canadian) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can run $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For someone like Seth, who receives $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this could be a perfect fit, covering basic needs and allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

#### Paraguay
Paraguay is gaining interest due to its low costs and favorable [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Tax System**: Paraguay operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions is not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In AsunciÃ³n, living expenses are about $628 per month, with rent for a one-bedroom around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, meaning one can live well on just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Paraguay offers ways to obtain a permanent residency visa with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This could be a financial sweet spot for Seth due to its very low cost, tax efficiency, and simple long-term settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

#### Spain (Alicante)
Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Healthcare is excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,057, with rent for a one-bedroom in the city center at about $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This brings total monthly expenses to around $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, similar to parts of Canada but potentially cheaper than some parts of Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, which requires about $40,000 to $45,000 Canadian a year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is a higher bar, but doable with planning (e.g., earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Spain offers a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS Rule]] for Living Abroad
Many Canadians don't realize they could lose their OAS payments if they retire abroad without meeting a key rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you only need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   However, if you are living outside Canada, you need 20 years of residency to keep receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only get OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you're in a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] David's OAS
> David, at 67, has 15 years of Canadian residency and starts collecting OAS in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. He then retires to Thailand. Six months later, his OAS stops because Thailand doesn't have a social security agreement with Canada, and David didn't hit the 20-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Even though he qualified while in Canada, he loses the benefit abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to know the [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | rules before you move]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### General Advice
*   **Research Costs**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs like rent, food, and utilities in your target country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Don't Rely Solely on Government Benefits**: Do not count on just CPP and OAS alone. Inflation, currency shifts, or healthcare surprises can throw off your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared for Challenges**: Life abroad isn't for everyone. Distance from family, new systems, and language barriers can be extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

A low-cost retirement can be amazing, but only if it's backed by a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Where you live can transform your retirement, but it also comes with [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax rules]] and big financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

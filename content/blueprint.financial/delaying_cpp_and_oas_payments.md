Delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) payments can be a highly effective strategy to optimize your retirement income and potentially avoid the OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The OAS clawback is triggered when your income exceeds a certain threshold, which for 2024 is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

## Delaying CPP Payments

One of the most effective [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | strategies]] to reduce the OAS clawback is to delay your CPP payments until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

### [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_payments | Benefits of Delaying CPP]]

*   **Increased Payments**: Delaying CPP can increase your monthly payments by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For instance, if you're eligible for $1,000 per month at age 65, delaying until age 70 could boost your monthly payments to $1,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. These higher payments continue to grow in value for the rest of your life as CPP is indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced Taxable Income**: Delaying CPP lowers your taxable income between the ages of 65 and 70, which is typically when the OAS clawback becomes a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Example: Peter Parker and Delayed CPP

Consider Peter Parker, who at age 65, faces an OAS clawback of $811 due to a high taxable income from drawing both CPP and other retirement sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. By choosing to delay CPP, Peter's taxable income is reduced, leading to a smaller OAS clawback of $584 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This represents a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback just by delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. In addition, he secures higher CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

## Delaying OAS Payments

Another smart strategy is to consider delaying your OAS payments up to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits | Advantages of Delaying OAS]]

*   **Increased Payments**: Delaying OAS increases your monthly payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. For example, if you receive $500 per month at age 65, delaying until age 70 increases your monthly payments to $680 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This provides a significant boost to your retirement income, especially when combined with delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced or Eliminated Clawback**: Delaying OAS can reduce or even eliminate the clawback during earlier retirement years when your income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Example: Peter Parker and Delayed OAS

Peter Parker, again, faces an OAS clawback of $811 at age 65 due to high taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. By delaying OAS until age 70, the entire clawback is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This strategy allows him to avoid losing benefits and receive a higher monthly OAS payment (a 36% increase over receiving it at 65) after age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Delaying

> [!CAUTION]
> It is not always wise to delay CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. If you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy, delaying may not be the most beneficial option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. The decision should be based on your specific scenario, especially if you have higher income between ages 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Individualized planning is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

In short, [[strategies_for_maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delaying your CPP]] and OAS until age 70 can provide a dual benefit: potentially avoiding some or all of the clawback entirely, and receiving higher payments later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

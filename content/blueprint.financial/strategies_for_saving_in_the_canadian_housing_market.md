Saving a substantial down payment for a home in Canada, especially with its high home prices, can seem daunting. However, by leveraging tax-advantaged accounts like the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) through the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), it's possible to reach significant savings goals, potentially even $200,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_to_save_for_a_home | strategies for combining these tools]] to maximize your savings for a dream home.

## The First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a valuable new tool for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Contribution Limits and Tax Benefits
*   You can contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   The lifetime maximum contribution limit is $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Contributions are tax deductible, similar to an RSP, providing a tax break annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   [[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada | Qualifying withdrawals]] for a home purchase are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Every dollar saved goes directly towards your future home without repayment obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Spousal Contributions
If buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, you can double your savings by combining both FHSAs to reach a total of $80,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> If a spouse or someone else with higher income contributes to your FHSA, the contribution is treated as if you, the FHSA holder, made it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means the tax benefits, such as deductions and tax-free growth, apply to you, not the contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The person contributing has no tax obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Growth Potential of the FHSA
The FHSA offers significant growth potential over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Example 1 (Individual):** Contributing the maximum $8,000 annually for 5 years reaches the $40,000 lifetime limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Assuming a 6% annual return, this could grow to approximately $45,000 in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. If left untouched for another 10 years at the same 6% rate, it could grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling the original contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This growth is entirely tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

The RSP is a long-standing tool for [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | retirement savings]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Contribution Limits and Home Buyers' Plan
*   You can contribute up to 18% of your income annually, with a maximum of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   Through the HBP, you can withdraw up to $60,000 from your RSP tax-free for a first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   If buying with a spouse, this withdrawal limit doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Repayment Requirements
Unlike the FHSA, the HBP requires repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. You must repay the HBP amount over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Missing a repayment means that amount is added to your taxable income for the year, increasing your tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Combining FHSA and RSP/HBP for a Down Payment

By combining the FHSA and HBP, individuals and couples can significantly boost their down payment savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Example: Ross and Rachel
Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home, illustrate this strategy:
*   **FHSA Contribution:** They each max out their FHSA, contributing $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, totaling $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **RSP/HBP Withdrawal:** They each withdraw $60,000 from their RSPs through the HBP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Total Savings:** By combining these, Ross and Rachel have $200,000 saved for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This not only secures their home but also maximizes tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Potential for Higher Savings with Growth
With growth, the combined potential is even greater:
*   If Ross and Rachel both contribute the maximum $8,000 annually to their FHSAs for 5 years, saving $80,000 combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   With a 6% return over the next 10 years, their combined FHSA balance could grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Adding $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals ($60,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, they could have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Even without a partner, an individual can save up to $100,000 using this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Canadian Housing Market Reality Check

The Canadian housing market presents a significant challenge for first-time home buyers due to skyrocketing prices, especially in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Regional Price Differences
A $200,000 down payment's impact varies significantly by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:
*   In cities like Montreal and Calgary, where prices are more affordable, $200,000 can cover about 32% of the total home cost, providing a substantial advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   In higher-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the same $200,000 covers only 16-19%, requiring buyers to take on much larger mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

These comparisons highlight the critical importance of using tax-free savings tools like the FHSA and HBP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. For expensive cities, every bit of savings helps offset the mortgage burden, while in more affordable areas, a larger down payment can ease market entry and secure better mortgage terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Tax Advantages of FHSA and RSP in Saving

The tax advantages of accounts like the FHSA and RSP make a massive difference in the actual amount you need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **Without Tax Benefits:** To save $200,000 without tax-free accounts, you must account for income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For example, with a 30% tax rate, you'd need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 left after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This means saving an additional $85,000 to reach your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **With FHSA and RSP:** When using these accounts, your contributions are tax-deductible, meaning you don't pay taxes on that income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This allows you to save the full $200,000 without paying a penny in taxes on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Every dollar contributed goes directly towards your home purchase, drastically reducing the overall amount you need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> According to a real estate agent, the new FHSA and the increased $60,000 limit for the RSP's Home Buyers' Plan are highly exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. When couples learn how to combine these, home ownership can become achievable much faster, turning what seemed impossible into a real opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Using these financial tools together creates a clear and faster path to owning your dream home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

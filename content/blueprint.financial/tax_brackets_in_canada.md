When an individual receives a raise, such as moving from an annual salary of $55,000 to $60,000, they may enter the next federal tax bracket in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift can mean moving from a 15% tax rate to 20.5% for a portion of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Common Misconception

A frequent mistake among Canadians is the belief that their entire salary becomes taxed at the higher rate, such as 20.5%, once they enter a new bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This misunderstanding can lead to the feeling that earning more money results in a net loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

However, this is not how the [[canadian_tax_structure | Canadian tax system]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## How Tax Brackets Work

The [[understanding_tax_brackets | Canadian tax system]] uses a progressive structure:
*   Only the portion of income that falls into a higher bracket is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   For example, the first $57,375 of income remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the amount exceeding that threshold, such as an additional $2,625 in the case of a raise to $60,000, is taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The preceding income remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Effective Tax Rate

This means an individual's average or effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest bracket they enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Consequently, even when entering a higher tax bracket, individuals still take home more money, confirming that increased income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Tax misconceptions should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

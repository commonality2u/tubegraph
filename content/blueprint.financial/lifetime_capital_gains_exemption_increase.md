The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) is a tax provision in Canada that allows individuals to shield a portion of their capital gains from taxation, particularly when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:05">[06:18:05]</a>.

## Key Changes in 2025

For 2025, the LCGE limit has increased to $1.25 million, up from approximately $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:09">[06:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:47">[06:11:47]</a>.

## How it Works

If an individual sells a qualified small business for $1.25 million in 2025, they could potentially exempt the entire capital gain from their individual tax, depending on their remaining LCGE limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:43">[06:24:43]</a>. This exemption is available to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:28">[06:38:28]</a>. Therefore, if multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their portion of the gains, which can significantly reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:20">[06:41:20]</a>.

The LCGE does not affect sole proprietors or self-employed individuals, who remain taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. It is strictly for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## LCGE vs. Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)

For many business owners, the LCGE remains a more effective tool than the Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI) because it offers a complete exemption for eligible capital gains, especially when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. By strategically allocating gains across shareholders, the benefits of the LCGE can be maximized, reducing tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

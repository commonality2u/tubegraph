This article provides a deep dive into Canadian household net worth data, focusing on how net worth evolves across different age groups and other demographic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overall Canadian Net Worth Trends

Canadian household net worth increased steadily from 2020 to 2024, rising from approximately $762,000 to over $1 million by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This growth was primarily driven by gains in real estate and financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A slight dip occurred in 2023, bringing net worth down to about $979,000, likely due to inflation and post-pandemic spending, but it recovered to over $1 million by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Impact of Real Estate on Net Worth

Real estate plays a significant role in Canadian wealth, making up over 50% of household net worth between 2020 and 2024, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This reliance on property underscores its importance in wealth building and storage for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The increase from $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million in 2024 was largely driven by real estate, despite rising liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

However, heavy reliance on real estate means that a downturn in the housing market could significantly impact households, potentially wiping out a large portion of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Diversify your portfolio beyond real estate. Spreading investments across real estate, stocks, bonds, and other assets can protect against potential downturns in volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Homeowners vs. Renters: A Growing Wealth Gap

There is a striking wealth gap between homeowners and renters in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. In 2024, homeowners had an average net worth of $1.38 million, nearly five times higher than renters, who averaged $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Both groups experienced growth from 2020 to 2024, with homeowners seeing a 33% increase and renters a 31% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The primary driver of this disparity is real estate appreciation, which significantly boosts homeowners' net worth, while renters primarily rely on financial assets for wealth building due to their limited exposure to real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Average Net Worth by Age Group

Net worth progresses through different stages of life, reflecting typical financial journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Here's how net worth evolved by age group in Canada from 2020 to 2024:

### Under 35 Years

In the early career phase, net worth is generally lower as individuals build assets and manage debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Canadians under 35 saw their net worth grow from $231,000 in 2020 to $338,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Financial volatility is common in this group due to factors like student loans and early career challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### 35 to 44 Years

As individuals enter their 30s and 40s, net worth typically grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. By 2024, the average net worth for this group reached $658,000, up from $490,000 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This is a key stage for investing in assets like real estate and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 45 to 54 Years & 55 to 64 Years

Net worth peaks in these two age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In 2024, those aged 45 to 54 had $1.35 million in net worth, and 55 to 64-year-olds reached $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This growth is largely driven by real estate and retirement savings, marking this as the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### 65 Years and Older (De-accumulation Phase)

In retirement, net worth tends to plateau or grow modestly as people begin drawing down assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For those over 65, net worth rose from $863,000 in 2020 to $1.12 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, it does drop from the previous age groups, indicating the de-accumulation of assets for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## [[net_worth_differences_by_household_type_in_canada | Net Worth Differences by Household Type]]

When comparing one-person and multi-person households, a clear wealth gap exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By 2024, multi-person households had nearly double the net worth of one-person households ($1.17 million versus $634,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This difference is mainly due to multi-person households having larger total assets ($1.4 million versus $74,000), which makes sense with two income providers and shared expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Despite starting with less, one-person households are closing the gap in terms of growth, with their net worth increasing by 40% from 2020 to 2024, compared to 29.4% for multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Real estate remains a major factor for both groups, accounting for 55% of net worth for multi-person households and 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This suggests that multi-person households may be better able to afford property, while one-person households might be priced out of the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | Understanding Net Worth Classes in Canada]]: The Top 1%

According to a 2021 report from the PBO, the threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This group includes around 160,000 families in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The report highlights how wealth is increasingly concentrated among this small percentage, with the top 1% holding nearly 24.8% of the total net wealth in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Median Versus Average Net Worth

If average net worth numbers seem discouraging, understanding the difference between median and average can provide a clearer picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The median is a better measure as it represents the middle point, with half of households having more and half having less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The average, however, is skewed by the ultra-wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

For example, in 2019, the median net worth for multi-person households was $514,000, while the average in 2020 was $907,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This average is significantly distorted by individuals with extremely high net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Although Statistics Canada stopped reporting median net worth after 2019, it's estimated that the typical household's net worth is likely around 50% lower than the average today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Using the median as a benchmark offers a more realistic and accurate picture of financial standing for most Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Net Worth by Income Level

Net worth data by income level confirms that higher earnings generally lead to higher net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. In 2024, the top 20% of income earners had a net worth of over $2.29 million, more than six times that of the bottom 20%, who were at $375,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The top group gained almost $460,000 in just four years, further widening the wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

However, middle-income households (those in the 41% to 80% group) saw the fastest percentage growth, quietly building wealth from rising real estate and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This indicates that one does not necessarily have to be in the top 20% of income earners to significantly grow their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Lower-income households experienced modest gains but still face challenges in accessing high-growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Comparing Net Worth Internationally

International net worth data from the UBS Global Wealth Data Book provides a snapshot of Canada's global standing (data in US dollars and based on different reporting standards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>:

*   Canada's average net worth sits between that of the UK and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Switzerland stands out with an average net worth of $685,000 USD, 85% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The US average is 49% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Germany's average is 31% lower than Canada's, and China's average is almost 80% lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   Australia's median net worth is 80% higher than Canadians', and its average net worth is 34% higher, likely propped up by its massive housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## How to Use Net Worth Data to Increase Your Own Net Worth

Net worth data is a valuable tool for setting realistic financial goals and building wealth strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

1.  **Set Realistic Goals**: Use net worth data to understand your current standing and set achievable targets. For example, if the average for your age group is $400,000, aim to gradually surpass that benchmark with specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize Investing**: Wealthy households grow their net worth through investing, not just by earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Evaluate your assets to ensure you are investing sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
3.  **Optimize Financial Assets**: Focus on optimizing financial assets through vehicles like the RRSP, TFSA, and other investment accounts, which are key drivers of long-term wealth accumulation for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
4.  **Leverage Real Estate**: Real estate plays a significant role in Canadian wealth building, with over 50% of the average Canadian's wealth coming from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If homeownership is a goal, work towards it, or consider how to leverage property you already own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Benchmark and Track Progress**: Utilize strategies employed by top earners, such as minimizing debt and diversifying investments, to guide your [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | financial plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Regularly track and adjust your strategy to stay on course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Remember, "comparison is the thief of joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Focus on your unique financial journey and celebrate your own progress rather than comparing yourself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Building your net worth is not just about earning more; it's about having the proper strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

Despite various downsides, [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] remain a significant investment vehicle in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This popularity is heavily influenced by the marketing and distribution strategies employed by banks and financial institutions.

## Tricky Marketing Tactics

Banks and financial institutions often use misleading marketing tactics to promote mutual funds, creating an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Selective Reporting

Financial institutions highlight only the success stories among mutual funds, showcasing top-performing funds in their advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. They conveniently omit the many other funds that underperformed, were closed, or merged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This tactic leads investors to believe in an overall high performance that does not reflect the full reality of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Survivorship Bias

A key concept in understanding how mutual funds can mislead investors is **survivorship bias** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This bias occurs when only the surviving funds are included in performance reports, while poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This creates a misleadingly positive picture of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

For instance:
*   Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   On average across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   For Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Banks and financial institutions leverage survivorship bias to their advantage, showcasing only the top performers and creating an illusion of consistent high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Why Mutual Funds Are Popular: Aggressive Distribution Channels

Despite concerns such as [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | high fees]] and [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | low returns]], mutual funds remain popular due to their aggressive distribution channels and perceived benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Accessibility and Convenience

[[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | Mutual funds]] are highly accessible and convenient for the average investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. They offer a straightforward way to diversify across various asset classes without requiring extensive market knowledge or large amounts of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. With banks on nearly every corner in Canada, financial advisors make it easy for customers to buy mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Aggressive Sales Targets and Profitability

Banks and financial advisors frequently push mutual funds due to aggressive sales targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This leads many Canadians to invest in them over more cost-effective options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | Mutual funds]] are considered a very high-profit product for banks, incentivizing them to promote these products to customers opening accounts or seeking other services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Perceived Professional Management

Many investors are drawn to mutual funds because they are managed by professional portfolio managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. These managers are seen as experts capable of making informed investment decisions, appealing to those who prefer a more hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Despite data indicating otherwise, people believe in the expertise of these fund managers, hoping for high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Financial advisors are adept at reinforcing this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Marketing tools like Morningstar's five-star ratings can further mislead investors into believing they will achieve better performance with certain funds, even though many studies show these funds tend to underperform in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

This marketing, combined with the trust and reputation of large financial institutions, convinces many investors to choose mutual funds over other alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

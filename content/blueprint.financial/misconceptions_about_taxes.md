A common [[misconceptions_about_tax_brackets | misconception about tax brackets]] is that receiving a raise that pushes an individual into a higher tax bracket will result in less take-home pay overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For example, an individual earning $56,000 might believe that a raise to $60,000 would be detrimental because it crosses the $57,375 threshold for a 20.5% federal tax bracket, up from their current 15% bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Canada's Progressive Tax System

Canadian taxes operate under a progressive tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates. Only the income earned *above* a specific threshold is taxed at the higher rate associated with the new bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. All income earned below that threshold continues to be taxed at the lower, previous rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Example

Consider the scenario where an individual moves from a 15% federal tax bracket to a 20.5% bracket after their income surpasses $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. If their salary increases from $56,000 to $60,000:
*   The first $57,375 of their income is still taxed at the lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Only the portion of income *above* $57,375 (i.e., $60,000 - $57,375 = $2,625) is taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Due to the progressive nature of the tax system, it is always [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | beneficial to receive a raise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea that a raise could lead to less take-home pay is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

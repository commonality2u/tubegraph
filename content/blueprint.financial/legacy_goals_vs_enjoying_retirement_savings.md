Many retirees find themselves in a unique [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save or spend dilemma]] once they reach their golden years. After decades of saving and investing, the mindset shift from accumulation to distribution can be uncomfortable, leading to hesitation in spending what they've worked so hard to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This struggle to move from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset is common among retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A significant factor contributing to this hesitation, alongside other concerns like longevity risk and market fluctuations, is the desire to achieve [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## The Push and Pull: Legacy vs. Lifestyle

For many, leaving a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes is a significant priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Being cautious with spending can certainly help achieve these [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. However, this caution can also lead to missed opportunities and experiences that make retirement fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Potential Downsides of Excessive Caution

While not spending all your money can offer [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | financial security]], an overly cautious approach, often driven by [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]], can have drawbacks:
*   **Missed Experiences** Retirees who hesitate to spend might miss out on meaningful experiences like travel, hobbies, or healthcare improvements that could enhance their golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Healthspan vs. Lifespan** Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of your [[impact_of_healthspan_vs_lifespan_in_retirement_planning | healthspan]]. This refers to the number of years lived in good health, active, and free from chronic disease or disability, as opposed to just lifespan (total years lived) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Retirees might wait until their physical abilities decline, limiting their enjoyment of what they saved for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Inflation's Impact** Inflation can erode the value of money over time if a retirement plan is not properly structured to account for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Benefits of Cautious Spending (Including Legacy)

Despite the potential downsides, a degree of caution is beneficial and aligns with certain [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | goals]]:
*   **Encourages Thoughtful Spending** Hesitation can promote deliberate spending, ensuring each decision is well-considered rather than impulsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Money Lasts Longer** A careful approach helps money stretch further, reducing the risk of running out prematurely, also known as reducing longevity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk** Cautious spending helps protect against "sequence of returns risk," where market losses early in retirement can significantly deplete a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Aligns with Legacy Goals** For many, a primary goal is to leave a substantial amount for their loved ones or charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Cautious spending allows retirees to achieve these [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]] while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Finding the Balance with a Financial Plan

The key to resolving the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save versus spend dilemma]] is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. A common problem is that retirees simply don't know how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Without this clarity, it's natural to err on the side of caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

A well-structured financial plan is essential. By clearly outlining affordable spending levels and stress-testing the investment portfolio, retirees can move from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Case Study: Balancing Spending and Legacy Goals

Robert (70) and Susan (68) exemplify clients seeking to balance spending with [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

*   **Client Profile**
    *   **Combined Income:** Approximately $100,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   **Annual Expenses:** $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Savings:** $1.2 million diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   **Goal:** To leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

*   **Process**
    Robert and Susan were cautious with their spending, primarily aiming to leave a significant inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Despite their healthy income and savings, they were hesitant to increase spending, unsure if they could afford more travel and leisure without jeopardizing their [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. A financial review determined their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide an additional $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover expenses and increase discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

*   **Solution**
    To balance their lifestyle and [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | legacy goals]], the recommendation was to slightly increase their spending from $75,000 to $85,000 per year. This allowed for more funds towards travel and experiences while keeping their inheritance goal intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The portfolio was stress-tested for market downturns, confirming that even in adverse conditions, they could maintain their spending without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **Outcome**
    With this new plan, Robert and Susan gained confidence to enjoy a higher quality of life now, while still leaving a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach helped them strike the right balance between enjoying their retirement and achieving their long-term [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### The "Guilt" of Spending

It's common for clients, especially those who have built substantial portfolios, to struggle with spending more money due to deeply ingrained saving habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Even individuals with ample savings, like the speaker's own parents, can feel guilty spending on themselves in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

To overcome this, easing into spending by setting small, meaningful goals, such as little trips or new hobbies, can help gradually shift the mindset and enhance retirement enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Don't let fear hold you back from enjoying your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

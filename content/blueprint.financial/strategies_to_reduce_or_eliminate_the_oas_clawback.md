The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is a Canadian government payment that can reach up to $948 annually per recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, this amount can be significantly reduced or entirely [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | clawed back]] by the government if an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This reduction is known as the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] or recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Understanding the OAS Clawback Threshold
The [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | OAS clawback threshold]] for the 2024 income year is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A 15% recovery tax is applied to income exceeding this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The full OAS benefit is eliminated if income reaches or exceeds:
*   $153,700 annually for individuals under age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   $156,016 annually for those age 75 and over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

For example, if a 75-year-old individual's income hits $160,000 in 2024, exceeding the threshold, they would lose all their OAS benefits due to the 15% recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the OAS Clawback
There are several [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | strategies to minimize repayment]] or avoid the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### 1. Delaying CPP Payments
Delaying Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments until a later age (e.g., 68, 69, or 70) is an effective strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Increased Payments**: Delaying CPP can increase your monthly payments by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For instance, a $1,000 monthly CPP payment at age 65 would increase to $1,420 by delaying until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These higher payments are indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Reduced Taxable Income**: It lowers your taxable income between ages 65 and 70, the period when the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] typically applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This can result in a smaller [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   *Example*: An individual facing an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income might reduce their clawback to $584 by delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, saving over $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. Delaying OAS Payments
Considering delaying your OAS payments up to age 70 can also be a smart strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Increased Payments**: This increases your monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For example, a $500 monthly OAS payment at age 65 would become $680 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Clawback Elimination**: Delaying OAS can reduce or even eliminate the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | clawback]] during earlier retirement years when income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   *Example*: An individual facing an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 could eliminate the entire clawback by delaying OAS until age 70, especially if they have higher income between ages 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Delaying CPP and OAS is not always advisable, especially if you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. It's crucial to plan specifically for your personal scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### 3. Using TFSA Wisely
A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is an excellent tool to avoid the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Withdrawals from a TFSA are completely tax-free and do not count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This allows access to funds for living expenses without increasing taxable income and helps stay below the [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Withdrawing $20,000 annually from a $100,000 TFSA for living expenses would incur no taxes and not count towards taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. In contrast, withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like an RSP could trigger the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> **RSP to TFSA Ladder**: Consider gradually withdrawing from your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and contributing to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This strategy keeps taxable income lower later on and enables tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement, minimizing the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting
Pension income splitting can significantly reduce taxable income and help avoid the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]], particularly if one spouse earns significantly less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Transferring Income**: You can transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This keeps the higher-income spouse's taxable income below the [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If one spouse earns $60,000 annually from a pension and the other earns less, transferring $30,000 reduces the higher earner's taxable income to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This places them in a lower tax bracket and reduces the risk of the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]], while the couple pays less tax overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### 5. Managing RIF Withdrawals
When an RSP converts to a Registered Income Fund (RIF) at age 71, minimum annual withdrawals become mandatory and are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. These withdrawals can push income over the [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Using Younger Spouse's Age**: You can minimize this impact by using a younger spouse's age to reduce the required RIF withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A 71-year-old with a 65-year-old spouse can base their RIF withdrawal rate on the spouse's age. Instead of a 5.28% withdrawal rate, it drops to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. For a $200,000 RIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering taxable income by $2,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Tapping Non-Taxable Accounts**: Prioritizing withdrawals from non-taxable accounts like a TFSA first (as mentioned above) can also help manage RIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### 6. Investing Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts
The type of income generated from non-registered accounts can significantly impact taxable income and potentially trigger the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Taxable Income Types**:
    *   **Interest Income**: Fully taxable at your marginal rate (e.g., from bonds, GICs, savings accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    *   **Dividend Income**: Taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Capital Gains**: Only 50% is taxed, making them a more tax-efficient option if kept under the $250,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Focus on Growth Investments**: By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, you can reduce your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    *   *Example*: $10,000 in interest income is fully taxed, but $10,000 in capital gains results in only $5,000 being taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Being mindful of what counts towards your income is crucial to avoid exceeding the [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### 7. Capturing Capital Gains Before Age 65
Timing capital gains is key to avoiding the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Realize Gains Earlier**: By capturing gains before you turn 65, you can avoid large taxable events once OAS benefits begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Capital gains can still push income over the threshold, even though they are taxed favorably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic Timing**: A smart approach is to realize these gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This allows you to pay taxes earlier and prevents increasing your taxable income during the crucial retirement years when OAS begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Selling property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain doesn't count towards taxable income during the years OAS begins, helping to stay under the [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning
Awareness of [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | strategies like delaying CPP and OAS]], [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | using your TFSA]], and [[investment_strategies_and_managing_withdrawals_to_maintain_oas_benefits_in_retirement | managing RIF withdrawals]] can help avoid the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] and preserve more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. These strategic moves can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Complex cases, such as those involving retirement properties or businesses, may require professional assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

[[Impact of inflation on retiree purchasing power | Inflation]] is described as the "silent wealth killer" because it quietly erodes an individual's [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | purchasing power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For single retirees, the impact of [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | rising costs]] for necessities like groceries, housing, or healthcare is magnified as there is no partner with whom to share the burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Therefore, planning for [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | inflation]] is considered absolutely necessary to ensure money goes further, especially during a retirement that could last 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Strategies to Combat [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | Inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>

Retirees are employing various creative strategies to fight back against the [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | impact of inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>:

*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space** Many retirees are downsizing their homes or renting out spare rooms to unlock equity and reduce living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Co-living or House Hacking** Exploring options like co-living with friends or house hacking can help cut fixed expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocation** A growing number of retirees are moving to lower-cost provinces or even other countries to stretch their retirement dollars further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire and [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | Inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single retiree planning to retire, initially underestimated the impact of [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | inflation]] on his finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### The Mistake: Not Accounting for [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | Inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

Andy initially planned to spend $50,000 per year in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. However, he overlooked the effect of [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario** Assuming a 2.1% [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | inflation]] rate:
    *   His $50,000 annual spending would become approximately $55,000 by age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   By age 75, the equivalent spending would be around $61,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

This meant his actual [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | purchasing power]] would decrease annually, causing his money to run out much earlier than anticipated, specifically around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Correcting Course: Adjusting Spending Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>

Andy's financial plan improved significantly when it was realized he had overestimated his retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Most people tend to spend less in retirement than during their working years, with spending typically dropping by about 20% upon retirement and often declining further with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

*   **Revised Spending Plan** Andy's spending estimate was adjusted to:
    *   $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

This adjustment extended Andy's savings to last until age 85, a substantial improvement from the initial estimate of age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This emphasizes that accurately estimating retirement costs, accounting for lifestyle, health, and [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | inflation]], is critical for a sound financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Introduction
New tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on imports from Canada have introduced further uncertainty into the Canadian economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This latest trade dispute adds significant pressure to the [[canadian_tax_system_overview | Canadian economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Economic Pressure
The tariffs create economic fallout that may force the Canadian government to prioritize defending Canadian industries over implementing unpopular tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The threat of these tariffs could encourage businesses and investments to shift south to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Influence on Capital Gains Tax Policy
The imposition of these tariffs contributes to the likelihood of the capital gains tax hike being reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The new trade dispute puts increased pressure on the [[canadian_tax_system_overview | Canadian economy]], making the proposed capital gains tax hike "even less likely" to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The existence of these tariffs is a factor in estimating an 80% chance of a full reversal of the capital gains tax increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

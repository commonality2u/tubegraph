Navigating medical expenses in Canada can be complex, even with public healthcare. Fortunately, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to [[claimable_medical_expenses_for_taxes | claim some of these costs on their taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide outlines how to calculate eligible medical expense claims, enabling you to keep more of your money.

## Understanding the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC)

The [[Medical expense tax credits in Canada | Medical Expense Tax Credit]] (METC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a> allows Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### How to Claim

To claim medical expenses, you must enter them on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For expenses for other dependants, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### The Calculation Rule

A crucial part of the calculation involves subtracting a specific amount from your total eligible expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. You must subtract the lower of:
*   3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
*   $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

The remaining amount is your eligible claim, which acts as a non-refundable credit reducing your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Examples of Medical Expense Calculations

### General Calculation Example (Jessica)

Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her income: $50,000 * 0.03 = $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Eligible claim: $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% of income) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Jessica can claim $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   Eligible claim: $3,000 (total expenses) - $1,800 (3% of income) = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

*   3% of his income: $150,000 * 0.03 = $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   Threshold amount for 2024: $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>

## [[Maximizing medical expenses and charitable donations for tax credits | Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs]]

When claiming medical expenses for a family, strategically choosing who claims them can significantly impact your tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Family Calculation Example (Richard and Pauline)

Richard and Pauline have two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), and a total family medical expense of $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Richard's expenses: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pauline's expenses: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen's (under 18) expenses: $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Rob's (over 18) expenses: $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

Jen's expenses ($1,800) are combined with Richard's and Pauline's, totaling $6,300, which is eligible for Line 33099. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Now, determine who should claim the $6,300:
*   **Pauline's income**: $55,000
    *   3% of her income: $55,000 * 0.03 = $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>
    *   Her eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   **Richard's income**: $42,000
    *   3% of his income: $42,000 * 0.03 = $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
    *   His eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   *Pro Tip*: Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

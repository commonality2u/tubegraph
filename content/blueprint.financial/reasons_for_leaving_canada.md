A growing number of Canadians are choosing to leave the country, with emigration to the United States alone seeing a staggering 70% increase in 2022 compared to 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. In 2022, 126,340 Canadians moved to the US, up from 75,752 in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's estimated that approximately 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad in 2016, a number that has likely grown since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This trend is part of broader [[relocation_and_migration_trends_in_canada | relocation and migration trends in Canada]] as individuals seek to address concerns about their quality of life.

Many Canadians are feeling "fed up" with high taxes, outrageous inflation, and freezing winters, prompting them to consider leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Key Factors Driving Emigration

### Rising Cost of Living
The primary reason cited for Canadians wanting to leave is the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | rising cost of living]], particularly in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where housing prices have skyrocketed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Moving to countries such as [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | Mexico]], [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | Portugal]], or even parts of the [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | United States]] can significantly reduce one's cost of living due to more affordable housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Harsh Winters
Canada's harsh winters, characterized by temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, motivate many to seek milder climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The prospect of "trading in snow shovels for beach towels" is highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Healthcare System Challenges
Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Issues include:
*   Long wait times for medical services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   A low doctor-to-population ratio, leading to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>

According to the Commonwealth Fund, Canada ranks poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Desire for Adventure and New Experiences
Beyond practical concerns, living abroad offers the opportunity for adventure and new experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It allows individuals to immerse themselves in new cultures, cuisines, and ways of life, providing opportunities for personal growth and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

If a vehicle is used for business purposes, such as visiting clients, picking up supplies, or other business-related travel, a portion of its costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These deductions are considered among the [[simple_tax_deductions_for_small_businesses_in_canada | simplest tax deductions for small businesses in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Deductible Vehicle Costs
Claimable vehicle expenses include:
*   Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Lease payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

## Calculating the Deduction
To calculate the deductible amount, determine the percentage of your total driving that was for business and apply that percentage to your overall vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

> For example, if you spent $10,000 on your vehicle last year, and out of 20,000 km driven, 5,000 km were for business, then 25% of your vehicle expenses ($2,500) are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Vehicle Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance - CCA)
Depreciation for vehicles is a significant write-off, similar to [[intermediate_level_tax_writeoffs_including_hiring_family_members_and_equipment_depreciation | equipment depreciation]] (also known as Capital Cost Allowance or CCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Specific rules apply to certain vehicle types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For luxury cars, the maximum cost that can be claimed for [[estimating_car_depreciation_and_its_impact_on_decision_making | depreciation]] is capped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. As of the latest update, this limit is $36,000 plus sales tax at a 30% CCA rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

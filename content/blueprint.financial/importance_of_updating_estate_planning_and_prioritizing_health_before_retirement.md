While managing finances is a significant part of [[financial_planning_for_retirement | retirement planning]], it's equally crucial to plan for your well-being and life itself. Two key personal steps for a fulfilling and stress-free retirement include updating your [[estate_planning_and_rrsp | estate planning]] documents and prioritizing your health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

## Update Your Estate Planning Documents

Although often overlooked, [[estate_planning_and_rrsp | estate planning]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:56">[09:20:56]</a>. Keeping your documents current ensures your assets are distributed exactly as you intend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:09">[09:23:09]</a>.

Key actions include:
*   **Wills**: Ensure your will is up to date to reflect your current wishes regarding asset distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:09">[09:23:09]</a>.
*   **Power of Attorney**: Assigning a power of attorney is crucial. This is someone you trust to make financial or healthcare decisions on your behalf if you become unable to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:07">[09:27:07]</a>.
*   **Beneficiaries**: Review beneficiaries and successors on accounts such as your RRSPs, TFSAs, and life insurance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:03">[09:36:03]</a>.

Life changes, such as marriage, divorce, or the birth of a grandchild, often necessitate updates to these documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:01">[09:42:01]</a>. For instance, Tom discovered his ex-wife was still listed as a beneficiary on his life insurance, which was not his current wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:05">[09:47:05]</a>. Ensuring these details are current can prevent significant issues in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>. Consulting legal experts can ensure your [[estate_planning_and_rrsp | estate plan]] is sound and aligns with your wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

## Prioritize Your Health and Regular Checkups

Your health is the foundation of a happy retirement; without it, money loses its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:05">[10:07:05]</a>.

Make health a priority by:
*   **Annual Checkups**: Schedule regular annual checkups with your doctor to monitor vital signs like blood pressure and cholesterol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Screenings**: Stay current with essential screenings, such as cancer screenings, to detect potential issues early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Dental and Vision**: Don't overlook dental and visual appointments, as maintaining these can significantly enhance your quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   **Chronic Conditions**: If you have chronic conditions, work closely with your healthcare team for effective management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

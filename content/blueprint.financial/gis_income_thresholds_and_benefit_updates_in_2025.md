The [[guaranteed_income_supplement_eligibility_and_benefits | Guaranteed Income Supplement]] (GIS) provides financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Payment Dates in 2025

The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for CPP, OAS, and [[guaranteed_income_supplement_eligibility_and_benefits | GIS]] in 2025, meaning recipients will receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Payments are typically scheduled for the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received slightly earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip: For added convenience and reliability, setting up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account ensures payments land in your account on time and is safer than waiting for a mailed check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

[[guaranteed_income_supplement_eligibility_and_benefits | GIS]] payments are adjusted every quarter to align with changes in the [[cost_of_living_adjustments_for_cpp_oas_and_gis_in_2025 | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   **January to March 2025 Quarter:** The maximum monthly [[guaranteed_income_supplement_eligibility_and_benefits | GIS]] payment for a single senior remains at $1,086, as there was no CPI increase observed over the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Annual Growth:** Despite no quarterly increase for early 2025, [[guaranteed_income_supplement_eligibility_and_benefits | GIS]] benefits have grown by 2% over the past year (January 2024 to January 2025), helping seniors keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

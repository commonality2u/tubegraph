Filing your taxes late can lead to significant financial repercussions from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is considered one of the [[common_tax_filing_mistakes | common tax filing mistakes]] to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Consequences of Late Filing

If you owe taxes, the CRA imposes a penalty of 5% on the unpaid balance, along with an additional 1% per month until the amount is settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These penalties can increase if you repeatedly file late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Even if you don't owe any taxes, filing late can cause delays in receiving your tax refunds and essential benefits such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Avoiding Late Filing Penalties

To prevent [[understanding_cra_penalties_and_taxes_on_tfsa | costly penalties]] and stress, it is advisable to set a reminder well in advance of the April 30th tax deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If you anticipate owing taxes, you should still file on time, even if you cannot pay immediately, to avoid incurring penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Many Canadians believe that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement, but relying heavily on these benefits can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Understanding how much you're likely to receive and what life on these benefits truly looks like is crucial for [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | securing your financial future in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Understanding Canadian Government Benefits

For most Canadians, retirement income typically comes from multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, if you are relying solely on CPP and OAS, it's important to know the expected amounts and whether they can cover basic expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan is determined by your lifetime earnings, meaning higher contributions during working years lead to higher payouts in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Most people do not receive the maximum amount, as it requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Here's an overview of CPP payouts in 2025 at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>:
*   **Starting at age 60:**
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Delaying until age 65:**
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Delaying until age 70:**
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $2,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

A key takeaway is that taking CPP early significantly reduces your monthly payment, while waiting until age 70 can boost benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, you must be able to afford the delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. CPP is designed to replace only about 25% to 33% of your working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS)
The OAS pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not based on employment income and is available regardless of your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and deferral choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

OAS maximum monthly payments as of March 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>:
*   Between ages 65 and 74: Approximately $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Age 75 and older: Jumps by 10% to approximately $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An automatic 10% increase occurs at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
If your total income is very low, you may qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), a government benefit for very low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The maximum GIS for 2024 is $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. GIS is reduced dollar for dollar if you have additional income, so even small RRSP withdrawals can affect eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Total Estimated Income
If you have no other income source, your total monthly retirement income from these benefits might be around $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   CPP: Approximately $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   OAS: Approximately $700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   GIS: Approximately $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total:** Approximately $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

Note that OAS does not count toward GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Living on $2,000 per month with GIS is barely above the poverty line, making it a challenging plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Cost of Living Breakdown: A Reality Check

Retiring on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada is technically possible but not comfortable, requiring serious sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Major Expenses
*   **Housing:**
    *   If you own a home outright, you still need to budget for property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, potentially $500 or more per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   Renting, even in smaller cities, can cost a minimum of $1,000 per month, consuming over half your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Rents in major cities like Toronto or Vancouver easily exceed $2,000 per month for a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries:** A basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month, with eating out being infrequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** For those under 65 without provincial coverage, private insurance may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be major expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation:** Costs include electricity, heating, internet, and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership adds $200-$500 per month for insurance, gas, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, while public transit can cost at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations
Living on a limited income means significant lifestyle restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>:
*   **No Travel Budget:** Even domestic trips would require serious saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **No Big Purchases:** Furniture, appliances, or a new car are likely out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund Issues:** You're likely living month-to-month, so unexpected bills can cause financial instability, potentially requiring reliance on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

In essence, it's a barebones lifestyle, making it difficult to enjoy your golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## When Living on CPP/OAS Alone Might (or Might Not) Work

### When It Could Work
Relying solely on CPP and OAS is challenging, but it might be possible under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:
*   **Own Your Home Outright:** Eliminating mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners can also consider borrowing against their home or downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Live in a Very Low-Cost Area:** Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Share Housing Costs:** Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Have Extra Support:** Financial help from family, investment income, or a part-time job makes a huge difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree in a small town in Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When It Falls Apart
For most retirees, relying solely on CPP and OAS is insufficient due to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:
*   **Major City Costs of Living:** Surviving in major cities on this income is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses:** Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **No Savings:** Without emergency funds, every month is a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement constantly worrying about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Strategies to Bridge the Gap

If CPP and OAS won't cover your expenses, you're not alone, and there are ways to bridge the shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>:

*   **Delay CPP and OAS:** Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP grows by 42% by delaying to age 70, and OAS increases by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Part-time Work or Delaying Retirement:** Picking up part-time work or working longer can help ensure your money lasts throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs:** Downsizing frees up capital for homeowners, while relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or abroad can make your money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Take Advantage of Government Benefits:** Programs like the Allowance for the Survivor can provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Planning:** [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]], pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal [[financial_strategies for retirement | strategies]] can lower your tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Creative Approaches for Limited Income Retirement

Some retirees are thinking outside the box to make a limited income work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>:

*   **House Hacking:** Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or even becoming house-sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Turning Hobbies into Income:** Monetizing skills like teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements:** Programs like TrustedHousesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement:** A growing trend where retirees slow-travel through low-cost countries, taking advantage of extended tourist visas to live for months at a time where their pension stretches further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. For example, a retiree in Mexico lived on about $1,500 a month, covering $600 rent and daily meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Retiring Abroad:** Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal can offer a higher quality of life for the same income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, healthcare access can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Most retirees pursuing this are in their 60s or early 70s, active and healthy enough to embrace the lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

If you're relying solely on CPP and OAS, a backup plan is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The sooner you plan for retirement, the more options you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If you're still working, now is the time to put a plan in place to avoid relying solely on these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

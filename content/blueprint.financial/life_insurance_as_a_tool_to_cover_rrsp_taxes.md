Upon death, an entire Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance is added to the deceased's income for that year and taxed at the highest marginal tax rate, potentially pushing the estate's income into a high tax bracket, such as 53% in Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This can result in a significant portion of the RRSP disappearing to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

For instance, if someone with a $700,000 RRSP balance passes away in Ontario, their estate could owe $371,000 in taxes, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. To prevent such a large tax hit, one effective method is to use life insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
A permanent life insurance policy can be purchased, where the payout is designed to cover the tax bill on your RRSP at the time of your passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This ensures that your loved ones receive the full value of your RRSP, as the insurance proceeds will offset the tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

A clever twist involves using small, gradual [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RRSP withdrawals]] to pay the life insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This strategy spreads out the tax burden over time, making the premium payments manageable and reducing the RRSP balance, which in turn lowers the final tax hit at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Example: John and Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>
John (72) and Mary (70) had a joint RRSP balance of $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Without proper planning, their estate could have faced a tax bill of up to half a million dollars on their RRSPs alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

To avoid this, they purchased a joint last-to-die permanent life insurance policy with a minimum death benefit of approximately $632,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This amount was calculated to cover the entire tax bill and provide extra funds for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Their insurance policy required annual premiums of $50,000 for only the first six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Instead of paying these premiums out-of-pocket, they decided to withdraw $50,000 per year from their RRSP to cover the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. By doing this gradually, they spread out the tax burden over time, avoiding a large lump-sum tax hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

After six years, the policy was fully paid up, and no further premium payments were required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. When John and Mary passed away ten years later, the policy had grown to over $777,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This life insurance payout covered the estate's entire tax bill for the RRSPs, with extra funds remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
*   **Double Benefit**: The insurance payout is completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Using RRSP withdrawals to fund premiums reduces the RRSP balance, lowering the final tax hit at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This effectively trades RRSP income for tax-free growth within the life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Avoids Upfront Payments**: By paying premiums through gradual RRSP withdrawals, large upfront payments from existing assets are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Policy Paid Up**: After a set period (e.g., six years in the example), the policy can be fully paid up with no further premiums, and the life insurance payout continues to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Peace of Mind**: Provides assurance that the estate will be preserved for heirs and tax obligations covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   **Eligibility**: Not everyone qualifies for life insurance, particularly those with pre-existing health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Tax on Withdrawals**: The annual RRSP withdrawals used for premiums are taxed as income, which can increase tax liability during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning Required**: Careful planning is necessary to avoid paying too much tax due to these withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Combining Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
This strategy can be effectively combined with other approaches, such as [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | RRSP income splitting]] (e.g., a higher-earning spouse contributing to a spousal RRSP) and [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | gradual RRSP withdrawals]] to manage annual taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. By combining life insurance with a strategy of gradual RRSP withdrawals to cover premiums, the tax burden is smoothed out, and the inheritance for loved ones is maximized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

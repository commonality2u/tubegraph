Despite over $2 trillion invested in mutual funds in Canada as of May 2024, they are nearly five times as popular as Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, there are significant downsides to these investment vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## What are Actively Managed Mutual Funds?
When discussing [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual funds]] in this context, the focus is on high-cost, actively managed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from many investors to create a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. They are typically overseen by professional portfolio managers who aim to outperform a benchmark index through strategic buying and selling decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian mutual funds often fall short of this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Reasons for Underperformance

The primary reasons actively managed mutual funds in Canada [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperform]] their benchmarks are high fees, misleading marketing tactics, and tax inefficiencies.

### 1. High Fees
[[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | Mutual fund fees]] in Canada are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   The average asset-weighted management expense ratio (MER) for equity funds in Canada is around 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   For allocation funds, it's about 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   For fixed income funds, it's 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Many equity fund MERs from major banks exceed 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

While a 2% management fee may seem small, its long-term impact on investment returns is substantial due to compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Impact of a 2% Fee
> If Kim invests $100,000 in a mutual fund with an average annual return of 7%:
> *   **Without fees:** Her investment would grow to approximately $387,000 over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
> *   **With a 2% fee:** Her actual return becomes 5% after fees, growing to only $265,000 over the same 20 years. This is a difference of $122,000, nearly a third of her potential returns lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
> Over 30 years, the difference becomes even more dramatic: $761,000 without fees versus $432,000 with a 2% fee, a staggering difference of $329,000 (43% of potential returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

While [[hidden_investment_fees_in_Canada | mutual fund fees]] have seen a slight decrease recently due to regulatory changes and fee-based advice, they remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### 2. Consistent Low Returns
A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada consistently [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperform]] their respective benchmarks across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   **Canadian Equity Funds:** Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformed]] their benchmark, the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   The S&P TSX Composite Index gained an annualized return of 7.62% over those 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   In contrast, Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
    *   This 2% difference closely matches the average fees charged, suggesting that active managers often perform at the market average *before* fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

*   **Category-Specific Underperformance (10-year period):**
    *   Canadian-focused Equity Funds: 98% [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformed]] their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds: 88.6% fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Canadian small to mid-cap equity funds: 76.19% [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformed]] their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This consistent [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformance]] across different fund categories highlights a systemic issue within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### 3. Tricky Marketing Tactics & Survivorship Bias
Banks and financial institutions often engage in marketing tactics that obscure the true [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformance]] of mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. They tend to:
*   **Highlight Success Stories:** Only showcasing top-performing funds and omitting underperforming ones that were closed or merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Utilize Survivorship Bias:** This bias occurs when only the surviving, better-performing funds are included in performance reports, while poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This creates a misleadingly positive picture of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

> [!STATISTICS] Fund Disappearance Rates
> *   Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
> *   On average across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
> *   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
> *   For Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### 4. Tax Inefficiency Concerns
[[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_Canada | Tax inefficiency]] can significantly impact the net returns of mutual funds, especially when held in non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains Distribution:** Mutual funds are required to distribute realized capital gains to investors annually, even if the investor hasn't sold shares. This can result in a tax bill for gains not directly realized by the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading:** Actively managed funds often trade frequently, leading to short-term capital gains. These gains are taxed at a higher rate (regular income tax rate) compared to long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing:** Investors are subject to the fund manager's decisions on when to realize gains or losses, which can lead to taxable events at inconvenient times, increasing tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

To avoid these tax inefficiencies, investing in a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is often recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Why Mutual Funds Remain Popular
Despite their [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformance]] and high costs, over $2 trillion remains invested in Canadian mutual funds due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>:
*   **Aggressive Distribution Channels:** Mutual funds are highly accessible and convenient, offering a straightforward way to diversify without extensive market knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Banks and financial advisors actively push these high-profit products due to aggressive sales targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Perceived Professional Management:** Many investors are drawn to the idea that professional portfolio managers, seen as experts, can make informed investment decisions and achieve high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This marketing, combined with the trust in large financial institutions, sways many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Ratings like Morningstar's five-star ratings can also mislead investors into believing in superior performance, even though studies suggest these funds often [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperform]] in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

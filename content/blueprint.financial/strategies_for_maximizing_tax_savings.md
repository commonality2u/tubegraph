The tax deadline in Canada is April 30th, and claiming available tax credits is crucial to avoid leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canada offers numerous tax credits, and understanding them can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide will walk you through key tax credits, including common ones and hidden gems, and show you how to stack multiple credits for even bigger tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Key Tax Credits to Know

While some credits are automatically applied, many require manual claiming on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)
The BPA is a non-refundable tax credit allowing Canadians to earn a portion of income tax-free before federal income tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the BPA is $1,129 for individuals with net incomes below the 29% tax bracket threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim this non-refundable credit, designed to reduce taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, the credit is gradually reduced if your net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> If Selena is 66 years old and earns $42,000, she qualifies for the full $9,280 age amount credit. If she earns $46,000, the credit will begin to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | tax break]] helps retirees keep more of their money while managing taxable income efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)
The CCA provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim $8,610 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For a child under 18 with a disability, the credit amount is $8,610 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income, and eligibility can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Additional amounts may be claimed for spouses or common-law partners in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It's important to retain medical documentation if required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Medical Expenses Tax Credit
This credit helps Canadians offset out-of-pocket healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. You can claim eligible medical expenses that exceed 3% of your net income or $2,834, whichever is lower for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Eligible expenses include prescriptions, dental care, vision care, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, other medical treatments, and medical travel expenses if care isn't available locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

> [!tip] Maximizing Your Claim
> Combine expenses for yourself, your spouse, and dependents. Keep detailed records and receipts for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Many Canadians forget to track these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Pension Income Amount
Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. [[advanced_strategies_like_income_splitting_and_tax_loss_harvesting | Pension income splitting]] allows couples to allocate eligible pension income for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Up to 75% of your net income can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Stacking Multiple Credits for Bigger Refunds

The key to [[planning_and_implementing_taxsaving_strategies | maximizing tax savings]] isn't just knowing about individual credits but stacking them together for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many Canadians don't realize how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Savings Combo

A common example of [[tax_saving_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | tax saving strategies for investments in Canada]] involves combining the pension income amount with the age amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Amount:** Up to $2,000 per person for eligible pension income, reducing taxes for those 65+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Credit:** Worth up to $928 federally in 2025 for those 65+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

> [!example] Example: John and Linda
> John and Linda are both retired; John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Since they are both over 65, they can each claim the pension income amount to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. John also qualifies for the age amount credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo

Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. If you have kids or dependents, here's how to maximize your savings:
*   **Canada Child Benefits (CCB):** Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Claim daycare, babysitting, or after-school program costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount:** For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Sarah and Mike
> Sarah and Mike have two young children; their children are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
> *   **Canada Child Benefit:** They receive tax-free monthly payments to help with child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
> *   **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
> *   **Canada Caregiver Amount:** Since one child has a disability, they get an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
>
> Stacked Savings: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of Dollars in Tax Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

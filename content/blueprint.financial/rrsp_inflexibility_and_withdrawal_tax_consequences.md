Many Canadians initially assume that [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs)]] are a straightforward tool for saving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, common misconceptions can lead to significant regrets and tax complications, particularly regarding the flexibility and tax implications of withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Inflexibility of RSP Funds

A major regret among RSP holders is the perceived inflexibility of their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Many realize too late how difficult it is to access their money, especially when compared to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Unlike a TFSA, where withdrawals are tax-free and contribution room is restored, RSP withdrawals incur steep tax consequences and permanently reduce contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Individuals needing quick access to savings for emergencies or unexpected expenses often regret locking their money away in an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

RSP withdrawals are not easily accessible like a regular bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Every dollar withdrawn is taxed as income, which can push the individual into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

> For example, Lisa earns $65,000 annually. When she withdraws $20,000 from her RSP for emergency home repairs, her taxable income jumps to $85,000, significantly increasing her tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Unlike a TFSA, she cannot recontribute the money, permanently reducing her retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

An analogy describes a TFSA as an "open safe" allowing free deposits and withdrawals, whereas an RSP is likened to a "vault with a time lock," where getting money out comes with a costly price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Withholding Tax Surprise

Another significant regret stems from underestimating the automatic withholding tax applied to RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Many assume they will only owe tax at filing time, not realizing a portion is deducted upfront, leaving them with less immediate cash than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The withholding rates depend on the amount being withdrawn early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

*   **Up to $5,000:** 10% withheld
*   **$5,001 to $15,000:** 20% withheld
*   **Over $15,000:** 30% withheld

> For example, Jeff withdraws $10,000 for an emergency expense. His bank withholds 20% ($2,000), meaning he only receives $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, if his marginal tax rate is higher than 20%, he will owe an additional $1,000 in taxes when he files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
>
> Similarly, Maria, a retiree, withdraws $25,000 for a vacation. Her bank automatically withholds 30% ($7,500), leaving her with $17,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. At tax time, if her income rate is higher than 30%, she may be forced to pay an additional $2,500 beyond what was already deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Many individuals regret assuming the withholding tax was the final amount owed, leading to an unpleasant surprise at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This makes early RSP withdrawals far less appealing than they might initially seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Strategic Planning for RSP Use

Before contributing to an RSP, it's crucial to ask if the money will be needed before retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. If the answer is "yes" or "maybe," a TFSA or another account might be a better choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, if used strategically for long-term retirement savings, an RSP can be a powerful tool for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The key is to plan ahead so that the RSP works for the individual, not against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

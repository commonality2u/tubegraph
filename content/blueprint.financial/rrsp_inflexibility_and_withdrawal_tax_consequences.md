Many Canadians assume Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) are a guaranteed good option for saving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, misconceptions about RRSPs can lead to significant regrets and tax issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A primary area of concern is the inflexibility of RRSP funds and the [[Tax implications of RRSP withdrawals | tax implications]] associated with their withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## RRSP Money is Too Inflexible

A common regret among Canadians is contributing to an RRSP only to discover how challenging it is to access their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unlike a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), where withdrawals are tax-free and contribution room is restored, [[impact_of_rsp_withdrawals_on_taxes | RRSP withdrawals]] come with steep tax consequences and permanently reduce contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Those who need quick access to savings for emergencies or unexpected expenses often regret locking their money in an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

RRSP withdrawals are not easily accessible like a regular bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Every dollar withdrawn is taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For instance, Lisa, earning $65,000 annually, withdrew $20,000 from her RRSP for emergency home repairs, causing her taxable income to jump to $85,000 and increasing her tax bill significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Moreover, unlike a TFSA, the withdrawn money cannot be re-contributed, permanently reducing her retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> Think of your TFSA as an open safe where you can freely take money in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. An RRSP, however, is more akin to a vault with a time lock; once money is deposited, retrieving it comes with a costly price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Withholding Tax Surprise

A significant regret is underestimating the automatic [[withholding_tax_surprises_on_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] applied to RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Many mistakenly assume tax will only be owed at filing time, not realizing a portion is deducted upfront, leaving them with less cash than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Withholding rates vary based on the withdrawal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

*   **Example: Jeff**
    *   Jeff withdrew $10,000 for an emergency expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   His bank withheld 20% ($2,000), so he only received $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Because his marginal tax rate was higher than 20%, he had to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes when he filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Example: Maria**
    *   Maria, a retiree, withdrew $25,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Her bank automatically withheld 30% ($7,500), leaving her with $17,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   At tax time, her income rate was even higher than 30%, forcing her to pay an additional $2,500 beyond what was already deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Many regret assuming the withholding tax was the final amount owed, leading to unpleasant surprises at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This makes early [[impact_of_rsp_withdrawals_on_taxes | RRSP withdrawals]] far less appealing than they might initially seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

> Before contributing to an RRSP, ask yourself: "Do I need this money before retirement?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> If the answer is yes or even maybe, a TFSA or another account might be a better choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, for strategic retirement long-term tax savings, an RRSP can be a powerful tool, provided you plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## RRSP Withdrawal Challenges in Retirement

Many retirees regret not planning their [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RRSP withdrawals]] properly, which can lead to higher taxes, lost government benefits, and forced withdrawals that don't align with their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

> Think of your RRSP refund like a boomerang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Getting a refund feels great when you invest, but most people don't realize that the boomerang swings back later, hitting you with taxes on withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Unexpected Tax Burden on Withdrawals

Unlike TFSAs, every RRSP withdrawal is fully taxable income, which can significantly affect retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. For example, David, who earns $40,000 from CPP and a pension, withdrew $50,000 from his RRSP for home renovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This increased his taxable income to $90,000, triggering a much larger tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He could have reduced his tax burden by withdrawing smaller amounts over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Forced Withdrawals at Age 71

By age 71, RRSPs must be converted into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), requiring mandatory withdrawals each year, regardless of whether the retiree needs the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **Example: Michael**
    *   Michael has $500,000 in his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   When he turns 71, current rules mandate he withdraw close to 5%, which is $26,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   This increases his taxable income to $76,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   As he ages, higher withdrawal rates force him to take out even more, compounding the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Losing OAS Benefits to RRSP Withdrawals

Old Age Security (OAS) benefits begin to be clawed back at around $91,000, according to 2024 thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Large RRSP withdrawals can push retirees over this limit, reducing or eliminating OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Many regret not spreading out withdrawals earlier to avoid losing thousands in government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

RRSPs can be a powerful tool, but only if used wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Proper planning can help Canadians avoid common regrets and traps, save on taxes, and build a solid retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

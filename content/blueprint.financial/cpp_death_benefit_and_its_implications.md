The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) includes a one-time, lump-sum payment known as the CPP Death Benefit, which is typically paid to the estate of the deceased contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## What is the CPP Death Benefit?

The CPP Death Benefit is a single payment intended to help cover immediate expenses following a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It can alleviate the financial burden in the initial weeks after a death, for instance, by contributing to funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

The amount of the CPP Death Benefit is typically $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In some instances, it may be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Tax Implications

All CPP benefits, including the CPP Death Benefit, survivorship pension, and child benefit, are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Recipients must report these benefits on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

[[tax_implications_of_cpp | Understanding how these benefits work]] and their associated tax implications can be challenging, particularly during difficult and emotional times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

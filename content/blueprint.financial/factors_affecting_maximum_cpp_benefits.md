While you may have worked hard your entire life, collecting Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can come as a shock, as most Canadians do not receive anywhere near the maximum payment of around $2,000 per month, even after decades of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The average payment for someone starting at age 60 is approximately $530 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Three primary [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | factors affect your CPP payout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>: salary, timing of collection, and consistency of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Why Earning a High Salary Doesn't Guarantee Max CPP

To receive the maximum CPP payout, your salary and income must be high enough to consistently meet the maximum contribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, what counts as "maximum" has changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Beginning in 2024, CPP introduced a second earning ceiling, known as YMP, meaning higher income earners now contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In 2024, the YMP is $81,300, which is the amount you need to earn annually to receive maximum CPP payments upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The maximum earnings threshold has steadily increased over time, making it more challenging to reach maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
*   In 1990, the maximum CPP threshold was $28,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   In 2000, it was $37,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   In 2010, it was $47,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

What qualified as a high enough salary to max out CPP in the past is insufficient today, and this trend of increasing thresholds will continue, requiring even higher salaries for younger Canadians to qualify for the maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] James's Salary Impact
> James earned at least the maximum YMP every year for nearly four decades and decided to start collecting CPP at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Despite consistent high earnings, he would receive approximately $917 per month, which is less than half of the maximum possible payout of $2,034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This illustrates that even with a consistently high income, you may not receive the maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | impact of salary on CPP contributions]].

## Delaying CPP: Why Timing Matters

One of the most significant [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | factors determining your CPP payout]] is when you begin collecting it; the longer you wait, the higher your monthly payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Here's how CPP payments change based on when you start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:
*   **Age 60:** The average monthly payment is $540, with a maximum possible amount of $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Starting at age 60 reduces your payments by around 36%, a reduction that lasts for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Age 65:** The average payment increases to $888, with a maximum of $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Age 70:** Delaying until age 70 boosts your pay by 42% compared to taking it at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Despite the substantial financial benefits of waiting, less than 2% of Canadians delay CPP until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Therefore, if you don't receive the maximum amount, you are not alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> [!INFO] Inflation Indexing
> CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning your payments will continue to rise over time to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. In recent years, CPP payouts have increased significantly due to higher inflation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> [!TIP] Delaying Old Age Security (OAS)
> Consider delaying [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] alongside CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. OAS also increases by 0.6% per month after age 65, which can significantly impact your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

While delaying CPP offers significant benefits, it's not suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | Factors such as your life expectancy]], financial situation, and income needs must be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Contribution Gaps: Why Even High Earners Can Fall Short

Even if you earn a high salary and delay CPP to age 70, you might not receive the full $2,034 per month because CPP is based on your lifetime contributions, not just your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. To get the maximum CPP payout, you need to have at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Many individuals fall short due to gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Common reasons for contribution gaps include:
*   **Career Breaks:** Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care can result in years with no CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While the child rearing provision can help in some cases, many still have gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership:** If you were self-employed or paid lower or inconsistent CPP contributions, this can reduce your lifetime average, even with higher earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment:** Years of unemployment, even if followed by a very high salary, can drag down your average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry:** If you retired before age 65 or started working late, you might not accumulate the full 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Jerry and Elaine
> Jerry and Elaine were both high-income earners who contributed the maximum to CPP throughout their careers and delayed collecting until age 70, expecting the full $2,034 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Elaine received the full amount because she had 39 years of maximum contributions with no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Jerry, however, received less than $1,500 because he had many contribution gaps, possibly due to starting a business, returning to school, or periods of unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Even though he maxed out his salary in working years, the missing years lowered his average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### How Contribution Gaps Affect Your Final CPP Pay

CPP uses your best 39 years of contributions to calculate your retirement benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The program includes a "general dropout provision" which allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest-earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Since CPP considers 47 years of potential contributions (from ages 18 to 65), this means you could drop about 8 years of low or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you delay CPP to 70, your total working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains roughly 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This provision helps reduce the impact of short gaps in your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. However, if you miss more than 8 years of contributions, your final payout will be lower, even if you earned a high salary and delayed CPP to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This is precisely what happened to Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## How to Maximize Your CPP Based on These Three Key Factors

To get the maximum CPP payout, you need to optimize all three of these factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Here are [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | strategies to maximize CPP payouts]]:

### 1. Delay CPP as Long as Possible (Ideally to Age 70)
Delaying CPP is the easiest way to increase your payout as it doesn't require earning more or changing your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Delaying past 65 increases your CPP by 8.4% per year, up to a 42% boost at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   Starting before 65 decreases your CPP by 7.2% per year, up to a 36% reduction at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   It's crucial to plan to have other income sources (e.g., investments, TFSAs, RRSPs) to cover expenses while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### 2. Earn at Least the YMP (Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings) for as Many Years as Possible
This is the most challenging factor, as increasing your income isn't simply a "flip of a switch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. However, if you can increase your income over time, it directly increases your CPP payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Negotiate higher wages and promotions:** The more you earn, the more you can contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Start a side hustle or business:** If self-employed, ensure you contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Level up your skills:** Invest in certifications, training, or new skills to land higher-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Switch jobs strategically:** Changing employers can often result in faster salary growth than remaining in the same position for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Avoid Contribution Gaps and Maximize Your Contribution Years
Even with delayed CPP and a high salary, you won't get the full amount if you have too many missing years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Aim to work for at least 39 years with strong contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Missing too many years will lower your average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   CPP allows you to drop up to 8 years of low or no contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. However, if you miss more than that, your payouts will be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   Try to use the child rearing provision to exclude low-income years if you took time off to raise children under seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Maximizing your CPP is not just about earning more; it's about making smart decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The right [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_benefits | strategy can mean hundreds more per month]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

When [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retiring abroad]], many Canadians are surprised by how their government income benefits are affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Key benefits like Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) behave differently when a recipient moves outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit intended to support low-income seniors who reside in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Portability**: GIS is **not portable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This applies even if your income remains low and you continue filing Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Social Security Agreements**: There is no social security agreement that protects your GIS; it is strictly tied to your physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Gan, a 71-year-old retiree, moved to Mexico and found her GIS terminated a few months into her move because she was outside Canada for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> If GIS is a critical part of your retirement income, consider delaying your move, adjusting your budget, or exploring other income options to replace the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Some retirees, known as "snowbirds," maintain part-year residency in Canada to keep their health care and tax status, ensuring they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

[[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_living_abroad | CPP benefits]] are based on your contributions during your working life in Canada, not on your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Portability**: Your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_living_abroad | CPP benefits]] will continue to be paid out regardless of where you live, with the amount remaining the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **[[tax_implications_of_cpp | Withholding Tax]]**: Your CPP payments may be subject to a non-resident [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]] if you are considered a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   Without a tax treaty, the default [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]] rate can be 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   If Canada has a tax treaty with your destination country, this tax could be reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. For instance, the tax treaty with the US may allow you to avoid [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Social Security Agreements**: Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries, which help avoid double contributions, ensure uninterrupted CPP coverage, and coordinate benefits if you worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Other Benefits**: CPP survivor benefits or child benefits also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Receiving Payments**: Payments can be direct deposited into a Canadian bank account, received in local currency through a local bank in many countries, or mailed as a check in Canadian dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Local Tax Laws**: It's important to check the local tax laws of your new country, as they might tax your CPP payments differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

OAS is based on residency, not on your work history or contributions like CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

*   **Qualification while Abroad**: You can receive OAS abroad if you have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If you meet this threshold, your monthly OAS payment will continue even if you live permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Less Than 20 Years Residency**: If you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave for more than six consecutive months (after the month of departure), your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and re-establish residency to resume receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Exceptions and Social Security Agreements**: You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time you lived in both countries is at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Note that years lived in another country help determine qualification but do not increase your OAS amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Tax Implications**: Your OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   Federal tax is not automatically withheld each month, but you can request voluntary tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   OAS may be subject to a non-resident [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]], with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   This rate may be reduced or eliminated entirely if you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, your OAS is not subject to [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]] due to the tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, a treaty, like with Germany, might allow Canada to tax public pensions like OAS at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Tax Filing**: While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. You must continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> To manage the OAS recovery tax (clawback), which begins at an income threshold of $93,454 in 2025, consider strategies like [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]], pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Planning Strategies

[[Tax planning for retirement in Canada | Tax planning]] and understanding how benefits behave when you move abroad is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Anita, age 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years in Canada. She qualified for CPP, OAS (due to 20+ years residency), and GIS. Upon moving to Portugal, which has a social security and tax treaty with Canada:
> *   Her CPP continued without interruption, subject to a reduced 15% [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]] thanks to the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
> *   Her OAS also continued because she met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
> *   Her GIS stopped after 6 months, as it requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
> Anita successfully planned by delaying her move until she hit 20 years residency, choosing a treaty country, and planning early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Summary of Benefit Behavior Abroad

*   **CPP**: Your "ride or die friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. It will follow you wherever you go, but watch out for potential [[tax_implications_of_cpp | withholding tax]] at your destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **OAS**: More "selective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It will only come if you have built a strong relationship (20+ years of living in Canada after age 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Otherwise, it might stay home unless you have mutual friends in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **GIS**: "Loves Canada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. It's generous while you're in Canada, but once you leave for more than 6 months, it stops completely with no treaty, no workaround, and no goodbye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Additional Pro Tips

*   Consider drawing down your [[rrsp_contributions_and_tax_implications_abroad | RRSPs]] before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Plan for private health care, as provincial coverage typically ends after 6 to 7 months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> The [[potential_tax_implications_of_retiring_overseas | financial rules change fast]] when [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retiring abroad]], and the consequences of not planning can be very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Seeking specialized financial advice is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

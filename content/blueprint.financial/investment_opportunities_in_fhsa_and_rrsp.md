Both the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) offer excellent opportunities for investment growth and tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. While the FHSA is Canada's newest account and often preferred, there are specific situations where the RRSP remains the smarter choice for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Shared Investment Potential

Both the FHSA and RRSP allow for a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. A key benefit of both accounts is that they offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on the gains while your investments grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This allows for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

While the FHSA is labelled a "savings account," it functions like both a savings and an investment account, allowing for strategic investments with significant growth potential, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Since both accounts offer the same investment potential, there is no clear winner in this specific aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. You can use either account to build a well-diversified investment portfolio that grows tax-deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The main difference lies in how you withdraw the funds, not how you invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Situations Favoring RRSP for Investments

Despite the FHSA's overall advantages, there are [[situations_favoring_rrsp_over_fhsa|two key situations where the RSP still comes out on top]] for investment purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Investing in US Stocks

If you plan to invest in US Stocks, the RRSP is the smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Dividends earned from US stocks in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can significantly reduce your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. However, thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, you can avoid this tax entirely by investing in US Stocks through your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Employer Matching Contributions

Another significant advantage of the RRSP is the availability of employer matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. If your employer offers to match your RRSP contributions, this is essentially free money that boosts your [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp|retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For example, if an employer matches up to $5,000 per year, contributing $5,000 to your RRSP would result in an additional $5,000 from your employer, totaling $10,000 in your account for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the FHSA generally comes out ahead in many [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp|comparisons]] due to its flexibility and [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp|tax advantages]] for home buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, the RRSP takes the lead for long-term investors in specific scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. If you are heavily investing in US dividend stocks or have access to employer matching RRSP contributions, prioritizing your RRSP makes more sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

This article compares the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | income thresholds for Canada's top 10%, 5%, and 1% of earners]] with the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age_group | average income of Canadians across different age groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Top Earner Income Thresholds (2022)

To understand the contrast, it's important to first note the income levels required to be considered a top earner in Canada as of 2022:

*   **Top 10%**: An individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Within this group, the median income was $147,100, and the average income was $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Top 5%**: An individual needed to earn at least $147,100 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The median income for this group was $193,800, and the average income was $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Top 1%**: An individual needed to earn at least $283,200 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Within this exclusive group, the median income was $388,200, and the average income was $586,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[comparison_of_median_and_average_incomes_in_canadas_top_earners | The significant gap between median and average incomes]] within these top groups highlights how a small number of ultra-high earners can significantly inflate the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. For example, the average income for the top 1% was nearly $200,000 higher than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Average Canadian Income by Age Group

In stark contrast to the top earner figures, the median income for most Canadians across different age groups ranged between $35,000 to about $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The highest median income is found in the 45 to 54 age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Direct Comparison

The disparity between top earners and average Canadians is significant:

*   **Top 10% vs. Average**: The highest median income for any age group (45 to 54 years old at $51,500) is still $51,500 below the top 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Top 5% vs. Average**: The threshold for the top 5% ($147,100) is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Top 1% vs. Average**: To enter the [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]], an individual needs to make nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Conclusion

While income levels vary significantly, the video emphasizes that income is "just the start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. It's what an individual does with their income that ultimately builds freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This idea is exemplified by stories like Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through consistent investing despite not earning a high salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

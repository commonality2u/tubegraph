The used car market saw a significant 40% price increase during the pandemic, but with prices now stabilizing, many consumers are re-evaluating their car acquisition strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The decision to buy, lease, or finance a car is complex, with no single answer fitting all situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## [[using_online_calculators_for_car_financing_decisions | Using Online Calculators for Car Financing Decisions]]

To assist in this decision, a free online calculator like the one available at Bankrate.com can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This calculator is user-friendly and can be applied to any car, regardless of location (e.g., America or [[options_for_acquiring_a_new_car_in_Canada | Canada]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

To use the calculator, you'll need to input several figures, ideally obtained from a dealership quote for financing, buying, or leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If a direct quote isn't available, information can often be found on the company's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Key inputs for the calculator include:
*   **Vehicle Price**: For an example, a Ford F-150 was used at $49,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   **Down Payment**: Can be set to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Tax Rate**: For example, 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Investment Rate of Return**: This crucial number represents the opportunity cost of not investing the money elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A higher rate makes buying less favorable than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Recommendations include 3-4% for conservative investors, 5-6% for middle-of-the-road, and 7%+ for aggressive portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. An example used 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Loan Term**: For comparison, a 48-month term was used for both buying and leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Annual Percentage Rate (APR)**: An example used 1.99% for buying and 4.49% for leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Dealerships should provide the actual rate, as eligibility for low rates depends on credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Fees**: Other fees, such as $2,495, should be included for both options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Depreciation Rate**: This is considered the most critical number for the calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For an example, 15% annual depreciation was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Residual Percent (Lease)**: This is the car's expected value at the end of the lease term, usually between 40-60%, and is provided by the dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. An example used 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Key Factors Influencing Your Choice

### [[understanding_car_depreciation_and_its_impact_on_buying_decisions | Understanding Car Depreciation and Its Impact on Buying Decisions]]
Car depreciation is a significant factor, akin to an iceberg where the initial value rapidly melts away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Methods to estimate depreciation:
1.  **Average Rates**: New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year and 15% annually for the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
2.  **Online Estimators**: Websites like Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book offer tools to estimate depreciation based on vehicle details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
3.  **Current Marketplaces**: This method, favored by some, involves checking sites like AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji for real-time listing and sale prices of similar vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This provides insight into actual market values rather than just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

The depreciation rate directly impacts the net cost of buying; a lower depreciation rate significantly reduces the net cost of buying, making it more favorable than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Conversely, higher depreciation makes buying less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Market Unpredictability
The actual market resale value at the end of a term is difficult to predict, as it depends on supply and demand fluctuations, which can sometimes be unrelated to vehicle reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, soaring used car prices meant those who had leased in 2017 missed out on potential profits from owning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Financial Takeaways
*   **High Resale Value**: If a vehicle is expected to have a high resale value, buying or financing is generally cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value**: If a vehicle is expected to have a low resale value, leasing becomes more cost-effective, especially if some payments can be written off for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **[[comparing_saving_versus_investing | Opportunity Cost]]**: When buying a car outright or making a large down payment, the potential earnings from investing that money elsewhere (opportunity cost) must be carefully considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Since financial estimates are often uncertain, [[nonfinancial_considerations_when_deciding_to_lease_or_buy_a_car | non-financial factors]] can significantly influence the buy-or-lease decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   **Ownership Preference**: Buy for long-term ownership and customization. Lease if you prefer new models every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Tax Write-offs**: Leasing offers deductible payments, while buying allows for depreciation and interest deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This choice depends on a business's financial strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Debt Aversion**: Leasing involves lower payments without long-term debt, but no equity is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Buying offers the freedom to sell at any time. Leasing locks you into a term but may include conveniences like warranty coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Plans**: Buy if you plan to keep the car for many years. Lease if you prefer frequent changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Environmental or Emotional Factors**: Buying supports sustainability and attachment to the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Leasing provides access to the latest eco-friendly models with higher turnover, which might feel less personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: Buying means covering maintenance post-warranty, whereas leasing often includes maintenance during the lease term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Insurance Costs**: Leased vehicles can potentially require higher insurance, increasing overall costs compared to buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **End-of-Lease Options**: Leasing allows the option to buy the car at the end of the term, offering flexibility if a purchase commitment is uncertain upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## The Case for Buying Used

Buying a used car is often considered the smartest financial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. By purchasing a car that is 3 to 5 years old, consumers can avoid this initial depreciation hit and gain more value for their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Cars in this age range typically have fewer major issues compared to older vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Additionally, used cars usually incur lower insurance costs and represent less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. With adequate research, it's possible to find a reliable, well-priced used car with features comparable to a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

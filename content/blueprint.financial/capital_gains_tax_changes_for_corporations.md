[[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | Big tax updates in 2025]] are set to significantly reshape how [[Strategies for investors and business owners in response to tax changes | business owners]] can plan and invest in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A primary focus of these changes is the [[capital_gains_and_losses_management_for_tax_savings | capital gains tax]] for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## New Inclusion Rate for Corporations

The year 2025 marks Canada's first full year with a new [[capital_gains_and_losses_management_for_tax_savings | capital gains tax]] structure for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The inclusion rate for corporate capital gains has been increased from 50% to 66.67%, or 2/3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This adjustment means that a larger portion of a corporation's capital gains will now be subject to taxation, directly impacting after-tax profits, investment decisions, and financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Illustrative Example

Consider ABC Corp, a Canadian corporation that sells an investment property in 2025 for a capital gain of $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Under Old Rules (50% inclusion rate)**:
    *   Taxable income: $100,000 (50% of $200,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Assuming a 10% corporate tax rate, the total tax owed would have been $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

*   **Under 2025 Rules (66.67% inclusion rate)**:
    *   Taxable income: Approximately $133,000 (66.67% of $200,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   At the same 10% corporate tax rate, the tax owed increases to $13,334 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

This results in an extra tax liability of $3,334 for the corporation compared to the previous rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This represents a significant increase in tax liabilities, particularly for businesses that frequently rely on capital gains from investments in real estate, securities, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Exclusions

It is important to note that these changes do not affect sole proprietors or self-employed individuals, who will continue to be taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The increased inclusion rate is strictly for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Planning Strategies for Corporations

Given the new inclusion rates, corporations should consider strategies to mitigate the impact:

1.  **Reassessing Investment Portfolios**:
    *   Businesses investing in high-growth assets or stocks that generate substantial capital gains will face higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   A potential alternative is to switch to Canadian stocks that pay dividends. Dividends often come with tax advantages, such as the ability to recover some tax through mechanisms like Refundable Dividend Tax On Hand (RDTOH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For example, while $50,000 from high-growth stocks would have two-thirds taxable under new rules, dividend-paying Canadian stocks could allow more tax recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

2.  **Contributing to an Individual Pension Plan (IPP)**:
    *   IPPs offer a tax-efficient retirement planning tool for [[Strategies for investors and business owners in response to tax changes | business owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Contributions are tax-deductible from corporate income, which can help offset taxable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This strategy not only reduces immediate tax liabilities but also builds a retirement fund, similar to an RRSP but with higher limits and more flexibility for succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

Both of these strategies necessitate careful planning and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

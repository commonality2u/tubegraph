Segregated funds (seg funds) are investment products commonly marketed as safe, insurance-protected investments in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. However, they are known for having some of the [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | highest fees]] in the Canadian investment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Many investors might not even realize they own a segregated fund until they are already locked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## What Are Segregated Funds?
Segregated funds combine elements of [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | mutual funds]] and life insurance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. A key feature they offer is principal protection guarantees after a set period, typically 10 or more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This perceived safety, however, comes with significant costs in fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## How Much Do Segregated Funds Cost?
The Management Expense Ratios (MERs) for segregated funds often exceed 3% annually, and some can even approach 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These fees are significantly higher than those of standard [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | mutual funds]] or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Examples of Segregated Fund MERs:
*   **RBC Emerging Markets Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund**: 2.94% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   **Manulife Global Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund**: 3.69% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

For comparison, a low-cost ETF like the iShares TSX Index ETF has a MER of just 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Impact of High Fees
High fees in segregated funds can severely erode investment returns.
For example:
*   An investment of $100,000 in a segregated fund with a 3.5% MER that earns 6% annually before fees would result in only a 2.5% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. After 20 years, this investment would grow to approximately $163,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   The same $100,000 investment in a low-cost ETF with a 0.06% MER would grow to around $317,000 over 20 years, almost double the amount of the segregated fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## How to Spot a Segregated Fund
To determine if an investment is a segregated fund, investors should review the fund's "fun facts" document for key indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>:

*   **Maturity Guarantee**: Presence of a 75% or 100% principal guarantee after 10 or 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **High MERs**: Management fees typically at or above 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning Benefits**: Inclusion of benefits for estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Early Withdrawal Penalties**: Potential for early withdrawal penalties or surrender charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

If an advisor offers a fund with these features, it is advisable to ask directly if it is a segregated fund and request full details on fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## When Do Segregated Funds Make Sense?
There are a few niche situations where segregated funds might be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>:

*   **Estate Planning**: Assets can go directly to beneficiaries, avoiding probate delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Creditor Protection**: Business owners can use segregated funds to protect assets from lawsuits or bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Pro Tip
If the primary need is for insurance benefits, a more cost-effective strategy is often to combine a term life insurance policy with investments in a low-cost ETF, which typically works out much cheaper than segregated funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

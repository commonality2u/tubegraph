This championship game aimed to determine the ultimate tax-free account champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Championship Game Recap

### Contribution Limits

The Roth IRA held an advantage in contribution limits when measured in Canadian dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As of 2025, the Roth IRA allowed contributions of $7,000 USD, which translated to approximately $9,500 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, while [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | Canada's TFSA]] limit was $7,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This gave the USA an early lead based on pure contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Flexibility

[[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | The TFSA]] demonstrated superior flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>:
*   It allows withdrawals at any time without penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   The contribution room from withdrawn amounts is reinstated the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
In contrast, the Roth IRA permits tax-free and penalty-free withdrawal of contributions at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. However, withdrawing earnings before age 59.5 can incur taxes and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This distinction solidified [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | Canada's TFSA]]'s advantage in flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Income Limits and Restrictions

[[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | The TFSA]] stands out by having no income restrictions whatsoever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The Roth IRA, on the other hand, phases out contribution eligibility for individuals who earn above certain income thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This category was won by Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Retirement Focus

The Roth IRA excelled as a retirement-focused savings vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. It offers tax-free withdrawals in retirement and provides strong incentives for qualified use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. While it may be more restrictive than the TFSA, its design is highly beneficial for long-term retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Additionally, the Roth IRA offers more options for tax-free estate planning, allowing assets to be passed to beneficiaries without tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This point went to the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Contribution Room Rollover (Overtime)

The score was tied, leading to overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | The TFSA]] secured the win with its superior rollover rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Unused contribution room in a TFSA accumulates year after year for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Furthermore, any money withdrawn from a TFSA creates new contribution room in the subsequent year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. In contrast, the Roth IRA operates on a "use it or lose it" basis for its annual room, and withdrawals do not generate new contribution space in the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This decisive advantage led to [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | Canada's TFSA]] winning the championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Tournament Awards Ceremony

In the global tax-free showdown, several accounts were recognized for their standout performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Best Retirement Focused Account:** The Roth IRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. It excels in long-term retirement savings and estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

While the Roth IRA started strong with a higher contribution limit and strong retirement focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | Canada's TFSA]] ultimately triumphed due to its total flexibility, absence of income limits, and unmatched rollover power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | The TFSA]] was crowned the best all-around tax-free account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

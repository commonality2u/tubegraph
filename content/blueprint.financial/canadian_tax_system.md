The [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | Canadian tax system]] operates on a progressive taxation model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## How Progressive Taxation Works

In a progressive tax system, higher income levels are subject to higher marginal tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, this does not mean that the *entire* income is taxed at the highest rate reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Instead, only the portion of income that falls within a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] is taxed at that higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider an individual whose current [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]] is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If their income crosses a threshold, for instance, $57,375, they would be bumped into a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]], such as 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

A common misconception is that if one's income enters a new [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]], the entire salary will be taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In the Canadian progressive system:
*   Income *below* the $57,375 threshold is still taxed at the lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* $57,375 is taxed at the new, higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

> It is always financially beneficial to receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea that a raise could result in taking home less money due to a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

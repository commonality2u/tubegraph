2025 brings several important updates to Canada's pension and retirement landscape, including changes to [[CPP enhancements and contribution updates in 2025 | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] contributions and the Old Age Security (OAS) repayment threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Understanding these adjustments is crucial for effective [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | retirement planning]] and maximizing benefits.

## CPP Contributions

The [[CPP enhancements and contribution updates in 2025 | CPP]] now operates with two levels of contributions, each with updated thresholds and rates for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Regular CPP
*   **Applicability** This applies to income up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **YMPE for 2025** The YMPE has increased to $71,200, up from $68,500 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Exemption** Contributions are calculated after a $3,500 basic exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Contribution Rate** The rate remains at 5.95% for both employees and employers, totaling 11.9% combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### CPP2 (Additional Earnings)
*   **Applicability** This second tier applies to additional earnings between the YMPE ($71,200) and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **YAMPE for 2025** The YAMPE is set at $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Contribution Rate** The rate for CPP2 is 4% for both employees and employers, totaling 8% for self-employed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Impact on Contributions
*   **Lower Earners** Individuals earning below the new YMPE of $71,200 will experience minimal or no changes in their CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Higher Earners** Those earning up to the YAMPE of $81,300 will see notable increases in their contributions due to the CPP2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. For example, someone earning $80,000 will contribute over $500 more to CPP in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Future Benefits** These higher contributions are an investment, translating into larger retirement benefits in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Repayment Threshold

The [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_for_new_canadians | Old Age Security (OAS)]] repayment threshold, also known as the "OAS clawback," has been updated for the 2024 income year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

*   **Repayment Threshold** The OAS repayment threshold for the 2024 income year is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Recovery Tax** If your net income exceeds this amount, you will need to repay part or all of your OAS pension through a recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Calculation** The repayment is calculated as 15% of the income exceeding the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Recovery Period** The recovery tax period is from July 2025 to June 2026, based on your 2024 income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Deduction Method** The OAS recovery tax is deducted monthly from your OAS payments during the specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Example of OAS Repayment
Suppose your net income for 2024 is $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Excess Income** Your excess income would be $100,000 minus the threshold of $90,995, which equals approximately $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Repayment Amount** The repayment amount would be 15% of that $9,000, resulting in about $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Impact** In this scenario, you would receive your full OAS payment minus this $1,350 during the July 2025 to June 2026 period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Age Amount Credit

For Canadians aged 65 and older, the age amount credit is a non-refundable tax credit designed to reduce federal income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

*   **Maximum Amount for 2025** The maximum age amount for the 2025 tax year is $9,286, an increase from $8,790 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Eligibility for Full Credit** You are eligible for the full credit if your net income is below $45,522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Reduction and Elimination** The credit is reduced by 15% of net income exceeding this threshold and is fully eliminated when net income reaches approximately $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

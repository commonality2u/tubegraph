Navigating healthcare costs in Canada can be challenging, but the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_canada | claim some medical expenses]] on their taxes to help offset these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide outlines common medical expenses you can claim and strategies to maximize your refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work in Canada

[[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | Claiming medical expenses]] in Canada is facilitated through the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This non-refundable credit allows Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

To claim the METC, expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For expenses for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Calculation of Eligible Claim

You can only claim the portion of medical expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. From your total eligible expenses, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

**Example**: Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,500 ($50,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,500 = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, which reduces her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Common Medical Expenses You Can Claim

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

You may claim eligible prescription drugs and medications as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements generally do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Medical marijuana is covered if you have a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase it from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: Keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Many dental and vision expenses are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. You can claim eligible expenses for services provided by licensed professionals, including dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Covered expenses**: Routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Non-qualifying expenses**: Purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> [00:03:59] **Pro Tip**: Higher-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions, for example, combining laser eye surgery with a root canal in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Medical Travel Expenses

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   This applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Eligible travel expenses**: Public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights), vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance), lodging (hotel, Airbnb), and meals (for extended stays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

> [00:05:36] **Pro Tip**: If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Always keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   This includes plans that cover medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed, as long as they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> [00:06:37] **Pro Tip**: If you're paying for a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, check which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Many medical devices and equipment qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   Some devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify; keep records of both the prescription and the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Ongoing maintenance costs, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> [00:07:47] **Pro Tip**: If you're making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it is on the CRA's list of eligible medical devices to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

Properly claiming medical expenses for a family can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows combining medical costs for your spouse and dependents, but choosing the right person to claim can maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

**Example**: Richard and Pauline, a couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), have total medical expenses of $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen (under 18): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Rob (over 18): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard and Pauline's, totaling $6,300 ($2,500 + $2,000 + $1,800) for line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

To determine who should claim the combined $6,300 on line 33099:
*   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Richard**: Earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Since Richard can get a higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [00:09:21] **Pro Tip**: Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim can maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

A common misconception among Canadians arises when an income increase pushes them into a higher federal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. For instance, if an individual receives a raise from $55,000 to $60,000 a year, they enter the next federal tax bracket in Canada, shifting from a 15% rate to 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This often leads to the mistaken belief that their entire salary will now be taxed at the higher 20.5% rate, causing concern about actually losing money despite earning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Understanding the Progressive Tax System

This perception is incorrect, as it does not reflect how the [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Canada utilizes a progressive tax system, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates. For example:
*   The first $57,375 of income is still taxed at the lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Only the amount of income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. In the $60,000 example, only the additional $2,625 is taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The remainder of the income continues to be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

This structure means that an individual's average or effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest bracket they enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

Even when moving into a higher tax bracket, individuals will still take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Earning more income is always beneficial, and common tax myths should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

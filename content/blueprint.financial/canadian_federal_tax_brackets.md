A common misconception among Canadians is that receiving a raise that pushes them into a higher [[federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]] means their entire salary will be taxed at the new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, if a raise from $55,000 to $60,000 annually moves an individual from a 15% to a 20.5% bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, they might mistakenly believe their entire income is now taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This misunderstanding can lead to the false impression that earning more money results in taking home less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How Incremental Taxation Works

Canada's tax system operates on a principle of [[incremental_taxation_in_canada | incremental taxation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:

*   **Tiered Taxation** The initial portion of income remains taxed at the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. For instance, the first $57,375 of income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Marginal Rate Application** Only the income *above* the threshold for a new bracket is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. In the example of a raise to $60,000, only the additional $2,625 beyond $57,375 would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

This means that an individual's average or effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax bracket they enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

Even when entering a higher [[federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]], individuals will still take home more money as their income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, and this common tax misconception should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

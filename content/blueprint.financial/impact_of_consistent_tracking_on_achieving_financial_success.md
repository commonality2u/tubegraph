Consistent tracking plays a crucial role in achieving financial success, much like monitoring progress in weight loss or steering a ship with a compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. A study at Michigan State University found that tracking goals makes individuals 33% more likely to achieve them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | Tracking net worth]] can completely transform financial management and help grow wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?

[[benefits_of_tracking_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] provides significant advantages for managing your finances:
*   **Correlated with Success** Research by Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania on weight loss participants showed that those who regularly tracked their diets saw significant outcomes; tracking 70% of the time led to a 10% weight loss in six months, compared to 5% for those who tracked 40% of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This principle applies directly to finances, where tracking is correlated with success towards your goals, even if not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Spot Trends and Make Smarter Decisions** By [[tracking_and_managing_investment_performance | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can identify financial trends, make informed decisions, and stay on course towards your [[setting_financial_goals_and_monitoring_progress | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Consistency Over Perfection** Similar to weight loss, [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | tracking net worth]] emphasizes consistency rather than perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics such as total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Guidance and Direction** [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is akin to steering a ship with a compass; without it, you might drift off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## How to Track Net Worth Using a Spreadsheet

A simple Google Sheet spreadsheet can make [[how_to_track_net_worth_using_a_spreadsheet | tracking net worth]] easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Setting up the spreadsheet takes about 10 to 20 minutes, and monthly updates can take as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A free spreadsheet with a visual dashboard is available for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Spreadsheet Setup and Data Entry
1.  **Download and Copy**: Obtain the Google Sheet and make a copy to save on your own computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. It's recommended to name the copy with the current year (e.g., "2025 Net Worth Tracker") and start it at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
2.  **Input Start Month and Goal**: In the "Inputs" tab, double-click to set the start month to the beginning of your current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Set your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | net worth goal]] (e.g., $1.5 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Setting a recurring monthly reminder to fill out the tracker can help maintain commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
3.  **Enter Financial Data**:
    *   **Current Assets**: Input all current assets such as cash, GICs, savings accounts (e.g., RBC checking account, Tangerine savings, PayPal, Wise prepaid Visa, CI direct savings, Well Simple cash, EQ Bank card, EQ Bank savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Consider if you have too many accounts; trimming them down to three to five can simplify tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Cars can also be included as current assets, but require depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Assets**: List registered accounts and property (e.g., TDSP, Well Simple TFSA, Well Simple RSP, Questrade LIRA, EQ Bank FHSA, house value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   **Current Liabilities**: Include credit cards, revolving lines of credit, and car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   **Long-Term Liabilities**: Add student loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Interpreting the Dashboard
Once data is entered, the dashboard provides a visual overview:
*   **Net Worth Summary**: Displays your current net worth, total assets, total liabilities, net worth goal, and the shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: Shows the progression of your net worth throughout the year, ideally a gradual increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Dips in the trend should prompt investigation into what caused them, such as market downturns affecting high-risk assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Analyzing these dips can help re-evaluate risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Asset vs. Liability Breakdown**: Provides a visual representation of your assets versus liabilities, indicating whether long-term assets or liabilities dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Detailed progress for each month, including percentage increases or decreases in net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

After filling out a year's data, create a new copy of the spreadsheet for the next year (e.g., 2026, 2027), accumulating a "balance sheet" of your net worth over time to compare performance year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This provides valuable data for [[strategies_to_increase_net_worth_using_financial_data | improving financial strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Alternative Net Worth Tracking Tools for Canadians

While the spreadsheet method offers full control and customization, several other tools are available for [[comparison_of_net_worth_tracking_tools_for_canadians | tracking net worth in Canada]]:
*   **Wetha**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. It offers convenience but locks advanced features behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Quicken (replacing Mint)**: Mint, previously a popular free option, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While Quicken offers robust financial tracking, its cost might not be justified given free alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app that helps monitor spending and manage finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

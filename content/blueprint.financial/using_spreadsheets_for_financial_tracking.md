Tracking financial goals significantly increases the likelihood of achieving them, with one study from Michigan State University suggesting it makes individuals 33% more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The act of tracking personal net worth can transform financial management and aid in wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?
Tracking net worth is comparable to tracking weight loss, where small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania showed that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets achieved better outcomes: those tracking 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This highlights that tracking, even if imperfect, correlates with achieving goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The same principle applies to finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By tracking your net worth monthly or quarterly, you can identify trends, make informed decisions, and stay on course toward your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. [[importance_of_consistency_in_financial_management | Consistency]], rather than perfection, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Tracking your net worth is like steering a ship with a compass; without it, you won't know if you're drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Using a Spreadsheet for Net Worth Tracking
A simple Google Sheet can make tracking easy and rewarding, typically taking 10 to 20 minutes to set up and only about 2 minutes to update monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This tool provides a visual dashboard to display your current net worth, net worth goal, and the shortfall needed to reach that goal, along with summary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### [[steps_to_set_up_a_net_worth_tracking_system | Steps to Set Up and Use the Spreadsheet]]
1.  **Download and Copy**: Obtain the Google Sheet tracker and make a copy for your personal storage (e.g., Google Drive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It's recommended to name the copy with the current year (e.g., "2025 net worth tracker") and start it at the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
2.  **Input Basic Information**:
    *   Go to the "inputs" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Set the start month to the beginning of your current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   Enter your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. A recurring monthly reminder can help maintain consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
3.  **Record Current Assets**: List all your current assets, such as cash, GICs, savings accounts (e.g., RBC checking, Tangerine savings, PayPal, Wise prepaid Visa, CI direct savings, Wealthsimple cash, EQ Bank card, EQ Bank savings), and even cars (though cars will need depreciation tracking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If you run out of space, simply increase the row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The spreadsheet can be used for a single person or a household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
4.  **Record Long-Term Assets**: Include registered accounts and property (e.g., TDSP, Wealthsimple TFSA, Wealthsimple RSP, Questrade LIRA, EQ Bank FHSA, house value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The spreadsheet automatically sums up current and long-term assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
5.  **Record Current Liabilities**: List debts like credit cards (e.g., RBC, CIBC), car loans, and revolving lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
6.  **Record Long-Term Liabilities**: Include student loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The spreadsheet sums up both types of liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Analyzing Your Financial Data
Once data for a month (or multiple months) is entered, the dashboard provides valuable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>:
*   **Net Worth Overview**: Displays your current net worth, total assets, total liabilities, net worth goal, and the shortfall to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: Visually tracks your net worth progression throughout the year. It helps identify dips (e.g., from April to May, as shown in an example) and allows investigation into their causes, such as market fluctuations or changes in specific asset values like RSP or LIRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Identifying such issues can prompt a re-evaluation of risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Asset vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Shows the composition of your assets and liabilities (current vs. long-term) and trends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Detailed monthly progress, showing drops or increases and their percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | Annual Comparison]]
At the end of each year, it's recommended to create a new copy of the spreadsheet, clear the data, and start tracking for the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This allows for an accumulation of financial "balance sheets" over the years, providing valuable historical data to compare performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This process offers significant value and helps track financial health monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## [[benefits_of_tracking_your_net_worth | Benefits of Spreadsheet Tracking]]
The primary benefits of using a custom spreadsheet include:
*   **Cost-Free**: It's completely free to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Full Control & Customization**: Offers complete control and is highly customizable to your specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Engagement**: Updating it monthly can be a rewarding process, keeping you engaged with your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Visual Overview**: Provides a clear visual overview of your net worth progress toward your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## [[alternative_tools_for_tracking_net_worth | Alternative Tools for Tracking Net Worth]] in Canada
While spreadsheets offer many advantages, other tools are available, each with its own costs or limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>:
*   **Wetha**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview but locks advanced features behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Quicken (formerly Mint)**: Mint, once a free and popular option in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription. While robust, its cost may outweigh the benefits given free alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Pocket Guard**: A budgeting app that monitors spending and manages finances. It offers a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

While these tools offer automation, they come with costs. A spreadsheet, on the other hand, is free and gives you full control over your tracking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

As Peter Drucker said, "What gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Tracking your net worth is a simple step that can lead to significant financial wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

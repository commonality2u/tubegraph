The [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] meltdown strategy, also known as the [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] freeze, is one of the more complex [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP withdrawal strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[11:36]</a>. It involves taking out a large loan for investment purposes, where the interest payments on the loan are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[11:46]</a>. [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | Withdrawals]] from your [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] are then used to pay the loan interest, which offsets the taxable income generated from the [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[11:51]</a>.

## How it Works

Consider Mike, a 60-year-old who has retired early with a relatively low income and a $500,000 balance in his [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[12:05]</a>.

1.  **Loan Acquisition**: Mike takes out a $100,000 investment loan at a 5% interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[12:14]</a>.
2.  **Investment**: He uses the loan to invest in a diversified portfolio, aiming for a 7% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[12:22]</a>.
3.  **[[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] Withdrawal**: Each year, Mike withdraws $5,000 from his [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] to cover the loan's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[12:27]</a>.
4.  **Tax Offset**: This $5,000 [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] withdrawal is added to his taxable income, but the $5,000 interest payment on the loan is tax deductible, offsetting the [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] withdrawal tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[12:34]</a>.

This process effectively "melts down" the [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] balance over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[12:45]</a>.

## Positives

*   **Tax Savings**: A major advantage is the potential for tax savings because the interest payments on the investment loan are tax deductible, minimizing the overall tax impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[12:54]</a>.
*   **Lower Taxed Growth**: The investments made with the loan funds grow in a non-registered account, benefiting from capital gains and dividends, which are taxed at a lower rate than regular income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[13:03]</a>.

## Downsides

*   **Market Risk**: The biggest risk is that if the investments do not perform as expected, the individual could lose money, making loan repayments a significant burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[13:14]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Risk**: Rising interest rates could significantly increase the cost of borrowing, adding further risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[13:23]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: This strategy is quite complex, involving multiple steps such as applying for a loan, managing it, and making strategic [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | withdrawals]] and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[13:31]</a>. It is not a "set it and forget it" strategy and requires careful planning, monitoring, and readiness to adjust the plan as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[13:41]</a>.

## Who is it For?

This strategy is generally *not* recommended for the vast majority of people in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[13:51]</a>. It might be suitable for someone with:
*   A very high risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[13:58]</a>
*   High passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[14:01]</a>
*   A large [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[14:03]</a>
*   Other significant retirement income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[14:06]</a>

It should only be considered if one is willing to accept potential very big losses in their [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP]] portfolio, ensuring they have a sufficiently large portfolio to cover any such losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[14:10]</a>.

[[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] tend to [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | retire earlier]] than most other groups in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A 2024 Stats Canada report revealed that Chinese immigrants aged 65 to 74 were the least likely among all immigrant groups to be working past 65 due to financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This suggests that a significant number of [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] are more financially prepared for [[retirement planning for immigrants in Canada | retirement]] or possess more options to step back from work when they choose to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Income and Pension Coverage
[[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Chinese Canadians]] have a distinctive working income trajectory that influences when and how they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. On average, [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Chinese seniors]] earn less than other demographic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Their average income is approximately $28,200, which is about 39% lower than that of white seniors, according to the CCPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

This lower average income is partly attributed to many first-generation immigrants working in small businesses or "survival jobs" that historically did not offer traditional pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Data indicates that only 39% of [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Chinese senior]] men and 35% of women have workplace pensions or RRSPs, considerably lower than the 60% to 70% among white seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Despite lower pension coverage, [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] surprisingly do not need to work longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## Role of Self-Employment
Self-employment plays a significant role in the [[retirement planning for immigrants in Canada | retirement readiness]] of [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Approximately 21% of [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese men]] and 16% of [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese women]] are self-employed, a rate higher than the Canadian average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Common self-employment sectors include restaurants, retail shops, real estate, and import/export businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. For many, [[retirement planning for immigrants in Canada | retirement]] involves transitioning the business to their children or gradually stepping back from day-to-day operations rather than abruptly quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

As self-employment typically means no company pension, many [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] build wealth through alternative methods, such as aggressive saving, property acquisition ([[home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_early_retirement_for_chinese_canadians | home ownership]]), and strategic investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Avoiding Work Out of Necessity
Individuals who continue to work past 65 out of necessity often hold more physically demanding, stressful, or underpaid jobs, such as those in retail, manufacturing, or transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. These individuals are also more likely to work full-time and earn less (25% less per hour) compared to those who work by choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] are better able to avoid this situation due to careful [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_Canada | planning]] and robust family and community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Their reliance on [[financial_habits_and_savings_rates_of_chinese_canadian_households | savings]], [[home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_early_retirement_for_chinese_canadians | home equity]], and [[family_structure_and_intergenerational_support_in_retirement_for_chinese_canadians | family support]] often supersedes the need for extended careers or substantial pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This self-reliance and strong support system contribute significantly to their ability to [[retirement_trends_and_cultural_influences_among_chinese_canadians | retire earlier]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

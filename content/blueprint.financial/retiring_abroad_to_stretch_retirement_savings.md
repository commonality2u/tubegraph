From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

A significant number of Canadians, 106,000 in 2024, have permanently left the country, often to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are choosing to [[financial_planning_for_international_retirement | retire abroad]] to stretch their savings further and achieve a better quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This article explores why and how Canadians are making this shift, covering popular destinations and crucial considerations.

## The Canadian Retirement Challenge

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives between $1,300 and $1,500 per month from CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income is often insufficient to cover basic living costs, especially in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For instance, in Toronto:
*   Average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Utilities can add $200, groceries $400, and a transit pass $150, easily pushing monthly expenses over $3,000 without home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Numbeo estimates a single person spends about $1,500 per month without rent in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Adding $2,000 for a one-bedroom puts total monthly costs at $3,500-$4,000 for a modest lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

CPP and OAS payments barely cover a third of these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This leads many Canadians to delay [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | retirement]] or seek more affordable options abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth in Toronto

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Location**: Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   **Annual Spending**: $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   **Income**: $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS; the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!danger] Outcome in Toronto
> *   By age 70, Seth drains his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
> *   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, taking over $46,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
> *   Effective tax rates creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
> *   By age 74, he's out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
> *   By age 76, his net worth turns negative, a "nightmare scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Seth's high costs in Toronto quickly depleted his savings, even with modest living, without factoring in inflation, market returns, or unexpected costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Top Countries for [[choosing_the_best_countries_for_affordable_retirement | Affordable Retirement]]

Many Canadians are moving to places where their money stretches further, allowing them to live decently on incomes like $1,300 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Mexico (Cancun)

Mexico is a top choice for Canadians seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper than in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 Canadian in savings, depending on the consulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities make visiting family convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, and private health insurance is essential as public healthcare isn't typically available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

#### Case Study: Seth in Cancun

Applying Seth's scenario to Cancun, where a single person renting a one-bedroom apartment spends about $1,700 Canadian per month total ($20,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:

> [!success] Outcome in Cancun
> *   With much lower living costs, CPP and OAS cover most expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
> *   Seth makes only small investment withdrawals, allowing his portfolio to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
> *   At age 70, he has $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
> *   At age 80, he has $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
> *   By age 90, he has over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This demonstrates the power of location in transforming a retirement from running out of money to building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal (Porto)

Portugal offers a laid-back European lifestyle with cobblestone streets, seaside sunsets, and a storybook setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Charm & Pace**: Old-world charm and a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers, and nearly year-round beach weather in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Porto and Lisbon are cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent. Residents can access the public system, and private care is affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The D7 passive income visa requires about â‚¬870 per month ($1,400 Canadian) in steady income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Farther than Mexico, but Lisbon and Porto offer direct flights to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Not "dirt cheap," but falls between Canada and Mexico in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In Porto, rent might be $1,300 per month and other expenses $1,700, totaling around $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

#### Case Study: Seth in Portugal

Seth chooses Porto, with annual spending of $36,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He has $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, covering the rest by drawing TFSA then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

> [!warning] Outcome in Portugal (Original Plan)
> *   At first, things seem manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
> *   By age 75, savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
> *   By age 80, savings are just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
> *   By age 84, the tank is empty, and he's out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Portugal gives Seth a better runway than Toronto, but $3,000 a month in expenses isn't enough to stretch his savings far enough for a long retirement (e.g., until age 90) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

#### Small Adjustments, Big Impact

By making a few smart changes, Seth's plan improves:
*   Delaying CPP to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Melting down his RRSP from age 65-69 to cover the gap, which lowers early taxes and allows CPP to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

> [!info] Outcome in Portugal (Adjusted Plan)
> *   This one move extends his savings by another two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
> *   He now runs out of money at around age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

With additional [[strategies_for_optimizing_retirement_income_for_immigrants | smart planning]], such as working an extra year, trimming spending, or exploring [[making_money_while_living_overseas | income-generating hobbies]], Seth could achieve a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Thailand

Thailand is considered one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Diversity**: Options range from the cooler mountains of Chiang Mai, beaches of Phuket, energy of Bangkok, to the chilled beach vibe of Hua Hin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Culture & Community**: Well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Many doctors speak English, and private hospitals often exceed expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Retirement visa requires being 50 years or older and showing 800,000 Thai Baht (about $33,000 Canadian) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can cost $1,200-$1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This could be a perfect fit for someone like Seth, whose $1,500/month from CPP/OAS could cover most basic needs, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay

Paraguay is an "under the radar" option gaining attention, not just for its low cost but also its tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Tax System**: Runs on a territorial tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, meaning foreign income (like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions) is *not* taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asuncion, living expenses are about $628 per month, with rent for a one-bedroom around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This means a good lifestyle for just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Offers ways to obtain a permanent residency visa with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

Paraguay represents a "financial sweet spot" due to its very low cost, tax efficiency, and simple long-term settlement process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain (Alicante)

Spain delivers a European lifestyle many retirees dream of, with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: Numbeo data for Alicante puts monthly living costs around $1,057, with one-bedroom city center rent at $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Total monthly expenses are around $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, close to some parts of Canada, but potentially cheaper than parts of Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, which requires about $40,000-$45,000 Canadian per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This is a higher bar, but achievable with careful planning, such as earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Spain offers a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### The OAS 20-Year Rule

A critical mistake some Canadians make is losing their OAS payments when they [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retire abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **In Canada**: Only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are needed to qualify for OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Outside Canada**: To continue receiving OAS payments long-term while living outside Canada, you need 20 years of Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Exception**: If you have between 10 and 20 years of residency, you might only get OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

> [!example] David's Scenario
> David, age 67, has 15 years of Canadian residency and starts collecting OAS in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. He then retires to Thailand. Six months later, his OAS stops because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and David did not meet the 20-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

It's crucial to understand these rules before moving to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This is part of the [[potential_tax_implications_of_retiring_overseas | potential tax implications of retiring overseas]].

### General Advice for Planning

*   **Research Costs**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs of rent, food, and utilities in your target country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Don't Rely Solely on CPP/OAS**: Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Consider Lifestyle Adjustments**: A [[mindset_shift_in_retirement_spending | low-cost retirement]] requires a solid plan, which may involve adjustments to your spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Be Aware of Challenges**: Life abroad isn't for everyone. Distance from family, new systems, and language barriers can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This can also impact the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_in_retirement | save or spend dilemma in retirement]].
*   **Seek Professional Guidance**: Retiring abroad involves complex tax rules and significant financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Professional assistance can help map out costs, taxes, and "what-ifs" to ensure your dream doesn't run out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

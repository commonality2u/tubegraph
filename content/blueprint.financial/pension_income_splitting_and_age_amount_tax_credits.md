Canadians have until April 30th to claim various tax credits to avoid missing out on potential savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some credits are automatically applied, many others, including those for pension income and age, require manual claims on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Strategically combining multiple credits can lead to even greater tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Age Amount Tax Credit

The Age Amount Tax Credit is a non-refundable credit available to Canadians aged 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is designed to help reduce taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

*   **Eligibility**: Individuals 65 years and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Credit Type**: Non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **2025 Maximum Claim**: Up to $9,200 of eligible income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Maximum Tax Reduction**: Can reduce taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Income Threshold**: The credit is gradually reduced if your net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   For example, if Selena is 66 years old and earns $42,000, she qualifies for the full $9,288 age amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. However, if she earns $46,000, the credit begins to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

This tax break helps retirees retain more of their income while managing their taxable income efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Pension Income Amount

Canadians receiving eligible pension income may claim a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **Eligibility**: Individuals receiving eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Credit Type**: Non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Maximum Eligible Income**: Up to $2,000 of pension income can be claimed at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Calculation**: The credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or the eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Transferability**: Any unused portion of this credit can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Retirement Tax Savings: Stacking Pension Income Amount and Age Amount

Maximizing tax savings often involves combining multiple eligible tax credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For retirees, stacking the Pension Income Amount and Age Amount credit is a common strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

*   The Pension Income Amount allows a claim on up to $2,000 of eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   The Age Amount credit, for those 65 and older, is worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Example: John and Linda

Consider John and Linda, both retired and over 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

*   They can each claim the pension income amount to reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   John also qualifies for the Age Amount Credit, providing an additional tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Stacked Savings**: The combination of the Pension Income Amount and the Age Amount leads to lower taxes and a larger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Pension Income Splitting

In addition to combining credits, [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]] is another strategy that can further enhance tax savings for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   [[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] allows couples to allocate eligible pension income between them for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   By shifting some of a higher-income spouse's pension income to a lower tax bracket spouse, it can result in significant overall tax reductions for the household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   For a full breakdown of this strategy, it's recommended to consult additional resources on [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

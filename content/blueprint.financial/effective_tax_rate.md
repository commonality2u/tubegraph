When receiving a raise, a common misconception among Canadians is that their entire salary will be taxed at a higher rate, potentially making them feel like they are losing money by earning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For instance, if an individual's salary increases from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, they might enter the next [[federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]] in Canada, moving from a 15% rate to 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this is not how the progressive tax system works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## How Progressive Taxation Works

In Canada, income is taxed progressively, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   The first portion of income is taxed at the lowest applicable rate. For example, the initial $57,375 of income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* this threshold is taxed at the higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. In the previous example, only the additional $2,625 (the amount above $57,375) would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The bulk of the income remains taxed at the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Understanding Your Effective Tax Rate

Your "average" or "effective tax rate" is the total amount of tax paid divided by your total taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Because only the highest portion of your income is taxed at the highest marginal rate, your effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest marginal rate you reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Even if you enter a higher [[federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]], you will always take home more money from a raise because your overall income has increased, and only a portion of it is subject to the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Therefore, more income is always beneficial, and tax misconceptions should not deter individuals from seeking raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

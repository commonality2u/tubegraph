Chinese households demonstrate a remarkably high savings rate, with the average household saving between 36% to over 40% of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Canada's savings rate of 6.9% and the US rate of 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The speaker, who is ethnically Chinese and grew up in Canada, notes that their family embodies the [[cultural_influences_on_saving | cultural clash]] between one of the highest saving cultures and one of the lowest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

This high savings tendency is influenced by several factors:

## Turning Deals into a Hobby

First-generation Chinese parents in Canada and the US often treat getting good deals as a competitive sport, particularly at stores like Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This behavior is not merely about being cheap, but is deeply rooted in experiences of financial scarcity where even small savings could significantly impact a family's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It's viewed as a honed survival skill and a source of pride, signifying smart financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For second-generation individuals, this can create a [[cultural_influences_on_saving | cultural clash]] between their desire to spend and their parents' focus on value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Focus on High-Earning Careers

In Chinese culture, particularly among immigrant families, money and prestige symbolize security, respect, and the opportunity to transform a family's future within a single generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Many immigrants start from scratch, working relentlessly to secure a better life for their children, making financial success essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Pursuing professions like medicine is often seen as the fastest route to elevate a family from struggling immigrants to respected professionals, providing instant credibility, respectability, and financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. While this drive can lead to significant achievements, it can also pressure children into careers they are not passionate about, leading to stress and unfulfilled lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Developing a Scarcity Mindset

A [[scarcity_mindset_and_saving | scarcity mindset and saving]] is prevalent among many Chinese people, especially immigrants, stemming from experiences of growing up with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This belief that there is never enough — whether money, opportunities, or security — often results from witnessing financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This mindset makes individuals hyper-aware of spending, always seeking deals, and planning for worst-case scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. It drives immigrant families to work tirelessly, prioritize education, and build a better life for their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. However, this mindset can also have downsides; even when financially secure, the fear of not having enough can make individuals reluctant to take risks or enjoy their earnings, leading to constant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Finding a balance between caution and optimism is crucial, recognizing when financial stability has been achieved to shift focus towards enjoying life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Strong Distaste for Debt

In contrast to North America, where spending is ingrained and debt is often seen as a necessary tool for achieving a certain standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, Chinese culture emphasizes saving with a strong aversion to debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Borrowing money is often perceived as risky or irresponsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. From a young age, individuals are taught to spend only what they have earned and saved, an approach rooted in a history of economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Being debt-free is a source of pride, reflecting financial control and a stable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This cultural difference is evident in the speaker's upbringing, where paying off credit card balances in full every month was strictly taught to avoid interest, a stark contrast to many North Americans who might only pay minimums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Zero-Based Budgeting System

The concept of a zero-based budgeting system aligns well with traditional Chinese values of careful financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This method involves meticulously planning every cent of income so that all funds are accounted for by month-end, essentially leaving a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Every part of income is assigned a purpose—bills, savings, or daily expenses—emphasizing intentionality, maximizing every penny, and avoiding unnecessary expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This system fosters discipline and careful planning, highly valued traits in Chinese culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Hating Waste

A strong aversion to waste is characteristic of Chinese culture; nothing, be it food, money, or even plastic bags, goes to waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This principle is instilled from a young age, with mandates to finish all food on one's plate and repurpose leftovers for subsequent meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. It extends beyond frugality to a sense of respect for resources, rooted in the understanding of the hard work required to obtain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Old clothes are reused for household tasks, and takeout containers are washed and repurposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. While this mindset promotes appreciation and resourcefulness, and benefits the environment, it can also be exhausting, sometimes inhibiting the desire to discard or replace items without guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Eating at Home

Eating at home is central to Chinese culture, providing both financial savings and family togetherness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Home-cooked meals are typically healthier, fresher, and significantly less expensive than dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Meal planning and home cooking are second nature in Chinese households, enabling the enjoyment of traditional dishes that might be costly or hard to find elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Leftovers are routinely saved for the next day's lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While Chinese households do dine out, it is generally reserved for special occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Eating at home strengthens cultural and family ties, offering both economic benefits and the comfort of familiar meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## The Dark Side of Saving Too Much

While saving is crucial, excessive saving can become a burden, especially when driven by fear and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. In China, many save excessively due to concerns about unexpected expenses, job loss, or societal pressure to keep up with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This overactive survival instinct often leads to sacrificing present enjoyment for future security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. There is significant [[cultural_expectations_and_mindset_affecting_chinese_canadian_early_retirement | cultural pressure]], particularly from family, to save for major expenses like weddings, homes (related to [[chinese_canadian_home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_retirement | Chinese Canadian home ownership and its impact on retirement]]), or caring for aging parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. These expectations create constant stress, as saving is not just for oneself but for the entire family's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

Furthermore, excessive saving can harm the economy by reducing the amount of money in circulation, slowing down business activity, and potentially leading to deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. A lack of trust in social safety nets like pensions or healthcare also compels many to save out of necessity or fear, resulting in ongoing anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Finding a balance between diligent saving and enjoying life is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

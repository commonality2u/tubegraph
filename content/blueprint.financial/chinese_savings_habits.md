The average Chinese household saves between 36% and over 40% of their income, meaning at least $36 is saved for every $100 earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Canada's savings rate of 6.9% and the US at just 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For individuals of Chinese ethnicity who grew up in countries like Canada, where saving money was a core household value, this creates a unique [[cultural_influence_on_financial_planning | cultural clash]] between high-saving and low-saving cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Reasons for High Chinese Savings Rates

Several key habits and mindsets contribute to the high savings rates observed in Chinese households.

### 1. Turning Getting Deals into a Hobby

Many first-generation Asian parents in Canada or the US view getting a good deal as a hobby, often frequenting places like Costco for the thrill of saving money on every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This habit often evolves into a competitive sport among siblings and friends, focusing on who secures the best deals or uses coupons most effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The motivation behind this habit is rooted in past experiences where money was tight, and even small savings made a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For them, finding good deals is not merely a habit but a honed survival skill, a source of pride demonstrating their financial astuteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This can lead to a [[cultural_influences_on_financial_decisions | cultural clash]] for second-generation individuals growing up in North America, where there's a desire to spend without guilt, navigating between brands, trends, and self-care, while their parents remain focused on value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### 2. Focus on High-Earning Careers

In Chinese culture, particularly among immigrant families, money and prestige symbolize security, respect, and the opportunity to transform a family's future in a single generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Financial success is considered essential, not optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Professions like medicine are often pushed by parents, primarily for the financial stability and societal respect they bring, rather than solely for helping others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

> "When Asian parents want their kids to be doctors helping people is like on the bottom of the list of reasons it's about the money and the prestige." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

This intense focus can lead to significant achievements, but it also pressures children into careers they may not be passionate about, highlighting the challenge of balancing personal happiness with the pursuit of status and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This [[cultural_influences_on_financial_decisions | cultural difference]] reveals contrasting views on money and success: North America often focuses on enjoying life now, while China emphasizes saving for the future and maintaining financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### 3. Developing a Scarcity Mindset

A scarcity mindset is common among many Chinese people, especially immigrants, stemming from experiences of growing up with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This is the belief that there's never enough money, opportunities, or security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. It originates from witnessing financial struggles, where every dollar counts, and there's constant worry about making ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Growing up in a formerly poor country like China makes individuals hyper-aware of spending, always hunting for deals, and planning for the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This mindset drives immigrant families to work tirelessly, prioritize education, and build a better life for their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

However, even when financially secure, the fear of not having enough can make individuals reluctant to take risks or enjoy what they've earned, leading to constant stress about a "rainy day" that might never come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The key is to find balance: being cautious and grateful while also allowing for growth and optimism, recognizing when financial stability is achieved and shifting focus to enjoying life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 4. Strong Distaste for Debt

[[Cultural perspectives on debt and waste | Money is viewed very differently in North America compared to China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. In North America, spending is ingrained in the culture, and debt is often seen as a necessary part of achieving a certain standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. In China, there's a strong aversion to debt, with borrowing money often seen as risky or irresponsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. From a young age, people are taught to spend only what they've earned and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This approach stems from a history of economic uncertainty, emphasizing financial stability and self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Being debt-free is a source of pride, reflecting financial control and a stable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### 5. Zero-Based Budgeting System

The concept of a zero-based budgeting system aligns well with traditional Chinese values of careful financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This method involves planning every cent of income so that by the end of the month, every amount is accounted for, leaving a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. It requires assigning a purpose to every part of income—for bills, savings, or daily expenses—to be intentional with money and avoid waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This budgeting method encourages discipline and careful planning, both highly valued in Chinese culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. While rigid, it's an effective way to stay on top of finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### 6. Hating Waste

[[Cultural perspectives on debt and waste | Chinese culture has a strong aversion to wasting anything]], whether it's food, money, or even plastic bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Many Asian households have separate compartments for hoarded plastic bags, and children are taught to finish their plates, with leftovers always repurposed for future meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This isn't just about being frugal but about respect for the effort put into acquiring possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Old clothes are reused for household wear, takeout containers are washed and repurposed, and even tiny food scraps are saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This mindset teaches appreciation and resourcefulness, and it is good for the environment, though it can sometimes be tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### 7. Eating at Home

Eating at home is central to Chinese culture, not only for saving money but also for bringing the family together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Cooking meals at home ensures freshness, health, and personalized preparation, often costing significantly less than eating out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Meal planning and home cooking are second nature in Chinese households, allowing families to enjoy traditional dishes that might be expensive or hard to find elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Leftovers are also crucial, frequently becoming the next day's lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While Chinese households do eat out, it's typically reserved for special occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Eating at home fosters cultural and family connection, offering both savings and the comfort of home-cooked meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## The Dark Side of Excessive Saving

While saving is crucial, it can become a burden when driven by fear and insecurity.

### Fear and Insecurity

In China, many save excessively due to fear of unexpected expenses, job loss, or pressure to keep up with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This "survival instinct on overdrive" often leads to sacrificing present enjoyment for future security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. There's also immense cultural pressure, especially from family, to save for major expenses like weddings, homes, or caring for aging parents, creating constant stress as saving impacts the entire family's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This contributes to the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save or spend dilemma]].

### Economic Impact

Excessive saving can harm the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. When people save too much and spend less, it reduces the amount of money in circulation, slowing down business activity and potentially leading to deflation, which can worsen economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Lack of Trust in Social Safety Nets

A significant reason for excessive saving is a lack of trust in social safety nets like pensions or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This drives many to save out of necessity or fear, leading to ongoing anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. While saving is important, when driven by fear or pressure, it can cause significant stress and economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Finding balance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

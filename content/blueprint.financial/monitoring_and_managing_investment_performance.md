After establishing an investment philosophy, determining contribution amounts, choosing investments, and selecting appropriate accounts, the final step in the investment framework is to buy the investments and then track their performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:10">[08:08:10]</a>. Consistent monitoring and management are crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

## Monitoring Your Investments

Analyzing the performance of your portfolio is important to ensure you remain on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:52">[09:34:52]</a>.

*   **Compare to Benchmarks**
    *   Compare your returns to benchmarks like the S&P 500 to see how your investments stack up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing**
    *   If one part of your portfolio, such as an individual stock, has grown significantly more than others, it might be time to rebalance. This helps keep things aligned with your goals and reduces [[risk_management_in_investments | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Check for Fees and Taxes**
    *   Always check for sneaky fees or taxes, as they can quietly chip away at your returns if not monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

## Tracking and Analyzing Your Net Worth

[[tracking_and_analyzing_your_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is an excellent way to gauge overall financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

*   **Calculation**: Simply add up everything you own (investments, savings, property) and subtract what you owe (loans, credit card debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   **Motivation**: Watching this number grow over time is highly motivating and provides a big-picture view of your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. A free net worth tracker can be downloaded from the speaker's website to simplify this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

## Consistency in Reviewing

Consistency is key in [[reviewing_and_optimizing_investments | reviewing and optimizing investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. Whether you check your investments monthly, quarterly, or annually, pick a schedule that works for you and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

*   **Monthly**: Good for staying on top of things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   **Quarterly**: Suitable for more stable portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Annually**: Fine for passive, long-term investing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## Learning from Mistakes

Mistakes are a part of investing, whether it's panic selling during a market dip or staying in cash too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. The important thing is to learn from these moments, adjust your strategy, focus on your long-term [[importance_of_setting_investment_goals | goals]], and avoid letting short-term emotions derail you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. The more you learn, the better you'll get at sticking to your game plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

## When to Consider Professional Help

While many people can manage their investments themselves, life can get busy, or desired results may not be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. In such cases, hiring a portfolio manager can be a valuable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

*   **Finding an Unbiased Expert**: Look for someone unbiased who isn't just selling products for high commissions, but is focused on helping you grow your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Costs and Services**: There will be a cost to manage assets, but this often includes personalized management, strategy, and planning towards reaching your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **Interviewing**: Interview several portfolio managers to ensure their approach aligns with your investment philosophy and ask detailed questions about fees and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

Whether you manage your investments yourself or hire someone, the key is to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.

The traditional notion of retiring at 65, which worked when most people did not live past 75, is no longer viable for many Canadians. Today, individuals may live 30 or more years in retirement, necessitating a different approach to financial planning to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is a primary driver behind the increasing trend of Canadians working past the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## A Longer Lifespan
Increased longevity is a significant factor reshaping retirement. While good news, it profoundly impacts retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy is not fixed; it actually increases the older an individual gets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is because by reaching an older age, an individual has already bypassed many high-risk activities and random risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Current life expectancies based on age include:
*   At age 40: Men can expect to live to 78, and women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   At age 50: Men are projected to live to 79, and women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   At age 60: Men are estimated to live to 80.5, and women to 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   At age 70: Men can expect to live to 83.2, and women to 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

For a healthy individual reaching age 65, there are likely two or more decades ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means retirement is no longer a 10-year plan, but a 20 to 30-year lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Implications for Retirement Planning
A longer retirement means:
*   **More Years to Fund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>: There is an increased need for financial resources to sustain a longer period without employment income.
*   **More Health to Manage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>: Extended lifespans often come with increasing [[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirees | healthcare costs]] that need to be factored into a retirement budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **More Time for Purpose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>: Individuals have more time to determine what they want to do with their lives when work is no longer the central focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The [[impact_of_age_on_retirement_spending_patterns | financial implications]] of longer life expectancy are significant. For example, a single 65-year-old aiming for a $50,000 annual spending target with $500,000 in savings (RRSP and TFSA combined) would likely run out of money by age 83 if they retired immediately and started collecting CPP and OAS at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This highlights that even substantial savings may be insufficient without a robust plan to cover potentially 25 or more years of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Trend of Later Retirement
Mirroring the increase in life expectancy, Canadians are progressively retiring later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   In 1997, the average retirement age was 60.9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   By 2010, it increased to 62.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   In 2020, it reached 64.3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   As of 2024, the average retirement age has climbed to 65.3, the highest in nearly half a century, representing a four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The median retirement age is now over 65, indicating that more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This trend is not solely due to [[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | financial necessity]]; in 2022, 12% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were working by choice to remain active and connected, while 9% worked out of [[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | financial necessity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Changing Nature of Retirement
The concept of retirement is also evolving. It's less of a definitive "cliff" at 65 and more of a "ramp," involving a gradual transition into more flexible and personally fulfilling work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This perspective aligns with individuals living longer, healthier lives, and wishing to maintain mental engagement and social connections often provided by work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Delaying retirement or continuing part-time work allows individuals to build a larger financial buffer, potentially out of a desire for peace of mind rather than strict necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. However, time is considered a most valuable asset in retirement, and the goal should be to retire as early as safely possible to enjoy more healthy years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Effective financial planning, including the strategic timing of CPP/OAS and smart withdrawal strategies, can make a substantial difference in achieving a sustainable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

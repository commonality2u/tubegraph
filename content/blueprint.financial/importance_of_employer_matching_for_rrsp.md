Employer matching for a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is considered "free money" and should not be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It is a crucial factor when prioritizing which accounts to contribute to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Why Prioritize Employer Matching?
If an employer offers RRSP matching, it is one of the "very important exceptions" to the general savings order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. It should be prioritized early in your investment strategy because it allows you to take advantage of free employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Maximizing RRSP matching is highly recommended if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This account type ranks second in the overall priority for investing, following only the RDSP for those who qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Benefits of Employer Matching
Employer matching offers significant advantages for growing retirement savings:
*   **Instant Return** If an employer matches 50% of contributions up to $1,500, contributing $3,000 results in an instant 50% return on your contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Faster Growth** Employer matching helps grow retirement savings more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Savings Discipline** It can also instill discipline in your savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Overall Account Prioritization
While the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is generally recommended first for first-time home buyers due to its tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals, and the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is often suggested for flexibility, employer-matched RRSPs take precedence over both due to the "free money" advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The RRSP is particularly beneficial for higher-income earners who can utilize the tax deductions to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

Canadians often face high tax rates, which can exceed 50% in the highest tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. One of the key strategies to reduce your tax burden is by [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing tax deductions and credits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. These directly reduce your taxable income or your overall tax bill, putting more money back into your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## How Deductions and Credits Work
Deductions lower your taxable income, while credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe. Knowing which ones apply to your situation can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Specific Deductions and Credits

### Child Care Expenses
You can [[basic_tax_deductions_for_small_businesses_in_canada | deduct]] eligible child care expenses to lower your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>:
*   For children under seven: Up to $7,997 per child annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   For children aged seven to sixteen: Up to $6,744 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Moving Expenses
If you relocate at least 40 km closer to a new job or school, you may [[lesser_known_tax_deductions_in_canada | deduct]] moving expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Eligible expenses include transportation, storage, and temporary living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Example:** If you have $10,000 in moving expenses and are in a 30% tax bracket, you could save $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Medical Expenses
You can [[how_to_claim_medical_expenses_on_taxes_in_canada | claim medical expenses]] that exceed the lesser of 3% of your net income or a set threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. For 2025, this threshold is $2,833 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Example:** If your net income is $60,000 (3% is $1,800), and you have $5,000 in medical expenses, you can claim $3,200 ($5,000 - $1,800) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. With a 15% federal tax credit rate, this results in $480 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### First Home Savings Account (FHSA) Contribution
The new FHSA combines the [[tax_credits_and_benefits_available_in_canada | tax benefits]] of a TFSA and an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. It's an effective tool for income splitting and offers a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **How it works:** A higher-income partner can gift money to a lower-income partner, who contributes to their FHSA, gaining a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Example:** If Jerry gives $8,000 to Elaine, and Elaine contributes it to her FHSA, she gets a $2,400 tax deduction, saving the couple $2,532 in total taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The investments grow tax-free within the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This is effective due to immediate tax savings, tax-free growth, and the flexibility to roll it into an RSP if not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Spousal RSP Contributions
[[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada | Spousal RSPs]] allow the higher-income partner to contribute to the lower-income spouse's account, deferring taxes and balancing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Example:** Jerry contributes $12,000 to Elaine's RSP, reducing his taxable income by $4,200. When Elaine withdraws the funds at a 20% tax rate in retirement, they save $1,800 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip:** Avoid early withdrawals within three years of contribution to prevent attribution back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Tax Credits for Retirees
Retirees can significantly lower their tax bills with specific [[retirement_tax_credits_in_canada | tax credits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>:
*   **Age Amount Credit:** Canadians aged 65 or older can claim an additional $9,928 as a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This credit begins to phase out for incomes exceeding $44,355 and phases out entirely at higher income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Credit:** Up to $2,000 of eligible pension income can be claimed, offering a federal tax credit of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This applies to RIF withdrawals or employer pensions but not CPP or OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Mara, age 67, with a taxable income of $40,000, can reduce her taxable income by claiming the age amount credit ($9,928) and the pension income credit ($2,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Business Expenses for Self-Employed Individuals
Being self-employed offers significant tax-saving opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Many business costs are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Eligible expenses:** Office supplies, marketing, business travel, professional fees, and a portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Example:** If you earn $80,000 a year but claim $20,000 in [[basic_tax_deductions_for_small_businesses_in_canada | business expenses]], your taxable income drops to $60,000. At a 30% tax rate, this results in $6,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This is why a dollar of self-employed income is often considered more valuable than employee income due to the tax write-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Home Office Deductions
If you work from home, you can claim a percentage of household expenses like rent, utilities, and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The percentage is based on the space used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Example:** If your home office is 10% of your home and annual household expenses total $30,000, you can claim $3,000 as a deduction, saving $900 at a 30% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### Hiring Family Members
As part of [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_business_owners_in_canada | self-employed tax planning]], you can pay a reasonable salary to a spouse or family member who helps with your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This shifts income to someone in a lower tax bracket, saving the family money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Example:** If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 at a 20% tax rate, your taxable income drops to $70,000. This results in $10,500 in savings for you, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes on their income, leading to a net family tax savings of $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Important Note:** The salary paid must be reasonable, as the CRA is strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

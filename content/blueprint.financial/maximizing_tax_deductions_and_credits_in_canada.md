Canadians face high tax rates, potentially reaching over 50% in the highest tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A key strategy for tax savings involves [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing tax deductions and credits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Deductions and tax credits directly reduce your tax bill or taxable income, allowing you to keep more of your earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Understanding Deductions and Credits
[[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | Maximizing deductions and tax credits]] is like finding hidden treasures in your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Knowing which ones to claim can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Key Deductions

*   **Child Care Expenses**
    You can deduct eligible child care expenses to lower your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   For children under 7, you can claim up to $7,997 per child annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   For children aged 7 to 16, the amount is up to $6,744 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

*   **Moving Expenses**
    If you relocate at least 40 km closer to a new job or school, you may deduct moving expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Eligible expenses include transportation, storage, and temporary living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. For example, if you have $10,000 in moving expenses and are in a 30% tax bracket, you could save $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Key Tax Credits

*   **[[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | Medical Expense Tax Credits]]**
    You can claim [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expenses]] that exceed the lesser of 3% of your net income or a set threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. For 2025, this threshold is $2,833 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. If your net income is $60,000, 3% is $1,800, making any expenses over this amount eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. For instance, $5,000 in [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expenses]] could result in claiming $3,200, leading to $480 in tax savings with a 15% federal tax credit rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Tax Credits for Retirees**
    Retirees can significantly lower their tax bills with specific credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   **Age Amount Credit:** Canadians age 65 or older can claim an additional $9,928 as a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This credit begins to phase out for incomes exceeding $44,335 and phases out entirely at higher income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
    *   **Pension Income Credit:** Up to $2,000 of eligible pension income can be claimed, offering a federal tax credit of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. This credit applies to income sources like RRIF withdrawals or employer pensions, but not CPP or OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

    For example, a 67-year-old with a $40,000 taxable income claiming the age amount credit ($9,928) and the pension income credit ($2,000) can reduce her taxable income by $11,928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_canadians | Tax Strategies for Self-Employed Canadians]]
Being self-employed offers significant opportunities for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, including for gig economy workers like Uber drivers or DoorDash deliverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

*   **Claiming Business Expenses**
    Many costs associated with running a business are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. This includes office supplies, marketing, business travel, professional fees, and a portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. If you earn $80,000 but claim $20,000 in business expenses, your taxable income drops to $60,000, saving $6,000 in taxes at a 30% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. A dollar of self-employed income is often considered more valuable than employee income due to these tax write-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

*   **Home Office Deductions**
    If you work from home, you can claim a percentage of household expenses like rent, utilities, and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This percentage is based on the space used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. For example, if your home office is 10% of your home and annual household expenses are $30,000, you could deduct $3,000, saving $900 at a 30% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

*   **Hiring a Family Member**
    Paying a reasonable salary to a spouse or family member who helps with your business can shift income to someone in a lower tax bracket, saving your family money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. If you earn $100,000 (35% tax rate) and pay your spouse $30,000 (20% tax rate), your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This could result in $10,500 in savings for you, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes, leading to a net family tax savings of $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. It's crucial for the salary to be reasonable, as the CRA is strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

There are many other [[key_canadian_tax_credits_and_benefits | tax credits and deductions]] available, which can be researched on the CRA website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

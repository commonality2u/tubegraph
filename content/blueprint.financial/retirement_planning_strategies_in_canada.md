Determining the amount of money needed for retirement is a common question, and the answer largely depends on an individual's unique situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This article explores common [[strategies for effective retirement planning | strategies for effective retirement planning]] used by Canadians to determine their target retirement number.

## The Importance of Proper Retirement Planning

A failed retirement can lead to significant challenges, such as struggling to cover essential expenses like housing, healthcare, and daily living costs, and losing financial independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The primary goal of [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | financial planning for Canadian retirees]] is to avoid the "risk of ruin," which means running out of money before the end of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This can limit one's ability to enjoy life, travel, handle emergencies, and may result in becoming a burden on family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Case Study: Vincent's Failed Retirement

Vincent retired at age 60 with $400,000 in savings, planning to withdraw $40,000 annually, expecting his investments to grow and his savings to last 15 years before relying on government pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Year 1**: Started with $400,000, withdrew $40,000, leaving $360,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Year 5**: Savings dwindled to $200,000 due to withdrawals, minor investment losses instead of expected gains, and an unexpected $50,000 home repair expense, leaving him with $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Year 10**: Savings were completely depleted to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Current Situation**: His annual expenses remained $40,000, but his income from CPP and OAS only covered $25,000, leaving him with a $15,000 annual shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Common Retirement Planning Strategies

Canadians often employ several [[strategies for financial planning in retirement | strategies for financial planning in retirement]], ranging from the very simple to the highly detailed.

### 1. The "Do Nothing" Retirement Strategy

This unrecommended approach is a sad reality for many Canadians, with a shocking number not planning for retirement at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Over half (52%) of Canadians feel they are behind on their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Most shockingly, 20% of those aged 55 to 64 have no money set aside for retirement, meaning they will likely retire with nearly $0 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This "ostrich head in the sand method" involves ignoring the problem and hoping it resolves itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Ignoring retirement planning can lead to working beyond the desired retirement age or relying on minimal government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 2. Rules of Thumb

Rules of thumb provide a good starting point for [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement planning for Canadian expats]] and residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   **Age-Based Savings Target**:
    *   By age 30: 1x current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
    *   By age 40: 3x current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    *   By age 50: 6x current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
    *   By retirement age: 8-10x current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
    *   *Example*: A person earning $60,000/year should have $60,000 saved by age 30, $180,000 by age 40, and $480,000 by age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   **The 4% Rule**: This rule suggests withdrawing 4% of retirement savings annually without running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For example, $1 million saved allows for $40,000 annual withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Vincent's 10% withdrawal rate in the earlier example was much higher, contributing to his savings depletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income**: A common rule is to aim for 70-80% of pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Blueprint Financial prefers 80-90% as a starting point to account for surprise expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For instance, a $100,000 pre-retirement income would ideally translate to $80,000-$90,000 annual retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

*   **Household Expenditure Statistics (Stats Canada 2021)**:
    *   Average expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older: ~$61,800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Average expenditure for those aged 40 to 54: ~$120,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   This suggests expenses typically drop significantly by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Blueprint Financial observes retirees spending $3,000-$7,000 per month for singles and $5,000-$9,000 per month for couples, depending on lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Pros of Rules of Thumb**:
    *   **Simplicity**: Straightforward and easy to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **Quick Estimates**: Provide a rapid idea of savings needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Rough Guideline**: Offer a starting point for planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

*   **Cons of Rules of Thumb**:
    *   **Oversimplification**: Do not account for personal circumstances, inflation, or unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **Risk of Running Out of Money**: Relying solely on these can lead to shortfalls if expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   **Lack of Flexibility**: Do not adapt well to lifestyle or financial situation changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### 3. Online Retirement Calculators

Many online calculators can help determine retirement needs in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

*   **Examples**:
    *   **canada.ca Retirement Calculator**: Provided by the government, very thorough and considers many factors, but can be cumbersome and time-consuming (around 30 minutes to fill out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   **Well Simple Retirement Calculator**: Easy to use with a clean interface and quick to fill out, but may lack detail compared to more comprehensive tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   **Sun Life Retirement Calculator**: Balances ease of use with a fair amount of detail, serving as a good middle-ground option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

*   **How They Work**: Users input their age, income, savings, planned retirement age, and expected expenses, and the calculator estimates retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

*   **Pros of Online Calculators**:
    *   **Accessibility**: Easy to find and use online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
    *   **Quick Estimates**: Provide a fast snapshot of retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   **Basic Guidance**: Offer fundamental advice on achieving retirement goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

*   **Cons of Online Calculators**:
    *   **Lack of Detailed Analysis**: Some may not offer the depth required for comprehensive planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **User Experience**: Tools like canada.ca's can be cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   **Assumptions**: Often rely on assumptions that may not fit personal situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Limited Scope**: Might not consider factors such as [[tax_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | tax planning for retirement in Canada]] implications, healthcare costs, or lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   **User Error**: Incorrect input due to lack of financial knowledge can lead to false confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### 4. Comprehensive Financial Planning

For the most thorough approach, hiring a fee-for-service financial planner to use planning software to simulate scenarios is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Retirement planning is like solving a complex math problem with many variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Blueprint Financial outlines a six-step process for creating custom financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

*   **Step 1: Initial Consultation**: A one-on-one video consultation to understand financial goals, current situation, retirement aspirations, risk tolerance, and specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This step is crucial for tailoring the plan to unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Step 2: Detailed Data Collection**: Gathering specific financial data, focusing on Canadian details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This includes:
    *   Income and expenses (detailed review of cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   Savings and investments (TFSA, RRSP, other accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   Debts and liabilities (mortgage, credit card debt, loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
    *   Government benefits (Canada Pension Plan - CPP, Old Age Security - OAS entitlements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   Employer pensions (Company pension plans, Registered Pension Plans - RPPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   Expected retirement age and desired retirement lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Step 3: Develop Comprehensive Financial Strategy**: Creating a tailored strategy using collected data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This includes:
    *   **Tax Optimization**: Optimizing TFSA and RRSP contributions/withdrawals to minimize taxes and maximize retirement income; considering income splitting and pension income credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   **Investment Management**: Creating diversified portfolios with Canadian and international assets, especially if the current [[investment strategies for beginners in Canada | investment strategies for beginners in Canada]] are underperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   **Retirement Expense Planning**: Considering different phases of retirement spending: higher spending initially (e.g., travel), moderate spending in middle years, and minimal spending in later years (except for potential healthcare cost increases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   **Government Benefits Integration**: Strategically planning when to take CPP and OAS to maximize benefits, considering early retirement reductions and deferral increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
    *   **Estate Plan**: Ensuring asset distribution according to wishes, including wills and tax implications of RSP/RIF withdrawals upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Step 4: Stress Testing**: Modeling different scenarios to account for challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This includes:
    *   Market volatility (downturns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
    *   Longevity (living longer than expected) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
    *   Inflation (rising costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
    *   Unexpected major expenses (home repairs, family support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **Step 5: Implementation Assistance**: Helping set up investment accounts, adjusting savings plans, and working with other professionals like tax advisors or estate planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Step 6: Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustments**: Retirement planning is not a one-time event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Regular reviews and adjustments are made based on life or financial situation changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This method aims for at least a 10x return on investment (ROI) for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. One client saw their combined estate after tax increase from $8.5 million to $9.4 million after implementing strategies, a gain of almost $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

*   **Pros of Comprehensive Financial Planning**:
    *   **Customization**: Tailored to specific needs and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
    *   **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects of financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
    *   **Adaptable**: Adjusts to changing circumstances and plans for many different scenarios and [[strategies for increasing income and net worth in Canada | strategies for increasing income and net worth in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

*   **Cons of Comprehensive Financial Planning**:
    *   **Complexity**: Can be more complex and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
    *   **Cost**: Professional services come with fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
    *   **Assumptions**: Still based on assumptions, and unforeseen negative events (job loss, investment downturns) can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

Despite these cons, the detailed approach is considered the best way to determine retirement needs due to its scenario planning and stress testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. It greatly reduces uncertainty and provides peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## How Much Do Canadians Actually Retire With?

There isn't a single "magic dollar amount" for Canadians to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The required amount depends on lifestyle and desired retirement quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

*   Some retirees manage with $500,000 in low-cost areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   Others, especially in higher-cost areas, need at least $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   Lavish spenders may require several million dollars and still come close to depleting their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

Understanding individual needs and planning accordingly, while factoring in wiggle room for unexpected circumstances, is crucial to address the [[challenges_of_retirement_income_in_canada | challenges of retirement income in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. For [[strategies_for_wealthy_canadians | strategies for wealthy Canadians]] and others seeking a detailed, personalized retirement plan, working with financial planners is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

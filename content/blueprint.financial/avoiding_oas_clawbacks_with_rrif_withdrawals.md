Large Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) withdrawals can increase your taxable income, potentially pushing it above the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback threshold, which can reduce your OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. As of 2024, this threshold is approximately $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

To prevent or reduce the [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]], it's beneficial to coordinate your RRIF withdrawals with other income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Minimize OAS Clawback

A key strategy for [[tax_minimization_strategies_for_rrif_withdrawals | RRIF tax minimization]] is to balance RRIF withdrawals with tax-free income sources, thereby managing your overall taxable income and preventing OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. A mix of taxable and tax-free income can help maximize your after-tax retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

### Using TFSA to Supplement Income

[[using_tfsa_to_reduce_taxable_income_and_prevent_oas_clawback | Utilizing Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) withdrawals]] can help keep your taxable income below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: David, aged 72, withdraws $20,000 annually from his $200,000 RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. By supplementing his income with TFSA withdrawals, he manages to keep his taxable income below the clawback threshold, thereby preserving his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

### Coordination with Other Income

Coordinate your RRIF withdrawals with Canada Pension Plan (CPP), OAS, TFSAs, and other accounts to manage taxes and prevent OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. This ensures a balanced approach to income generation in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.

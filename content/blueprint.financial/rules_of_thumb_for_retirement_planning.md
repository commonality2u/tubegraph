Rules of thumb offer a simple starting point for [[importance_of_retirement_planning | retirement planning]] and determining how much money is needed for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. These methods provide quick estimates and guidelines for how to begin planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Common Rules of Thumb

### Age-Based Savings Target
This method suggests specific savings milestones based on age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>:
*   By age 30: Aim to have one year of your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   By age 40: Aim to have three times your salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
*   By age 50: Aim to have six times your salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   By retirement age: Aim to have between 8 to 10 times your salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

**Example**: If you earn $60,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>:
*   By age 30: $60,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>
*   By age 40: $180,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>
*   By age 50: $480,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>

### The 4% Rule
This rule suggests that you can withdraw 4% of your retirement savings each year without running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
**Example**: If you have $1 million saved, you can withdraw $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.
A 4% withdrawal rate provides a buffer in case investments do not perform as well as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

### Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income
A common rule of thumb is to aim for 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. However, it is often preferred to plan for 80% to 90% as a starting point to account for surprise expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
**Example**: If you earn $100,000 a year before retirement, plan for an annual retirement income of $80,000 to $90,000 to cover your expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

### Household Expenditure Statistics
According to Stats Canada data from 2021, the average expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was around $61,800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. For those aged 40 to 54, that number was significantly higher at $120,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This suggests that expenses typically drop significantly by the time one reaches retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Financial professionals often observe the following monthly spending patterns for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>:
*   **Single people**: Around $3,000 to $7,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   **Couples**: Around $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
These figures depend on the desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

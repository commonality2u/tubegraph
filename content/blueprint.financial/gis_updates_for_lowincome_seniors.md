The [[GIS benefits and the implications of retiring abroad | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] offers financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:15">[05:32:15]</a>. Understanding the [[Pension and retiree tax updates including CPP and OAS | updates]] for 2025 can help maximize benefits and save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Unified Payment Schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:95">[00:13:95]</a>
The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for [[Pension and retiree tax updates including CPP and OAS | CPP]], [[Pension and retiree tax updates including CPP and OAS | OAS]], and [[GIS benefits and the implications of retiring abroad | GIS]] in 2025, meaning recipients receive all three payments on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. These dates typically fall in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. If a payment date occurs on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

For convenience, setting up direct deposit through a "My Service Canada" account ensures timely and reliable delivery of funds compared to waiting for a mailed check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

## Cost of Living Adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>
[[GIS benefits and the implications of retiring abroad | GIS]] payments are adjusted quarterly to match changes in the [[Rising cost of living and its effect on retirees | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:40">[05:40:40]</a>.

For the January to March 2025 period, the maximum monthly [[GIS benefits and the implications of retiring abroad | GIS]] payment for a single senior remains at $1,086, as there was no CPI increase over the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:03">[05:44:03]</a>. However, over the past year (January 2024 to January 2025), [[GIS benefits and the implications of retiring abroad | GIS]] benefits have grown by 2%, helping seniors keep pace with [[Rising cost of living and its effect on retirees | rising costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:04">[05:57:04]</a>.

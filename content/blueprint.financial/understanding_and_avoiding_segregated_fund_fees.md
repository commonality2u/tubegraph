Segregated funds, often marketed as safe, insurance-protected investments, come with some of the highest fees in the Canadian investment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:06">[04:37:06]</a>. While they offer certain guarantees, their high costs and restrictions can significantly erode investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:11">[04:58:11]</a>.

## What Are Segregated Funds?
Segregated funds (or "seg funds") combine elements of [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] and life insurance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:07">[04:48:07]</a>. They offer principal protection guarantees after a set period, typically 10 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:03">[04:52:03]</a>.

## High Costs and Restrictions
The perceived safety of segregated funds comes at a massive cost in fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:11">[04:58:11]</a>.

### Management Expense Ratios (MERs)
The Management Expense Ratios (MERs) per year for segregated funds often exceed 3% and can even approach 4%, which is significantly higher than standard [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] or [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:01">[05:05:01]</a>.

### Examples of Segregated Fund MERs
*   RBC Emerging Markets Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund (a seg fund) has an MER of 2.94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:23">[05:15:23]</a>.
*   Manulife Global Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund (a seg fund) has an MER of 3.69% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:28">[05:25:28]</a>.
*   In contrast, the iShares TSX Indexed [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | ETF]] has a very low MER of just 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:41">[05:33:41]</a>.

### Impact of High Fees
Consider an investment of $100,000 in a seg fund with a 3.5% MER that earns 6% annually before fees. After fees, you would only earn 2.5% each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:03">[05:43:03]</a>. After 20 years, this investment would grow to approximately $163,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:01">[05:53:01]</a>. The same $100,000 investment in a low-cost [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | ETF]] with a 0.06% MER would grow to around $317,000 over the same period, nearly double the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:01">[05:59:01]</a>.

## How to Identify a Segregated Fund
Many investors may not realize they own a segregated fund until they are already locked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. When reviewing fund facts, look for these key indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>:

1.  **Maturity Guarantee**: Often 75% or 100% of your principal guaranteed after 10 or 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:01">[06:25:01]</a>.
2.  **High MERs**: Typically above 3% or close to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
3.  **Estate Planning Benefits**: Inclusion of benefits for estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
4.  **[[early_redemption_fees_in_mutual_funds | Early Withdrawal Penalties]]**: May have surrender charges or penalties for early withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

If an advisor offers a fund with these features, directly ask if it is a seg fund and request full details on fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## When Do Segregated Funds Make Sense?
There are a few niche cases where segregated funds might be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>:

*   **Estate Planning**: Assets can go directly to beneficiaries, avoiding probate delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **Creditor Protection**: Business owners may use seg funds to protect assets from lawsuits or bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Alternatives to Segregated Funds
For those who need insurance benefits, a more cost-effective strategy is to consider a term life insurance policy combined with a low-cost [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | ETF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This approach often works out much cheaper than segregated funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

While Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) are beneficial, they may not be sufficient for building substantial wealth in Canada. Wealthy individuals often employ additional financial tools. This article explores private equity, one such powerful [[strategies_for_financial_management_among_top_earners_in_canada | strategy rich Canadians]] use to [[strategies_for_wealth_optimization | grow and protect their money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is Private Equity?

Private equity is a high-stakes investment game, often compared to an exclusive VIP club that requires deep pockets, connections, and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It involves investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments typically include:
*   Funding startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>
*   Financing turnarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Supporting business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

Unlike traditional stocks, private equity comes with higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, it also offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit capital for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Private Equity and RRSPs

### Why Most Private Equity Can't Be in an RRSP
RRSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments, meaning they typically do not allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RRSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means that, unless a specialized structure is used, private equity investments usually need to be held outside an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### When Private Equity Can Be Held in an RRSP
Despite these restrictions, certain self-directed RRSPs provide access to private equity under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts permit investors to hold CRA-approved private equity funds, enabling them to benefit from tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Examples include:
*   The Northleaf Capital Partners private Equity Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Select private equity investments offered by Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>

While it is possible to invest in private equity through RRSPs, many private equity investments are not available within an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Downsides of Private Equity

Like any high-reward investment, private equity carries notable drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:

*   **High Fees**
    Private equity investments involve significant costs, such as management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Understanding these expenses before investing is crucial, as they can greatly diminish profits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

*   **High Risk**
    These investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell, and there is always a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For instance, many Canadian investors incurred losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture under private equity real estate, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after accumulating $67 million in losses over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

*   **Long Lockup Periods**
    Investors must be prepared to commit their funds for extended periods, typically between 5 to 10 years, before seeing any returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, a $100,000 investment might be locked up for five years before a company goes public, leading to a payout, during which time the funds are inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Private equity is not for the faint of heart, but for patient and strategic investors, it can be a powerful wealth-building tool beyond an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

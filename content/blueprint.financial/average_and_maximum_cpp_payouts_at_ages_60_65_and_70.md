The majority of Canadians are leaving money on the table when it comes to their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payouts, with the average recipient getting 40% less than the maximum possible amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Understanding CPP Payouts by Age

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, regardless of the age they start their pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payout amounts vary significantly based on the age you begin receiving benefits.

### 2024 Payout Figures

For 2024, here are the maximum and average monthly CPP amounts at different starting ages:

*   **Age 65 (Standard Age)**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
    *   Average monthly amount (as of April 2024): $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
    *   This means the average amount is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Age 60**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
    *   Average monthly amount: $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
    *   Benefits are greatly reduced if started at this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Age 70**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
    *   Average monthly amount: $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah

## [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | Factors Determining Your CPP Payouts]]

The difference in CPP payouts is primarily due to several key [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | factors determining CPP payouts]]:

*   **Contributions**: Your CPP retirement pension benefits depend heavily on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the yearly maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE), which is $68,500 for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. To receive the maximum benefit, you need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   *David's Contribution*: Had gaps in employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. His inconsistent contributions due to career changes and lower-paying jobs meant he didn't reach the same level of total contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   *Sarah's Contribution*: Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. She ensured her earnings met or exceeded the YMPE every year, maximizing her CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Average Earnings**: Your average earnings over your career also affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Higher average earnings lead to higher CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   *David's Earnings*: Had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   *Sarah's Earnings*: Consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Impact of Gaps in Earnings**: Years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The key takeaway is that the more you earn and contribute out of your paycheck to CPP, the higher your CPP benefits will eventually be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | Strategies to Increase Your CPP Payouts Towards the Maximum]]

Here are some ways to potentially move from below-average or average CPP payments to the maximum:

1.  **Work While Receiving CPP**: If you continue working and contributing to CPP up to age 70, these additional contributions earn you a Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB), which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Sarah, at 67, is still working part-time while receiving CPP. By continuing to contribute, she earns additional PRBs, increasing her monthly CPP payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
2.  **Drop-Out Provisions**: The CPP includes provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings from your calculation, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   **General Drop-out**: You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals around 8 years if you contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Child-Rearing Drop-out**: If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years from your CPP calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Disability Provisions**: If you experienced periods of disability, these can adjust your lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
3.  **Maximize Your Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career**:
    *   **Meet or Exceed the YMPE**: Aim to have your annual income meet or exceed the YMPE ($68,500 for 2024, which increases over time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
        *   *Example*: Alex started a successful online business, and the extra income helped him exceed the YMPE, increasing his CPP contributions and future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   **Seek Higher-Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career; the more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Longevity of Contributions**: Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistently high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Your CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings leads to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## [[estimating_cpp_benefits | How to Estimate Your CPP Benefits]]

There are several methods to [[estimating_cpp_benefits | estimate your CPP benefits]] for retirement:

1.  **Rule of Thumb**: CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts. Previously, it aimed to replace 25% of average work earnings, but with the new enhancement, it can replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This method is best used as a very ballpark way to gauge your number, as it can get tricky to estimate for every working year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
2.  **Using Calculators**:
    *   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator**: This comprehensive tool provides a very detailed estimate of your future CPP payment, though it can take about 30 minutes to complete and isn't the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Ativa's Calculator**: A quicker and easier-to-use option, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
3.  **Your Statement of Contributions**: This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   **Online via My Service Canada Account**: If you have an account, you can sign in (e.g., through your bank), select "CPP OAS," and scroll to the contribution section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated monthly CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   **Call CPP Directly**: You can request your statement by calling CPP directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Distinctions Regarding CPP Start Age

It's crucial to understand the difference between delaying your CPP start age and maximizing your payout based on contributions.

*   **Delaying CPP vs. Maximizing Payouts**: While delaying your CPP start age significantly increases your payout, it does not *boost* you from an average payout to a maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The factors related to contributions and earnings mentioned earlier are what truly help achieve the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate topic, often related to [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments | optimal age to start CPP payments]] and [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | financial considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement Misconceptions**: Some believe that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Generally, for most clients, it is better to delay CPP as long as possible, even if not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

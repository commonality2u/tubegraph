[[Income splitting strategies for tax savings | Income splitting]] involves shifting income from a higher-income partner to a lower-income partner to leverage lower tax brackets and achieve tax savings for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It's described as being "like sharing an umbrella in the rain," where both partners benefit by balancing the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This strategy can save thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Strategies for Income Splitting

### Using FHSA for Income Splitting

This strategy is relatively new and involves the high-income partner gifting money to the low-income partner, who then contributes to their First Home Savings Account (FHSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This avoids taxable investments and provides a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

*   **Example**: Jerry gives $8,000 to Elaine, who contributes it to her FHSA. Elaine gets a $2,400 tax deduction, and they save $2,532 in total taxes, with investments growing tax-free in the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: This strategy offers immediate tax savings, tax-free growth, and the flexibility to roll the FHSA into an RSP if it's not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It's most effective if the higher-income partner has already maximized their registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Pension Income Splitting

[[Pension income splitting for retirees | Splitting pension income]] allows couples to balance taxable income and reduce household taxes by shifting a portion of pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

*   **Eligibility Rules**:
    *   **Before age 65**: Only defined benefit pension plans (DBPs) qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   **After age 65**: Defined contribution pension plans, RIFs (Registered Retirement Income Funds), and LIFs (Life Income Funds) also qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Example**: Jerry earns $40,000 from his pension, taxed at 30%. By allocating $20,000 of it to Elaine, who is taxed at 15%, they reduce household taxes from $12,000 to $9,000, saving $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Spousal RSP Contributions

[[Income splitting with RRSPs | Spousal RSPs]] enable the higher-income partner to contribute to the lower-income spouse's account, deferring taxes and balancing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

*   **Example**: Jerry contributes $12,000 to Elaine's RSP, reducing his taxable income by $4,200. When Elaine withdraws the funds at a 20% tax rate, they save $1,800 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: Avoid early withdrawals within three years of contribution to prevent the attribution of the funds back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### CPP Income Splitting

Couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can split up to 50% of their benefits to lower their overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

*   **Example**: Jerry shifts $3,000 of his CPP income to Elaine, saving $450 in taxes by leveraging her lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Splitting Capital Losses

This strategy allows one spouse's capital losses to offset the other spouse's capital gains, using superficial loss rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   **Example**: Jerry has a $4,000 capital loss early in the year from selling stock, which offsets Elaine's $15,000 gain, saving $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: This strategy applies only to non-registered accounts and must comply with CRA rules regarding timing and holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Self-Employed Tax Planning

Being self-employed offers additional avenues for [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | tax savings]], even for gig economy workers like Uber drivers or DoorDash deliverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

### Hiring a Family Member

If a spouse or family member helps with the business, paying them a reasonable salary can shift income to someone in a lower tax bracket, resulting in overall family tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

*   **Example**: If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 at a 20% tax rate, your taxable income drops to $70,000. This saves you $10,500, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes, resulting in a net family tax savings of $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Note**: The salary paid must be reasonable; the CRA is very strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Properly calculating the amount of money needed for retirement is crucial to avoid significant [[economic_challenges_and_their_effect_on_retirement_savings | economic challenges]] later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A common question clients ask is "how much do I need to retire?", to which the answer is always that it depends on one's unique situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Failing to adequately plan for retirement can lead to a range of severe financial and personal difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Risk of Ruin: A Case Study

Consider Vincent, who retired at age 60 with $400,000 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He planned to withdraw $40,000 annually, expecting his investments to grow and his savings to last 15 years until he could rely on government pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> [!example] Vincent's Failed Retirement Plan
> *   **Year 1:** Started with $400,000, withdrew $40,000, leaving $360,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
> *   **Year 5:** Savings dropped to $200,000 after withdrawals, compounded by minor [[economic_challenges_and_their_effect_on_retirement_savings | investment losses]] instead of expected gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. An unexpected home repair expense of $50,000 further reduced his balance to $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
> *   **Year 10:** Savings were completely depleted to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
> *   **Current Situation:** With annual expenses of $40,000 and income from CPP and OAS covering only $25,000, Vincent faces a $15,000 annual shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Vincent's situation illustrates the "risk of ruin," which means running out of money before the end of one's life, leaving them unable to cover expenses and maintain their desired standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. His 10% withdrawal rate was significantly higher than the recommended 4% rule, contributing to his rapid depletion of funds, especially when investments underperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Common Challenges and Impacts

Running out of money in retirement poses severe challenges, including:
*   **Inability to Cover Essential Expenses:** Retirees may struggle to pay for housing, healthcare costs, and daily living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Loss of [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | Financial Independence]]:** Insufficient funds can lead to reliance on family or government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Lifestyle:** The ability to enjoy life, travel, or handle emergencies is severely restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Becoming a Burden:** Many individuals do not want to become a burden to their family members and loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## The "Do Nothing" Retirement Strategy

A shocking number of Canadians fail to plan or prepare for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This "ostrich head in the sand" method involves ignoring the problem and hoping it resolves itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Approximately 52% of Canadians feel they are behind on their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Even more concerning, 20% of Canadians aged 55 to 64—those very close to retirement age—have no money set aside for retirement, meaning they will likely retire with close to $0 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Ignoring retirement planning can lead to serious consequences, such as having to work well beyond the intended retirement age or relying solely on minimal government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Other Contributing Factors to Inadequate Savings

Even with some planning, relying solely on simple rules of thumb or online calculators can have downsides that contribute to inadequate savings:
*   **Oversimplification:** Rules of thumb do not account for personal circumstances, [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | inflation]], or unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Risk of Running Out of Money:** If expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform, relying solely on these rules can lead to financial shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Lack of Flexibility:** Simple methods do not adapt well to changes in lifestyle or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **User Error in Calculators:** Misinformation or a lack of financial knowledge when inputting data into online calculators can create false confidence that one is ready for retirement when they are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Calculators may also lack detailed analysis, rely on unsuitable assumptions, or have a limited scope regarding factors like [[impact_of_tax_brackets_on_retirement_savings | tax implications]], healthcare costs, or [[impact_of_age_on_retirement_spending_patterns | changes in lifestyle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Market Volatility and Unexpected Expenses:** Even well-laid plans can be challenged by [[economic_challenges_and_their_effect_on_retirement_savings | market downturns]], [[impact_of_increased_life_expectancy_on_retirement | living longer than expected]], [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | rising costs]] ([[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirees | rising cost of living and its effects on retirees]]), or major unforeseen costs like home repairs or supporting family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

Ultimately, the required retirement savings amount varies significantly based on lifestyle and desired quality of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Some retirees manage with $500,000 in low-cost areas, while others need at least $800,000 in higher-cost areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Lavish spenders may require several million dollars and still come close to depleting their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Therefore, understanding individual needs and planning accordingly, with built-in "wiggle room," is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

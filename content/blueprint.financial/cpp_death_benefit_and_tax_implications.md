The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) death benefit is a one-time lump sum payment provided to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Its purpose is to help cover immediate expenses, such as a portion of funeral costs, thereby easing the financial burden in the first few weeks after a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Amount of the CPP Death Benefit

Typically, the CPP death benefit is $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In some specific cases, this amount may be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

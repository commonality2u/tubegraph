One of the most common "silent wealth killers" is using a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) without a clear strategy or by treating it like a piggy bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Consequences of Lacking a Strategy

Without a long-term vision, thousands of dollars in potential growth can be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Specific issues include:
*   **Disrupted Compounding** Frequent withdrawals and redeposits disrupt the power of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Overcontribution Penalties** Frequent transactions can also lead to overcontribution penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Inability to Fulfill Purpose** When treated as a revolving door for cash, the TFSA cannot effectively serve its purpose as a powerful tool for tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Coordination with Other Accounts** Many individuals use their TFSA to save for a first home, unaware that better tools like the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) or the newly enhanced Home Buyers' Plan exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Unplanned Retirement Withdrawals** A common issue is the lack of coordination for TFSA and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Most people do not know what they will do with their TFSA in retirement, leading to missed opportunities for tax savings and [[Investment strategies for TFSA growth | investment growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Establishing a Clear Strategy

To succeed, individuals should set intentional goals for their TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This focus helps maintain discipline and shapes a strategy that works in conjunction with other accounts like RSPs, FHSAs, and CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

It is encouraged to ask:
*   "What exactly is my TFSA for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   "How will it fit into my overall financial plan in the future?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

Possible goals for a TFSA include:
*   Growing wealth to leave a legacy for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Supplementing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Saving for life milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

By treating the TFSA as a "fortress for your future," individuals can avoid this silent killer and unlock its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

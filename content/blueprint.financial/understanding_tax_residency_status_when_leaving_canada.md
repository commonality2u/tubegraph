When preparing to leave Canada, a critical step is to properly understand and establish your tax residency status. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected tax obligations, as Canada taxes individuals based on their residency, not just their citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If you do not clearly establish your residency status when departing, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) may still consider you a Canadian tax resident, meaning you could owe taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Think of tax residency like an umbilical cord; if it's not cut properly, Canada may continue to impose tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The CRA is closely monitoring Canadians leaving the country, and one wrong move can be financially costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Types of Tax Residency Status

There are four main types of tax residency status to consider when moving countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:

*   **Factual Resident**
    This refers to someone who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties to the country, even if they are temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Immigrant**
    An individual who permanently leaves Canada and severs significant residential ties with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The CRA considers an individual an immigrant for tax purposes if they leave Canada and establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident**
    An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Non-residents do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but can be taxed on Canadian-sourced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Deemed Non-Resident**
    This status applies when you qualify as a tax resident in another country with which Canada has a tax treaty, meaning Canada won't tax you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Many people confuse the difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The key difference is how tax residency is determined and whether a tax treaty applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. However, both statuses are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Special Warning for Snowbirds

If you are a "snowbird" and spend too much time in the US (more than 183 days in a calendar year), you could be classified as a US tax resident and be subject to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Keeping track of your days is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

> ### Pro Tip
> You can track your time in the US using an app such as Day Count or Taxbird to avoid crossing the 183-day limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Mistake: Filing Form NR73

Many people assume that filing Form NR73, the residency determination form, will help confirm their non-resident status with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, this form can actually work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. When you submit NR73, a CRA official will review your case and may determine that you're still a Canadian tax resident, even if you believe you have completely cut ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This could result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### What to Do Instead

*   **Skip Form NR73**: It is not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **File a Departure Tax Return**: Report your departure date and pay any applicable exit tax. Let your actions prove non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Sever Significant Ties**: This includes selling or renting out your home, closing Canadian bank accounts, canceling provincial health insurance, and establishing tax residency in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Mistake: Not Checking Tax Treaties and Tiebreaker Rules

When [[understanding_tax_implications_and_becoming_a_nonresident | relocating from Canada]], it's crucial to understand how tax treaties affect your tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Some countries have tax treaties with Canada that include "tiebreaker rules" to determine residency when both countries can claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected and negative tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### How Tax Treaties Determine Residency

If your new country has a tax treaty with Canada, the following criteria are typically used to resolve dual residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:

1.  **Permanent Home**: Where do you have a permanent place of residence? If you have one in both countries, the next criteria is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
2.  **Center of Vital Interests**: Where are your personal and economic ties strongest? This includes factors like family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
3.  **Habitual Abode**: In which country do you habitually reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>?
4.  **Physical Presence (183-day Rule)**: Some countries automatically consider you a tax resident if you spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Example: Moving to the US

The US employs a substantial presence test to determine tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If you spend 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year, you could be considered a US tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, under the Canada-US tax treaty, tiebreaker rules can resolve dual residency situations even if you meet the substantial presence test in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If your permanent residence and center of vital interest are still in Canada, you may be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Mistake: Maintaining Significant Ties to Canada

The CRA assesses your residential ties to determine if you remain a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. If you don't properly sever these ties, you may still be taxed on your worldwide income after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Primary Residential Ties (Strongest Indicators of Residency)

*   **Home in Canada**: Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada**: If they remain, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada**: Such as children or other dependents living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Maintaining any of these ties strongly suggests you are still a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Secondary Residential Ties (May Influence Residency Status)

*   **Personal Property**: Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Social Ties**: Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Ties**: Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Canadian Documentation**: Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Mailing Address**: Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can keep you classified as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### How to Sever Residential Ties and Confirm Non-Residency

*   **Consider selling or renting out your Canadian home**: Leasing it to unrelated parties demonstrates you have left Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. [[considerations_for_selling_your_house_before_leaving_canada | Selling your house before leaving Canada]] is often recommended.
*   **Move your family abroad**: Bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Close or convert Canadian financial accounts**: Terminate accounts or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This impacts things like [[changes_to_tfsa_when_leaving_canada | your TFSA]].
*   **Update government records**: This includes changing your address, canceling your health coverage, and surrendering your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Mistake: Not Establishing Residency in a New Country Properly

Failing to secure legal residency in another country can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If you leave Canada without official tax residency status somewhere else, you may remain liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Steps to Properly Establish Residency Elsewhere

*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency**: Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Set Up Financial Ties**: Open a bank account, rent or buy a house, obtain an ID card, and register for health insurance in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in Your New Country**: Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Leaving Canada doesn't mean leaving taxes behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Without proper planning, you could end up paying thousands more than necessary or even face double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Tax law is complex, and when two tax systems are involved, it becomes exponentially harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

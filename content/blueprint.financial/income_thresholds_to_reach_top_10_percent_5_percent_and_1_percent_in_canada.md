This article breaks down the income required to be among the top 10%, 5%, and 1% of earners in [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | Canada]], based on 2022 data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These figures offer insights into [[understanding_the_top_1_income_threshold_in_canada | income distribution]] and what life looks like at different tiers of high earning.

## Top 10% Earners in Canada

### Income Thresholds (2022)
To be considered among the top 10% of individual income earners in [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | Canada]], an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
Within this group:
*   **Median Income:** $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Average Income:** $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

### Key Trends and Insights (2018-2022)
Data from 2018 to 2022 reveals several trends:
*   **Rising Entry Bar:** The threshold to enter the top 10% increased by 14.3%, from $97,000 to approximately $111,000, reflecting higher overall income levels among [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | Canada's]] top earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average:** By 2022, the average income for this group was over $50,000 higher than the median, indicating how a small number of ultra-high earners significantly influence the average, leading to greater [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | income concentration]] at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Billionaires like Jim Patterson, with an estimated net worth over $11 billion, contribute to this skew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Economic Resilience:** Despite events like the COVID-19 pandemic, top earners experienced substantial [[income_growth_versus_cost_of_living_in_canada | income growth]], remaining relatively insulated from broader economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Growing Inequality:** As both median and average incomes within the top 10% grew faster than national averages, the data suggests a continued widening of [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | income inequality in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Life as a Top 10% Earner: David's Story
David, a 37-year-old engineer in Calgary's oil and gas industry, earns around $120,000 annually, placing him in the top 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He lives with his partner and two children in a comfortable three-bedroom home and drives a hybrid SUV and a used hatchback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. David is intentional with his finances, automating contributions to his RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. His family enjoys an annual vacation, dines out, and can afford sports and music lessons for their children without financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. While still mindful of inflation, this income level provides peace of mind and financial preparedness, offering stability, flexibility, and "quiet wins" rather than constant luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. [[strategies_for_financial_management_among_top_earners_in_canada | Tracking wealth]], such as using a net worth tracker, is also a common practice among this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **High Tax Contribution:** The top 5% of earners paid an average of $87,700 in income taxes in 2022, contributing over 41% of all federal and provincial personal [[tax_brackets_in_canada | income taxes]], despite representing only 1 in 20 taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Life as a Top 5% Earner: Rachel's Story
Rachel, 45, earns $160,000 as a senior policy analyst with the federal government, placing her comfortably in [[understanding_the_top_1_income_threshold_in_canada | Canada's top 5%]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. She and her partner recently upgraded to a detached home in an Ottawa suburb, managed through dual incomes and disciplined savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Their household includes an SUV and a leased electric car through Rachel's work, providing financial ease for unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. They consistently max out their RRSPs and TFSAs, contribute to their kids' RESPs, and invest in taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
The key benefit for Rachel is lifestyle freedom: their children attend private school, they take international vacations annually (e.g., France, Japan), and enjoy weekend getaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They eat out, splurge on clothes and gifts, and have peace of mind about retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Life as a Top 1% Earner: Mark's Story
Mark, 48, runs a successful marketing agency and earns over $350,000 annually, placing him in [[understanding_the_top_1_income_threshold_in_canada | Canada's top 1%]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. He lives in a sought-after Toronto neighborhood with his partner and two children, owning a detached city home and a lakeside cottage in Muskoka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. His children attend private school and participate in competitive sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Mark occasionally travels business class on points to international destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
Financially, he maximizes his RRSPs, TFSA, and RESPs, but most of his wealth is held within a holding company invested in real estate, stocks, and private deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. He works with an advisory team quarterly to manage his finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Despite the benefits, Mark's life is demanding with a packed calendar, high business performance expectations, and complex tax considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. His "work hard, play hard" mentality allows him the freedom to work, invest, and build a lasting legacy for his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Top Earners vs. Average Canadian Income

There's a stark contrast between top earners and the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age | median income for Canadians by age group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Most Canadians have a median income between $35,000 and $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   The highest median income, for those aged 45 to 54, is still $51,500 below the top 10% threshold of $111,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The top 5% threshold ($147,100) is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Beyond Income: Building Wealth
Regardless of one's income level, it's what is done with the money that builds freedom, flexibility, and [[household_net_worth_in_canada | long-term wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The example of Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through simple, consistent investing despite not earning a high salary, underscores the importance of financial management over raw income alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

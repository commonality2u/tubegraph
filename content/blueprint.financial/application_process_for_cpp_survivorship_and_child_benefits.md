The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) can provide support to your family after your passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This includes the CPP survivorship pension and the CPP children's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Understanding the application process for these benefits is crucial to ensure your survivors receive what they are entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## CPP Survivorship Pension Application

Applying for the CPP survivorship pension is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### How to Apply
To apply, you must complete the application form available on the Government of Canada's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Step-by-step guides are available, and assistance can be sought if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Required Documents
You will need to provide supporting documents, such as the deceased spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Important Application Timing
It is crucial to apply for the survivorship pension as soon as possible after your partner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond this period could result in a loss of entitled funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is often overlooked during the grieving process, so it's important to keep in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If Emma is eligible for $700 a month in CPP survivor benefits and waits 18 months to apply after John's passing, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Applying promptly ensures you do not miss out on payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Eligibility Considerations
To qualify for the CPP survivorship pension, there are specific [[eligibility_criteria_for_cpp_survivorship_pension | eligibility criteria for CPP survivorship pension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:
*   **Relationship Status**: You must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **CPP Contributions**: The deceased must have contributed to CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for a total of at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## CPP Children's Benefit Application

If the deceased contributed to the CPP, their children may be eligible for the CPP children's benefit, which provides financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This benefit is available to both biological and adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### How to Apply
The application process for the CPP children's benefit is straightforward and similar to the CPP survivorship benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. You can apply through Service Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

### Required Documents
Supporting documents are needed, such as proof of enrollment in school if the child is between 18 and 25 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Eligibility
To qualify, the child must be under 18 years old, or between 18 and 25 years old and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## CPP Death Benefit

The [[cpp_death_benefit_and_its_implications | CPP death benefit]] is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In some cases, it can be up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This benefit helps cover immediate expenses like funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits

It is important to note that all CPP benefits mentioned, including the survivorship pension, child benefit, and the death benefit, are taxable and must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Managing finances and understanding these benefits can be challenging, especially during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Professional support is available to help navigate these complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

Many Canadians believe that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement, but it is often not enough to live comfortably, especially for those who rely heavily on these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores how much one might receive, what life on these benefits truly entails, and strategies to bridge any financial shortfalls.

## Understanding CPP and OAS Benefits

For most Canadians, retirement income comes from multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, relying solely on CPP and OAS presents unique challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
The Canada Pension Plan is determined by your lifetime earnings and contributions; higher contributions during working years result in higher payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Most individuals do not receive the maximum amount as it requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

In 2025, CPP payouts at different ages include:
*   **Starting at age 60**:
    *   Average monthly payment: approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: about $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Delaying to age 65**:
    *   Average monthly payment: $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Delaying to age 70**:
    *   Average monthly payment: $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: approximately $2,034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

A key takeaway is that taking CPP early significantly reduces your monthly payment, while waiting until age 70 can boost benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, delaying requires being able to financially afford it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. CPP is designed to replace only about 25% to 33% of your working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For strategies on how to [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | maximize your CPP benefits]], resources are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS)
The Old Age Security pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not based on employment income and is available regardless of work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and whether payments are deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

OAS maximum monthly payments as of March 2025 are:
*   Ages 65 to 74: $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Age 75 and older: $800 (a 10% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. At age 75, there is an automatic 10% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a government benefit for very low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The maximum GIS for 2024 is $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. GIS is reduced dollar-for-dollar for any additional income, meaning even small RRSP withdrawals can affect eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. OAS payments do not count towards GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Total Estimated Income
For a senior with no other income sources, a potential total monthly retirement income might be:
*   CPP: around $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   OAS: around $700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   GIS: around $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total**: Approximately $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

While qualifying for GIS could mean living on about $2,000 per month, this amount is barely above the poverty line, making reliance on CPP, OAS, and GIS alone an uncomfortable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Cost of Living Breakdown and Challenges
Living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada is technically possible but requires serious sacrifices and is generally not comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Major Expenses
*   **Housing**:
    *   If you own your home outright, costs are lower but still include property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, potentially $500+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   Renting, even in smaller cities, starts at a minimum of $1,000 per month, consuming over half of a limited income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Major cities like Toronto or Vancouver often have rents exceeding $2,000 per month for a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: With rising prices, a basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month, making eating out infrequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs**: For those under 65 without provincial coverage, private insurance may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be significant expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: Electricity, heating, internet, and phone bills are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership adds $200-$500 per month for insurance, gas, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Public transit can cost at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations
Living on these benefits means significant lifestyle limitations:
*   **No Travel Budget**: Even domestic trips would require substantial saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **No Big Purchases**: Furniture, appliances, or a new car are likely out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund**: Living month-to-month makes unexpected bills disruptive, potentially requiring reliance on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Ultimately, while survival is possible, it entails a barebones lifestyle, which makes enjoying golden years difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## When Living on CPP and OAS Might (or Might Not) Work
For most people, relying solely on CPP and OAS is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### When it Could Work
Living on CPP and OAS alone is challenging but might be possible under specific circumstances:
*   **Homeownership**: Owning a home outright eliminates mortgage or rent expenses, drastically lowering costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Homeowners also have options like borrowing against their home or downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Area**: Living in small towns or very rural parts of Canada offers more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Shared Housing**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch the budget further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Extra Support**: Help from family, additional investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant financial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree in small-town Ontario with minimal expenses could potentially make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When it Falls Apart
For most retirees, surviving on CPP and OAS alone is not sustainable:
*   **Major City Costs**: The high cost of living in major cities makes it very difficult for someone on this income to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **No Savings**: Without emergency funds, every month becomes a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement constantly worrying about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Strategies to Bridge the Gap
If CPP and OAS are insufficient, many retirees face a shortfall, but there are ways to manage it:

### Financial Optimization
*   [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delay CPP and OAS]] Payments: Benefits increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP grows by 42% and OAS by 36% by delaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Part-time Work or Delaying Retirement**: Continuing to work part-time or delaying full retirement can ensure money lasts throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**: Downsizing frees up capital for homeowners, while relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or abroad can make money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Government Benefits**: Take advantage of programs like the Allowance for the Survivor, which provides additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Spousal Planning**: Strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower tax burdens and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Creative Approaches
Many retirees with limited income are thinking outside the box:
*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of a home for short-term Airbnb stays or becoming house-sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Hobbies into Income**: Monetizing skills by teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Programs like Trusted Housesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend involves slow traveling through low-cost countries, utilizing extended tourist visas, and living for months where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   For example, one retiree in Mexico lived on about $1,500 a month, with $600 on rent, eating out daily for $10-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Others house-sit in Europe and the US to reduce living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This option is most common for active and healthy retirees in their 60s or early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Conclusion
If you are relying solely on CPP and OAS, a backup plan is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The sooner you plan, the more options you will have to address potential shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. For those still working, now is the time to create a plan to avoid sole reliance on government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

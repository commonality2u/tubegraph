This article outlines what it takes to be among the top 1% of Canadians by income and net worth, providing strategies to potentially join this elite group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Top 1% Income in Canada

As of 2021, data from Stats Canada reveals key figures for the top 1% of income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>:
*   **Median Income**: The median income for the top 1% in Canada is $378,900 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This represents the middle point of the top 1%, effectively the top 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Threshold Value**: The actual threshold to be considered in the top 1% of income earners in Canada is $271,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This is the bottom point of the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Characteristics of the Top 1% Income Earners
*   Approximately 80% of individuals in the top 1% are married or in common-law relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Wages and salaries accounted for 63.1% of their income in 2021, a slight increase from 62.7% in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This indicates that about one-third of their income comes from sources other than their primary jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Diversifying income sources is beneficial for reaching this status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

Net worth, defined as total assets minus liabilities, is considered a truer measure of wealth than income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. An individual can be in the top 1% for income but not for net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   According to a 2021 report from the PBO, the threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Roughly 6,600 families in Canada meet this criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While this figure may seem daunting, over 160,000 Canadian families have achieved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

There are several ways individuals and families in Canada accumulate significant wealth to reach the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### 1. Having a High-Paying Profession
To amass the $6.3 million net worth needed, earning an income close to the $271,500 threshold is a strong advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. [[high_paying_professions_in_canada | High-paying professions]] in Canada that can achieve this include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
*   C-Suite level Executives (CEO, CFO, CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Medical specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Partners in law firms and accounting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Investment bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Principal software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Senior data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   Specialized dentists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   Senior software architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

These roles typically require many years of specialized education and work experience, making this path challenging for those not already on the right career trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 2. Starting a Business
Business ownership is a primary avenue for the top 1% to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. While not easy, starting a successful business is possible for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The wealthiest Canadians, such as media, retail, finance, and technology tycoons, largely achieved their status through business ventures rather than 9-5 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

**Example**: Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify, propelled himself into the elite of Canadian wealth through the company's success, which made e-commerce accessible globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Business ownership provides significant financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits (selling the business or going public) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The key is "scaling," allowing businesses to reach hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Certain sales roles, like real estate agents, mortgage brokers, or pharmaceutical sales representatives, can also achieve top 1% incomes, acting as a hybrid between salary and business ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. High-performing sales professionals earn high incomes through commissions, bonuses, and incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### 3. Investing Wisely
Investing is crucial for money to compound and grow over time, enabling individuals to outpace 99% of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

**Example**: Anne Scheiber, an IRS auditor, retired with modest savings but built a $22 million fortune by investing in blue-chip stocks with solid dividends, demonstrating the power of buying and holding high-quality stocks long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

For beginner investors, diversification is a good approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Stock Market**: Index funds or ETFs with low fees offer broad diversification at low cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For more involvement, learning to pick individual stocks is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Fixed Income/Bonds**: Investing in bonds can complement stocks, providing steady growth and protection from market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: A significant and popular wealth builder for Canadians, rental properties can provide steady income and property value appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Utilize Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), and First Home Savings Accounts (FHSAs) to enhance investment returns through tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   RSP contributions are tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   TFSA investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### 4. Being Frugal and Saving Most of Your Income
Consistent saving and wise investing, even on a modest income, can lead to substantial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

**Example**: Ronald Reed, a janitor and gas station attendant, built an $8 million fortune by living frugally and consistently investing in blue-chip stocks like Proctor and Gamble, JP Morgan Chase, and General Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. He reinvested dividends, demonstrating the power of long-term investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

However, avoid "extreme frugality" if it negatively impacts quality of life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Combining Strategies

Most individuals who achieve top 1% status utilize a combination of these methods rather than just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **High-Income Earner, Low-Risk Averse**: Combine wise investing and frugality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taker, Less Frugal**: Focus on starting a scalable business and investing profits wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Family with Bills, Risk Averse**: Prioritize increasing salary through promotions or training, and then investing any excess income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

A balanced approach incorporating elements of high-paying work, business ventures, wise investing, and saving can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The best approach depends on individual lifestyle and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Having a solid financial plan is paramount for achieving the goal of being richer than 99% of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) closely monitors investments within Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) that involve non-arm's length transactions [00:06:16]. These types of transactions are considered a significant red flag for the CRA [00:06:13].

## What are Non-Arm's Length Transactions?
Non-arm's length transactions refer to investments where you, your family members, or individuals you are closely connected with have significant control or influence [00:06:21]. Such transactions can trigger serious penalties because they may be used to unfairly shift wealth into a TFSA [00:06:30].

## Activities That Trigger Penalties
The CRA flags several scenarios as non-arm's length transactions that can result in penalties:
*   **Investing in private businesses** where you or a family member have control [00:06:39].
*   **Purchasing shares in a company** where you or a relative own more than 10% [00:06:43].
*   **Structuring "friendly transactions"** designed to unfairly boost your TFSA balance [00:06:47].

## Penalties for Non-Arm's Length Transactions
If the CRA deems an investment to be non-arm's length, severe penalties can be imposed:
*   A **50% penalty** on the investment's fair market value [00:07:14].
*   A **100% tax on any future gains** derived from those shares [00:07:23].
*   A TFSA reassessment, which essentially wipes out the tax-free advantage [00:07:32].

### Case Example: The "Bobby Axelrod" Scenario
Consider a hypothetical investor, "Bobby Axelrod," who buys $50,000 worth of shares in his business partner's new startup within his TFSA, expecting massive, tax-free gains [00:06:51]. Because "Axe" has influence over the business and the transaction is not at arm's length, the CRA would likely impose a 50% penalty on the shares' fair market value, amounting to $25,000 instantly [00:07:12]. If those shares were to grow to $500,000, the CRA would take all of it, in addition to the initial penalty and a TFSA reassessment [00:07:26]. This demonstrates how the CRA effectively shuts down TFSA loopholes that could otherwise lead to large, tax-free windfalls [00:07:41].

## How to Avoid Non-Arm's Length Traps
To mitigate the risk of CRA penalties related to non-arm's length transactions, it is advisable to:
*   **Avoid investing in companies** where you or your family members have ownership or control [00:07:46].
*   **Be cautious of transactions** that could be perceived as creating artificial tax advantages [00:07:53].
*   **Exercise skepticism** if a deal within your TFSA appears "too good to be true," as the CRA is likely monitoring such activities [00:07:57].

## Connection to [[the_cra_advantage_rule_and_its_implications | The CRA Advantage Rule]]
Non-arm's length transactions are closely related to the [[the_cra_advantage_rule_and_its_implications | Advantage Rule]], an obscure rule that allows the CRA to retroactively invalidate legal investment strategies if they believe an "undue benefit" has been gained [00:02:46]. The CRA defines an advantage as any benefit or debt tied to the existence of a TFSA that falls outside normal investment activities or conventional incentive programs [00:08:14]. If the CRA determines an undue tax benefit has been gained, they can retroactively tax gains at 100% and apply significant penalties [00:08:25]. Artificial inflated returns, such as those that might arise from non-arm's length dealings, are specifically cited by the CRA as qualifying an advantage [00:08:34].

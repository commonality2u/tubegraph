Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices an individual can make, yet it is often not as simple as it seems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Over 95% of Canadians begin CPP at or before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, for many, waiting until age 70 can significantly increase lifetime benefits, potentially adding over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

The CPP decision is like a retirement jigsaw puzzle, where each piece, including life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams, must fit together to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Key Considerations for CPP Timing

The optimal CPP start age is primarily influenced by two key factors: predicted investment returns and life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 60

Choosing to start CPP at age 60 results in a 0.6% reduction in payments per month before age 65, leading to a total 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Factors that make starting at age 60 optimal include:
*   **Immediate Income Needs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>: Ideal for those who require funds immediately.
*   [[Impact of health on CPP decision | Health Concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>: Suited for individuals with shorter life expectancies.
*   **High Investment Returns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>: If personal investment funds can consistently achieve 6% or more in annual returns, investing CPP payments taken early might lead to better outcomes, albeit with higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS) Considerations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>: Starting CPP at age 60 can help low-income retirees avoid OAS clawbacks and smooth income across retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 65

Age 65 is often considered the default option, offering a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It provides steady payments and avoids the need for personal savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Considerations for starting at age 65:
*   **Life Expectancy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>: Ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy.
*   **Investment Returns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>: Suited for those with moderate estimated investment returns.
*   **Predictable Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>: Offers reliable, inflation-adjusted income without requiring extensive additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Break-even Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>: Payments tend to equalize with the age 70 option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those uncertain about their longevity or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### [[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | Delaying CPP]] to Age 70

[[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | Delaying CPP]] until age 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly benefit at 65 would jump to $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

[[Benefits of delaying CPP | Benefits of delaying CPP]] include:
*   **Highest Guaranteed Lifetime Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>: Provides the maximum possible inflation-adjusted payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Longer Life Expectancy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>: Ideal for individuals who expect to live longer, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Sufficient Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>: Requires sufficient personal savings to bridge the income gap until age 70.
*   **High Effective Return** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to approximately 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Break-even Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>: For most, [[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | delaying CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed those from earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Estimating Life Expectancy

Your life expectancy is a crucial piece of the CPP puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A 2020 [[Actuarial study on CPP timing | Actuarial study on CPP timing]] decision report highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Key takeaways on life expectancy:
*   **Gender Differences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>: Women tend to live longer than men; 82% of women are likely to live past age 80, making [[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | delaying CPP]] especially beneficial for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle and Family History** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>: A healthy lifestyle or a family history of long life increases longevity odds (79% for men, 85% for women to live past 80 in such cases), making delayed CPP a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Most Canadians Live Longer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>: Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Age and Life Expectancy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>: The older an individual is, the longer their remaining life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live to about 82, while a woman can expect to live to nearly 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### [[Methods to estimate CPP benefits | Methods to Estimate Life Expectancy]]

Several tools and methods can help refine life expectancy estimates:
*   **Online Calculators** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>: Websites like Blue Zones Vitality Compass (focuses on lifestyle habits) and Living to 100 (detailed health and habits questions) provide personalized estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Genetic Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>: Can uncover potential health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>: Identifying modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management can improve overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>: Advanced tests measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>: Regular checkups to monitor chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) that significantly impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Role of Investment Returns and Present Value

While break-even tables are a good starting point, they often fall short because they don't consider the investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

A CPP present value calculator is recommended as it incorporates these additional factors to provide a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This tool allows users to input their estimated monthly benefit at age 65, expected inflation rate (annual indexation), desired start ages for evaluation, and estimated life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The estimated rate of return on one's portfolio also significantly impacts the present value analysis, balancing the benefits of delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Additional Strategic Considerations

Effective CPP planning involves a comprehensive approach that integrates various aspects of a retiree's financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Key additional considerations include:
*   **Tax Strategies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>: Analyzing how CPP income interacts with overall tax situations to potentially reduce or increase tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>: Determining if [[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | delaying CPP]] can help avoid OAS clawbacks, or if starting earlier is a better option to manage income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>: Integrating CPP with Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) withdrawals, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

These factors demonstrate that while delaying CPP often shows benefits, individual circumstances, particularly life expectancy and financial situations, require personalized assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

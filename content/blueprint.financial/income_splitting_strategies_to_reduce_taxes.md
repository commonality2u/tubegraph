## Strategies for [[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | Income Splitting]]

### Using the FHSA for [[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | Income Splitting]]

While primarily for saving for a home, the FHSA can also assist couples in saving on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **Who it's for**: Couples where one partner has maximized their tax-advantaged accounts (such as RRSP, TFSA, FHSA) and the other has unused FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **How it works**: The higher-income partner gifts money to the lower-income partner, who then contributes it to their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This approach allows the couple to avoid investing in a taxable account, claim a tax deduction, and benefit from tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Example**: Jim gives $8,000 to Pam, who has unused FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Pam receives a $2,400 tax deduction, avoids $132 in taxes on growth, and all future growth remains tax-free, leading to a total saving of $2,532 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Spousal RRSP Contributions for [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | Income Splitting]]

Spousal RRSPs help balance retirement incomes and reduce taxes for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

*   **How it works**: The higher-income spouse contributes to the lower-income spouse's RRSP, immediately receiving a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. In retirement, the lower-income spouse withdraws the funds at their lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Example**: Jim contributes $12,000 to Pam's RRSP, which lowers Jim's taxes by $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. When Pam withdraws in retirement, she pays only $2,400 in taxes, saving the couple $1,800 overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Splitting Capital Losses

Investment losses can be converted into tax savings by transferring capital losses between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

*   **Example**: Jim's $4,000 capital loss reduces Pam's $15,000 in capital gains, saving the couple $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: This strategy is effective only in non-registered accounts, and the buyer must hold the shares for at least 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

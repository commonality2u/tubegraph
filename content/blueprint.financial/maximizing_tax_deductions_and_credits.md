Deductions and tax credits function as "hidden treasures" within a tax return, directly reducing one's tax bill or taxable income and ultimately returning more money to the individual's pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Understanding which ones to claim can be challenging but can lead to significant financial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Key Deductions and Credits

### Child Care Expenses
Eligible child care expenses can be deducted, which lowers taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   For children under 7, up to $7,997 per child annually can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   For children aged 7 to 16, up to $6,741 can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Moving Expenses
If an individual relocates at least 40 km closer to a new job or school, they can deduct moving expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Eligible expenses include transportation, storage, and temporary living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Example**: $10,000 in moving expenses for someone in a 30% tax bracket could result in $3,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### [[Medical expenses and charitable donations for tax credits | Medical Expenses]]
Medical expenses exceeding the lesser of 3% of net income or a set threshold can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. For 2025, this threshold is $2,833 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Example**: If net income is $60,000, 3% is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Any expenses over this amount are eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If an individual has $5,000 in medical expenses, they could claim $3,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, which, with a 15% federal tax credit rate, results in $480 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Other Tax Credits and Deductions
A wide range of other tax credits and deductions are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Individuals can research specific eligibility requirements via the CRA website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

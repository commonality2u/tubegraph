Tax season involves more than just paperwork; it's an opportunity to retain more of your hard-earned money. Avoiding common mistakes can significantly impact your financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Common Tax Filing Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Filing Late or Not Filing at All
Filing taxes late can result in significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Penalties:** If taxes are owed, the CRA levies a 5% penalty on the unpaid balance, plus an additional 1% per month until paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Delayed Benefits:** Even without owing taxes, late filing can delay refunds and benefits such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Increased Penalties:** Repeated late filing can lead to higher penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> To avoid penalties, set a reminder well before the April 30th deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If you anticipate owing taxes, file on time even if you can't pay immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### 2. Forgetting to Report All Income
The CRA cross-references your tax return with income records like T4s and T5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Forgetting to report employment income, rental income, side hustle earnings, or investment dividends can lead to penalties and potential audits <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Platform Reporting:** Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now report income directly to the CRA, which can trigger automatic reassessments for unreported earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Unreported Income:** If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current return and have missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a 10% penalty (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

> To avoid issues, always check your My CRA account to confirm all tax slips are included before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Keeping accurate records helps prevent costly surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### 3. Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs
Exceeding [[prioritizing_registered_accounts_for_tax_savings | RRSP]] or [[prioritizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | TFSA]] contribution limits can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Penalties:** Excess [[prioritizing_registered_accounts_for_tax_savings | RRSP]] contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty until withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[prioritizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | TFSA]] contributions also incur a 1% monthly penalty on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Common Cause:** Many taxpayers do not track their contribution room carefully and mistakenly believe the CRA will notify them of overcontributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

> Track your own contributions rather than relying solely on your My CRA account, as it may not be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If you overcontribute, withdraw the excess quickly to minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### 4. Missing Out on Deductions and Credits
Many Canadians overlook valuable tax deductions and credits that could reduce taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Commonly Missed Deductions:**
    *   [[maximizing_medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | Medical expenses]] (prescription drugs, dental treatments, travel costs for medical care) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   Moving expenses, if you relocated for work or school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   Union and professional membership dues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   Unused tuition credits for students, which can be carried forward or transferred to a parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

> Reviewing eligibility for these deductions can lead to a larger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Always keep receipts and records as proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For more information, refer to [[overlooked_cra_tax_deductions_and_credits | overlooked CRA tax deductions and credits]] and [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | maximizing tax deductions and credits in Canada]].

### 5. Claiming Ineligible Write-Offs
The CRA is strict about business and employment deductions, and incorrect claims can result in audits and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Home Office Expenses:** Deductible only if your workspace is your primary place of work or used exclusively for work-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Eligible expenses include utilities, rent, and internet for that portion of your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Business Expenses:** Deductions for meals, travel, and vehicle costs must be reasonable, directly related to earning income, and supported by receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Personal expenses disguised as business costs will be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Paying Family Members:** If you hire a spouse or child, their salary must reflect actual work performed; unjustified payments may be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 6. Forgetting to Claim Capital Losses
If you have sold investments (stocks, ETFs) or property at a loss, you may use these losses to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   The CRA allows capital losses to be carried forward indefinitely or applied to gains from the past three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Many investors miss out on these savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

> Keep track of investment transactions and report losses in the year they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Even without current gains, filing losses for future use is a valuable [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | tax-saving strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### 7. Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency
*   **Foreign Assets:** If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (stocks, real estate, offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 Foreign Asset Disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Failure to do so can lead to hefty penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency:** Cryptocurrency is on the CRA's radar, and unreported gains from selling or trading crypto can result in a tax audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Some crypto exchanges now report transactions to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

> Keep detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades and report all taxable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### 8. Overlooking Income Splitting Opportunities
[[family_tax_planning | Income splitting]] can significantly reduce a household's overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions:** A higher-earning spouse can contribute to a lower-earning spouse's [[prioritizing_registered_accounts_for_tax_savings | RRSP]] for tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting:** Retirees can split up to 50% of eligible pension income to lower their combined tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** [[prioritizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | TFSA]] and FHSA accounts are excellent for [[family_tax_planning | income splitting]] as they are not subject to income attribution rules, allowing tax-free growth of investments contributed by family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

> For more strategies, refer to guides on [[family_tax_planning | income splitting strategies to legally reduce your tax bill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### 9. Failing to Pay Installments if Required
If you owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec), the CRA may require quarterly tax installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This often applies to self-employed individuals, landlords, investors, and high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Interest Charges:** Missing payments leads to compound daily interest on unpaid amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Interest is calculated from the installment due date until the balance is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Additional Penalty:** An additional penalty may apply if your installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

> Set reminders and budget accordingly to make timely and sufficient installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This prevents unnecessary interest costs and large lump-sum tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### 10. Ignoring Tax Planning Until April
Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just a last-minute task before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Many [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | tax-saving strategies]], such as contributing to an FHSA, making [[maximizing_medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | charitable donations]], and capital loss harvesting, must be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   Waiting until April can lead to missed deductions and a frantic search for documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Business owners and investors should plan for capital gains, tax-efficient withdrawals, and [[family_tax_planning | income splitting]] throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

> Set up a tax review before year-end to optimize your [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | strategy]], reduce your tax bill, and avoid surprises when filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

One significant [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_a_tfsa | mistake]] to avoid when managing your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is taking on excessive risk with your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. This often applies to younger investors eager to achieve rapid returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Types of High-Risk Investments
High-risk investments that can lead to problems in a TFSA include:
*   Meme stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>
*   Cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>
*   Penny stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>

The appeal of these investments often lies in the hope of doubling money overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Why This Approach Backfires
Investing too aggressively in a TFSA frequently leads to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. These types of investments are characterized by extreme volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Even if an investor manages to double their money in a year, the discipline to cash out and re-invest in safer options is often lacking, leading to even greater exposure to risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. The more one gambles, the higher the chance of significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

As Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, wisely stated:
> "The big money is not in the buying and selling but but in the waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>

## Impact of Losses in a TFSA
A major drawback of high-risk investments within a TFSA is the effect of losses on your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.
*   **No Tax Claim on Losses** If a high-risk investment drops significantly (e.g., $10,000 to $5,000), the loss cannot be claimed on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Permanent Loss of Contribution Room** The contribution room associated with the lost funds is gone permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. This reduces your future tax-free growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Instead of building wealth, this creates a difficult financial setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Balancing risk with reward is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. It is acceptable to take some calculated risks, but avoid putting all your assets into highly speculative ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Slow, steady, and consistent growth is the most effective way to build substantial wealth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

Many Canadians expect to receive the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payment after decades of contributions, but most do not get anywhere near the maximum of around $2,034 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The average payment for those collecting at age 60 is approximately $530 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, representing a significant 74% drop from the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Earning a High Salary Doesn't Guarantee a Max CPP Payout

To receive the maximum CPP payout, your salary and income must be high enough to meet the maximum contribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, what qualifies as "maximum" has changed over time, and with the introduction of [[details_of_regular_cpp_and_cpp2_contributions | CPP2]], there's an additional layer of consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Beginning in 2024, CPP introduced a second earning ceiling, meaning higher income earners contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In 2024, this new second ceiling, known as the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE), is $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This is the amount you need to earn annually to be eligible for maximum CPP payments upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The maximum threshold for contributions has steadily increased over the years, making it progressively harder to reach the maximum CPP benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example:
*   In 1990, you needed to earn $28,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   In 2000, it was $37,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   In 2010, it was $47,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

What was considered a high enough salary to max out CPP in the past is insufficient today and will continue to rise, meaning younger Canadians will need even higher salaries to qualify for the maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### The Case of James

Consider James, who consistently earned at least the maximum YAMPE every year for nearly four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Despite doing everything "right" in terms of salary, if he decides to start collecting CPP at age 60, he would receive around $917 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This is less than half of the potential maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This illustrates that even high-income earners may not get anywhere near the maximum CPP if other [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | factors that affect CPP payout amounts]] are not optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Maximizing Your Salary's Impact on CPP

To optimize the impact of your salary on CPP contributions, it's crucial to earn at least the YAMPE (Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings) for as many years as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. While this is often the hardest factor to influence, increasing your income directly boosts your CPP payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Here are some strategies:
*   **Negotiate Higher Wages and Promotions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>: The more you earn, the more you can contribute to CPP.
*   **Start a Side Hustle or Business** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>: If self-employed, ensure you pay into CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Level Up Your Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>: Investing in certifications, training, or new skills can help you secure a higher-paying job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Switch Jobs Strategically** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>: Changing employers can often lead to faster salary growth than remaining in the same position for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

It's important to remember that maximizing CPP is not just about earning more; it's about making smart decisions regarding salary, timing of collection, and consistency of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These three factors — salary, timing, and consistency — act like legs of a stool, and if one is weak, the overall payout becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

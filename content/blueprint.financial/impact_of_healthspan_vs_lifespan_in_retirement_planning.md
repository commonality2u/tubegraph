The [[save_or_spend_dilemma | save or spend dilemma]] in retirement often leads individuals to hesitate spending what they've saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This hesitation can result in missed opportunities and experiences that make retirement fulfilling, such as travel, hobbies, or healthcare improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. A critical aspect of retirement planning that addresses this concern is the distinction between lifespan and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.

## Defining Lifespan and Healthspan

Dr. Peter Attia, in his book *Outlive*, highlights the crucial difference between these two terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>:
*   **Lifespan**: Refers to the total number of years an individual lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.
*   **Healthspan**: Denotes the number of years one lives in good health, being active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:12">[01:27:12]</a>.

## The Critical Distinction in Retirement

Understanding the difference between lifespan and healthspan is vital for retirement planning. Delaying spending can mean missing out on the best years of one's healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Retirees might wait until their physical abilities decline, which limits their enjoyment of the wealth they've accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of utilizing saved funds during periods of optimal health to maximize the quality of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

While caution in spending can be beneficial for [[strategies_for_extending_retirement_income | extending retirement income]] and reducing longevity and portfolio risk, the primary goal of retirement savings should also be to support a fulfilling life during the years when one can actively enjoy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:05">[02:29:05]</a>. A [[importance_of_financial_planning_for_retirement | well-structured financial plan]] can help retirees understand how much they can safely spend, allowing them to shift from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:20">[04:01:20]</a>.

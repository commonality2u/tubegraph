Many Canadians mistakenly believe that if a salary increase pushes them into a higher tax bracket, their entire income will be taxed at the new, higher rate, potentially leading to them taking home less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. For example, a raise from $55,000 to $60,000 a year in Canada could move an individual into the next federal tax bracket, from 15% to 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, this is a misunderstanding of how the tax system operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Understanding Marginal Tax Rates

Canada's tax system uses marginal tax rates, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates. For instance, the first $57,375 of an individual's income is still taxed at the lower rate of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Only the portion of income that *exceeds* the previous bracket's threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. So, if a person's income increases to $60,000, only the additional $2,625 (the amount above $57,375) would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This system ensures that your average or effective tax rate remains significantly lower than the highest marginal rate you reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, even if you move into a higher tax bracket, you will still take home more money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Benefits of Earning More

More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The [[impact_of_salary_raise_on_taxes | impact of a salary raise on taxes]] does not result in a net loss of income. Misconceptions about tax brackets should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

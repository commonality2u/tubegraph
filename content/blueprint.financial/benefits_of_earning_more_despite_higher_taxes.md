Many Canadians mistakenly believe that an increase in salary, which bumps them into a higher federal tax bracket, means their entire income will be taxed at the new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, a raise from $55,000 to $60,000 could theoretically move someone from a 15% to a 20.5% federal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This misunderstanding often leads to the false conclusion that earning more will result in taking home less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How Progressive Taxation Works

Canada operates on a progressive tax system, meaning different portions of your income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   The first portion of your income, up to a certain threshold (e.g., $57,375), is taxed at the lower rate (e.g., 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For instance, if your income rises to $60,000, only the additional $2,625 beyond the $57,375 threshold would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The initial $57,375 remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Effective Tax Rate

Because of the progressive nature of the tax system, your average or effective tax rate is always lower than the highest marginal tax bracket you fall into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This ensures that even when you enter a higher tax bracket, you still take home more money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Therefore, misconceptions about how taxes work should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting a salary raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

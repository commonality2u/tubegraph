Spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) contributions are a straightforward yet impactful method to distribute the tax burden during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This strategy is particularly effective for couples looking to balance their retirement incomes, especially if one partner has a workplace pension or if there's a notable age difference between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

The process involves a higher-income spouse contributing to an [[Spousal RRSP rollover and tax deferral | RRSP]] in the lower-income spouse's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

> [!INFO] Benefits
> *   **Immediate Tax Deduction:** The higher-income spouse receives an immediate tax deduction for the contribution, lowering their current taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
> *   **Future Tax Efficiency:** When the lower-income spouse withdraws funds in retirement, they are taxed at their typically lower marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This is the primary distinction of spousal RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

This approach effectively levels the playing field, allowing both partners to maximize their savings and reduce their overall household tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The core idea is to forecast which partner will have a lower income in retirement and leverage spousal RRSPs to capitalize on that fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Example: Ted and Robin's Retirement Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

[!EXAMPLE]
Consider Ted and Robin's retirement planning scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>:
*   Ted earns $120,000 annually and is taxed at 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Robin earns $40,000 annually and is taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Their goal is to equalize their retirement savings, especially since Ted has a workplace pension and Robin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The strategy is for Ted to contribute $12,000 to a spousal [[Spousal RRSP rollover and tax deferral | RRSP]] in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

*   **Immediate Deduction:** Ted's contribution reduces his taxable income, resulting in a tax savings of $4,200 (35% of $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Future Tax Efficiency:** When Robin eventually withdraws the $12,000 from the spousal [[Spousal RRSP rollover and tax deferral | RRSP]] in retirement, she will pay $2,400 in taxes (20% of $12,000) at her lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Net Household Savings:** This results in a net household tax savings of $1,800 ($4,200 immediate savings - $2,400 future tax paid by Robin) by shifting the income to Robin's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Pro Tips for Spousal RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

*   **Avoid Early Withdrawals:** If the receiving spouse (e.g., Robin) withdraws funds within three years of the contributing spouse's (e.g., Ted's) contribution, the withdrawn amount will be attributed back to the contributing spouse and taxed at their higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Plan for Equal Balances:** Aim for balanced [[Spousal RRSP rollover and tax deferral | RRSP]] balances between spouses to prevent uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Consider Age Differences:** If there's a significant age gap between spouses, plan contributions carefully to ensure balanced withdrawals throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

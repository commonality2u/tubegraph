A common [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | myth]] suggests that receiving a salary raise might lead to taking home less money due to being bumped into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For example, if someone's current salary is $56,000 and they are offered a raise to $60,000, they might incorrectly believe they'll end up with less take-home pay if their income crosses a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This misconception arises from a misunderstanding of how tax brackets function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## How Tax Brackets Work in Canada

The [[canadian_tax_system_overview | Canadian tax system]] operates on a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of your income are taxed at different rates, depending on which tax bracket they fall into.

For instance, in the example provided:
*   The [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | current federal tax bracket]] is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   Once income crosses $57,375, the next portion of income is taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Crucially, you are *only* taxed at the higher rate (e.g., 20.5%) on the income you make *above* the threshold ($57,375) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Any income earned below that threshold is still taxed at the lower rate (e.g., 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Example Scenario: Salary Increase

Consider an individual earning $56,000, currently in the 15% [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If they receive a raise to $60,000:
*   The first $57,375 of their income will still be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the portion of their income *above* $57,375 (i.e., $60,000 - $57,375 = $2,625) will be taxed at the higher rate of 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

This demonstrates [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | how tax rates apply to salary raises]] in a progressive system.

## [[Benefits of receiving a raise despite higher tax brackets | Why a Raise is Always Better]]

Given how [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax systems]] work, it is [[benefits_of_receiving_a_raise_despite_higher_tax_brackets | always better to get a raise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A higher salary will always result in more take-home pay, even if a portion of it is taxed at a higher marginal rate.

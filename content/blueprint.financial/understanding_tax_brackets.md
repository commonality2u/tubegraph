It is a common misconception that receiving a raise might lead to taking home less money due to being "bumped into a higher tax bracket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This perspective is incorrect, especially within the [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Myth Debunked

An employee earning $56,000 believed that a raise to $60,000 would result in less take-home pay because their current [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]] was 15%, but crossing $57,375 would move them into a 20.5% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This misunderstanding implies that all income would then be taxed at the higher rate.

## How the Progressive Tax System Works

Canada operates on a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of your income are taxed at different rates according to their respective tax brackets.

For example:
*   Income up to a certain threshold (e.g., $57,375) is taxed at the lower rate (e.g., 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate (e.g., 20.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Therefore, when an individual receives a raise that pushes them into a new [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]], only the portion of income that falls within the new bracket is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The income earned below that threshold remains taxed at the lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Conclusion

It is always financially beneficial to receive a raise because of how the [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] applies [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax brackets]] incrementally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

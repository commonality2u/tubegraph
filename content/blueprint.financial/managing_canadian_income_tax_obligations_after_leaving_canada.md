When leaving Canada, many individuals seek to escape its "brutal Winters" and "high taxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, failing to properly manage tax obligations can result in the CRA pursuing individuals for taxes on their worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. With more Canadians departing, the CRA is closely monitoring tax residency, and a single misstep can lead to significant financial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Common Tax Mistakes When Leaving Canada

Several common errors can lead to unexpected tax liabilities for Canadians moving abroad. Understanding and avoiding these mistakes is crucial for a smooth transition.

### Mistake #1: Not [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status | Understanding Your Tax Residency Status]]

Canada imposes taxes based on residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If tax residency status is not clearly established upon departure, an individual may still be considered a Canadian tax resident and owe taxes on their worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Think of tax residency like an "umbilical cord" that needs to be cut properly to avoid ongoing tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

There are four main types of tax residency status when considering moving countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:

*   **Factual Resident** – Someone who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties to the country, even if temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Emigrant** – An individual who leaves Canada permanently and severs significant residential ties with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The CRA considers an individual an emigrant for tax purposes if they leave Canada and establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident** – An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Non-residents do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but may be taxed on Canadian-sourced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Deemed Non-Resident** – Occurs when an individual qualifies as a tax resident in another country with a tax treaty, meaning Canada will not tax them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The key difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident lies in how tax residency is determined and whether a tax treaty applies, though both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

**Special Warning for Snowbirds:** Spending more than 183 days in the US within a calendar year could lead to classification as a US tax resident and subject an individual to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Tracking days using apps like Day Count or Tax Bird is crucial to avoid exceeding this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Mistake #2: Ignoring Departure Tax (Exit Tax)

Upon leaving Canada, certain assets may be subject to a departure tax, which treats them as if they were sold at fair market value on the day of departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This can trigger capital gains tax even if no actual sale occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

**Assets Subject to Departure Tax:**
*   Stocks and ETFs in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Foreign real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

**Assets Not Subject to Departure Tax:**
*   Canadian real estate owned personally (taxable only when sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
*   Registered accounts like RRSPs and [[changes_to_tfsa_when_leaving_canada | TFSAs]] (though contributions cannot be made after leaving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>

**Example of Departure Tax:**
Alex, a Canadian resident moving to Portugal, owns stocks in a non-registered account and private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Both will be subject to departure tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. His TFSA, RRSP, employer pension plan, and Canadian home are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The CRA deems his stocks and private company shares sold at fair market value, triggering capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. If his total capital gains are $280,000 (e.g., $80,000 from stocks, $200,000 from private company shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, his taxable capital gain (at 50% inclusion) is $140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. At a 27% tax rate, Alex would owe approximately $37,800 in departure tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

**Strategies to Reduce or Defer Departure Taxes:**
*   Consider selling assets before leaving to avoid deemed disposition, which is best if you have a couple of years notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Use capital losses to offset taxable capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Gift or transfer assets to family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   Defer departure tax if you plan to return to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Mistake #3: Filing Form NR73 (Residency Determination Form)

Many assume that filing Form NR73 will help confirm non-resident status with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, this form can work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. When submitted, a CRA official reviews the case and may determine that the individual is still a Canadian tax resident, even if ties are believed to be completely severed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This can lead to continued taxation on worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

**What to do instead:**
*   Skip Form NR73 as it is not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   File a departure tax return, report your departure date, and pay any applicable exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Let your actions prove non-residency by severing significant ties to Canada, such as:
    *   Selling or renting out your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>
    *   Closing Canadian bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>
    *   Cancelling provincial health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
    *   Establishing tax residency in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>

### Mistake #4: Not Checking Tax Treaties and Tiebreaker Rules

When relocating from Canada, it is crucial to understand how tax treaties affect tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Some countries have tax treaties with Canada that include tiebreaker rules to determine residency when both countries can claim an individual as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected and negative tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**How Tax Treaties Determine Residency:**
If the new country has a tax treaty with Canada, the following criteria are typically used to resolve dual residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:

1.  **Permanent Home:** Where do you have a permanent place of residence? If in both countries, the next criterion is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
2.  **Center of Vital Interests:** Where are your personal and economic ties strongest? This includes family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  **Habitual Abode:** In which country do you habitually reside? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
4.  **Physical Presence (183-day Rule):** Some countries automatically consider someone a tax resident if they spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

**Example: Moving to the US**
The US employs a "substantial presence test" to determine tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If you spend 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year, you could be considered a US tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, under the Canada-US tax treaty, tiebreaker rules can resolve dual residency situations even if the substantial presence test is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. If your permanent residence and center of vital interests are still in Canada, you may be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Tiffany, a Canadian citizen, accepts a one-year job in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She owns a condo in Toronto where her family lives and maintains Canadian bank accounts and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. She spends over 183 days in the US, qualifying her as a US tax resident under the substantial presence test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Despite this, the Canada-US tax treaty's tiebreaker rules assess her situation:
*   **Permanent Home:** She owns a home in Canada but rents in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Center of Vital Interests:** Her family and financial ties remain in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Habitual Abode:** She intends to return to Canada, reinforcing Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Citizenship:** If uncertainty remains, her Canadian citizenship favors Canada as her tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
As a result, Canada remains Tiffany's primary tax residency under the treaty, allowing her to avoid being fully taxed as a US resident on worldwide income, for example, on her investments or rental properties in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Mistake #5: Maintaining Significant Ties to Canada

The CRA assesses residential ties to determine if an individual remains a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Failure to properly sever these ties can result in continued taxation on worldwide income after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

**Primary Residential Ties (Strongest Indicators):**
*   **Home in Canada:** Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada:** If they remain in Canada, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada:** Such as children or other dependents living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
Maintaining any of these ties strongly suggests continued Canadian tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

**Secondary Residential Ties (May Influence Status):**
*   **Personal Property:** Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Social Ties:** Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Ties:** Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Canadian Documentation:** Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Mailing Address:** Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can contribute to being classified as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

**How to Sever Residential Ties and Confirm Non-Residency:**
*   Consider selling or renting out your Canadian home, ideally leasing it to unrelated parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   Move your family abroad; bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Close or convert Canadian financial accounts, or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   Update government records: change your address, cancel health coverage, and surrender your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Mistake #6: Not Planning for Tax on Canadian Income After Leaving

Even after departing Canada, certain Canadian-sourced incomes can remain taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Understanding these obligations is crucial to avoid unexpected liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

**Types of Taxable Canadian Income for Non-Residents:**
*   **CPP and OAS:** Generally subject to a 25% withholding tax for non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, tax treaties can reduce this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Rental Income from Canadian Property:** Typically subject to a 25% withholding tax on the *gross* rental amount, not the net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **RSP Withdrawals:** Generally subject to a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

**Strategies to Reduce Withholding Tax:**
*   **File Form NR5:** Non-residents can apply for a lower withholding tax rate on certain income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. If approved, taxes are withheld at a reduced rate based on expected Canadian tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The reduction is valid for 5 years, but a Canadian tax return must be filed annually to maintain the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Elect Under Section 216 for Rental Income:** Non-residents can pay tax on net rental income (gross income minus expenses) instead of the standard 25% withholding on gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This often results in a lower tax liability and allows deductions for property-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. A Section 216 tax return must be filed annually to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

**Tax Treaty Considerations:**
Withholding tax rates vary by country under Canada's tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:12:00]</a>. Before filing NR5 or Section 216, check if your new country has a tax treaty with Canada that automatically lowers your withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. For example, moving to the US will likely result in lower CPP, OAS, and RSP withholding tax rates than the 25% standard rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Mistake #7: Not Establishing Residency in a New Country Properly

Failing to secure legal residency in another country can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Without official tax residency status elsewhere, you may remain liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

**Steps to Properly Establish Residency Elsewhere:**
*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency:** Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Set Up Financial Ties:** Open a bank account, rent or buy a house, obtain an ID card, and register for health insurance in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in Your New Country:** Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

Leaving Canada does not automatically mean leaving taxes behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Without proper planning, individuals could face thousands more in taxes or even double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Tax law becomes exponentially more complex when two tax systems are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

For expert assistance with financial and tax planning for Canadians moving abroad, consider consulting specialists in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

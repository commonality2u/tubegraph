It is a common [[misconceptions_about_tax_brackets | misconception about tax brackets]] that accepting a raise might result in taking home less money due to being "bumped" into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For instance, an individual earning $56,000 might mistakenly think that increasing their salary to $60,000 would lead to less take-home pay because their [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | current federal tax bracket]] of 15% would change to 20.5% once their income crosses $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This understanding of how [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | Canadian federal tax brackets]] work is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Understanding the Progressive Tax System

Canada employs a [[progressive_tax_system | progressive tax system]] for its taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that you are only taxed at the higher rate on the portion of your income that falls above a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Any income earned below that specific threshold continues to be taxed at the lower, previous rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

For example, if the 20.5% tax bracket begins at $57,375:
*   Income *below* $57,375 is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* $57,375 is taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Consequently, it is always financially beneficial to receive a raise, as it will invariably lead to an increase in your net take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea that a raise could result in less money is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

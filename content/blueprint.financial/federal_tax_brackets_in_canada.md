When an individual receives a raise, such as moving from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, it can place them into a higher [[understanding_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]] in Canada, shifting from a 15% to a 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Common Misconception

A frequent error Canadians make is assuming their entire salary will be taxed at the new, higher marginal rate (e.g., 20.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This misunderstanding can lead to the false belief that earning more money actually results in a net loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, this is not how the [[canadian_tax_system_overview | Canadian tax system]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## How Federal Tax Brackets Work

The Canadian tax system uses a progressive structure, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, the first $57,375 of income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Only the income exceeding this threshold is subject to the higher tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider an income increase that pushes an individual's salary to $60,000.
*   The initial $57,375 of income remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the additional $2,625 (the amount above $57,375) is taxed at the higher rate of 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

This means that the average or effective tax rate applied to the total income is significantly lower than the highest marginal rate (e.g., 20.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Impact on Take-Home Pay

Even when entering a higher [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]], individuals will still take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Therefore, misconceptions about tax brackets should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

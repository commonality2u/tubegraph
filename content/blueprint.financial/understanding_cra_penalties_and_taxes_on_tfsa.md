Did you know that your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can be penalized and taxed by the CRA? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> To keep your TFSA truly tax-free, there are three main "red flags" to avoid: turning your TFSA into a business, overcontributing, and holding [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | prohibited investments]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

## Red Flag #1: Turning Your TFSA Into a Business

The CRA can decide that activities within your TFSA constitute a business, rather than simple investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> If this happens, your TFSA stops being tax-free, and all gains are reclassified as taxable business income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>

### Case Study: Fared Ahamed

Fared Ahamed, an investment advisor, opened his TFSA in 2009. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> Instead of buying and holding stocks, he engaged in high-volume trading, primarily with penny stocks, flipping them rapidly, sometimes within hours or days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> He grew his initial contribution into over $600,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

The CRA reviewed his trading patterns and concluded he was running a business within his TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> As a result, his $617,000 was reclassified as taxable business income, leading to significant tax bills and potential penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> Fared appealed, but his case serves as a cautionary tale for those considering day trading within their TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

### Why the CRA Cares About Day Trading

Day trading involves frequent buying and selling to profit from small price changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> The CRA views this as a business activity, not the type of investing a TFSA is intended for. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

The CRA will examine your trading patterns, looking for indicators such as:
*   Flipping stocks like a "pro trader". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Short holding periods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Expert strategies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Use of borrowed funds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

> [!WARNING]
> You'll likely only draw the CRA's attention if you're a successful day trader, as most people are not. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> Once deemed a business, every dollar earned becomes taxable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### How to Stay on the CRA's Good Side

The CRA does not provide explicit rules on what constitutes "too much trading." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> The evaluation is done on a case-by-case basis, emphasizing the need for common sense. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

> [!TIP]
> Keep your TFSA looking like a long-term investing and savings vehicle, not a trading desk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> Stick to investments you plan to hold for a while, such as ETFs, blue-chip stocks, or bonds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> Avoid frequent stock flipping or using leverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

## Red Flag #2: [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | Overcontribution to Your TFSA]]

Contributing more than your allowed TFSA contribution room is a major red flag that incurs penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

### Example: A Massive Overcontribution

In 2020, one taxpayer overcontributed by an astonishing $639,950 to their TFSA, using borrowed funds from a line of credit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> Their plan to invest the excess funds into stocks spectacularly backfired. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>

Under the Income Tax Act, any overcontribution to a TFSA incurs a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> For this individual, it meant a monthly penalty of $6,393 in 2020, plus additional penalties and interest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> The taxpayer claimed ignorance and blamed their financial institution, but the Federal Court ruled against them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> Their delay in withdrawing the funds, hoping for market recovery from 50% losses, violated the rule to fix issues "without delay." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>

### Non-Resident Contributions

[[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_changes_when_leaving_canada | Contributing to your TFSA while no longer a Canadian resident]] is another way overcontributions can occur. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> Even if you're unaware, the CRA will apply the 1% monthly penalty on contributions made while living outside Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> For example, Jessica moved to the U.S. and continued contributing $6,000 to her TFSA, resulting in thousands of dollars in penalties over several years because she didn't catch the mistake while abroad. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

### Common Overcontribution Mistakes to Avoid

*   **Trusting the CRA's online contribution limits:** The CRA's online records may not always be up-to-date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> It's crucial to keep your own meticulous records of contributions to avoid accidental overcontributions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   **Re-contributing in the same year:** Withdrawing from your TFSA does not immediately reset your contribution room. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> The contribution room from withdrawals only resets on January 1 of the following calendar year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> Re-contributing before this date will lead to penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
*   **Not transferring investments in kind:** When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the cash into your TFSA can create overcontribution issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> Instead, transfer the investments "in kind" without selling them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>

> [!NOTE]
> Think of your TFSA as a tightly packed suitcase; adding more than it can hold doesn't just make it burst, it incurs a hefty luggage fee. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>

## Red Flag #3: [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | Prohibited Investments in a TFSA]]

Your TFSA has clear restrictions on what you can invest in. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> The CRA aims to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

Prohibited investments include:
*   **Significant interest holdings:** Owning 10% or more of a private company's shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   **Non-arm's length relationships:** Investments in businesses where you or your family have significant control or influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

### Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The penalties for holding [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_tfsa | prohibited investments]] are severe:
*   **50% Special Tax:** If your TFSA acquires a prohibited investment, you face a tax equal to 50% of the investment's fair market value at the time of acquisition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains:** Any income or capital gains generated from prohibited investments are taxed at 100%, effectively nullifying any benefit from holding them in your TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

> [!WARNING]
> The CRA is serious about these rules, so extreme caution is advised. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

### Common Example: Investing in a Relative's Business

If you invest $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative, and your shares grow to be worth $50,000, the CRA could deem the investment prohibited due to your close connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> The result would be a 50% tax on the $50,000 value ($25,000), and the shares must be removed from your TFSA, meaning future gains are no longer tax-free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>

### How to Stay Safe

Always consult the CRA's guidelines and review their list of qualified investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> Due to the steep penalties, ensure you are only investing in qualified assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

Your TFSA is a powerful wealth-building tool, but only if used wisely and by avoiding these red flags. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone, representing a staggering 37.8% of this age group who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demographic shift significantly alters the approach required for [[retirement planning and financial strategies | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Planning to retire solo demands specific strategies to avoid common financial pitfalls and to maximize every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Median Income for Single Seniors

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older illustrates a significant disparity:
*   For couples, it is $74,200 per year, or approximately $6,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   For single seniors, it is only $30,820 per year, or about $2,568 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
This means single seniors earn less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[Financial risks for single retirees | Biggest Risks for Single Retirees]]

Retiring alone presents unique financial challenges, as there's no partner to share costs, benefits, or provide a financial safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Single individuals often face higher taxes, less government support, and greater pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, with smart planning, a comfortable retirement is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity and Investment Risk)
This is the primary fear in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Unlike couples who share expenses and benefit from tax savings, singles bear all costs alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This significantly increases the risk of running out of money for single retirees due to the absence of a partner's pension or extra savings, and the need for more personal savings to maintain the same lifestyle as a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

To mitigate this risk:
*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: Follow a sustainable withdrawal rate, such as the 4% rule, potentially adjusting it lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Diversify Investments**: A diversified portfolio with a mix of growth assets (stocks) and safety assets (bonds, GICs) helps ensure funds last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Careful Financial Planning**: Work with a financial planner to develop a customized strategy based on lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every decision, from when to take CPP to how much to withdraw, is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden
Being single in retirement often means paying more in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Without access to [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently fall into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income, simply because the couple could split their income and both qualify for full OAS and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

To reduce your tax bill:
*   **Strategic Withdrawals**: How and when money is withdrawn from RRSP, TFSA, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the amount of tax paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Careful timing and drawdown strategies can save thousands in taxes over retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs
Inflation silently erodes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. As a single retiree, there's no one to share the burden of rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Planning for inflation is essential, especially for retirements that can last 30 or more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Creative ways to combat inflation:
*   **Downsizing/Renting Out Space**: Unlock home equity by downsizing or renting out part of your property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Co-living/House Hacking**: Explore co-living with friends or house hacking to cut fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocation**: Consider moving to lower-cost provinces or even countries to stretch every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits
A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the absence of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there's no automatic rollover for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death, potentially leading to a massive tax hit on the estate and less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited support for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

To protect assets:
*   **Careful RRSP/RIF Withdrawals**: Plan gradual withdrawals from RRSPs and RIFs to reduce the final tax burden on your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review**: Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance beneficiary designations are up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support
Loneliness is not only emotionally challenging but also a financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies indicate that single retirees are more susceptible to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

To stay connected and protected:
*   **Join Community Groups**: Engage in volunteering, social clubs, or classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Consider Co-living**: Senior co-housing or shared housing arrangements can cut costs and foster friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Utilize Tech for Safety**: Employ tools like Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Stay Informed**: Scammers frequently target older adults living alone, making financial security awareness even more critical for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### 6. Health and Long-Term Care Costs
Unlike couples, single retirees lack a built-in caregiver, making [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | health care and long-term care planning]] crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Health care costs can accumulate quickly, and single retirees face higher long-term care expenses than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Typical costs in Canada for care include:
*   Home care: $25 to $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Assisted living: $3,000 to $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Government-subsidized nursing home: $2,000 to $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Private care: $5,000+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

To plan for health costs:
*   **Budget for Care**: Establish a reserve fund or investigate long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Assign Power of Attorney**: Designate a trusted individual to make medical and financial decisions if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Consider Disability/Critical Illness Insurance**: These policies can help cover significant medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire - A Single Retiree's Journey

Let's explore a hypothetical scenario to illustrate effective [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | retirement planning strategies]]. Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single retiree, is concerned about having enough savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

**Initial Situation**:
*   **Estimated Spending**: Andy anticipated needing $50,000 per year in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Assets**: $200,000 in RRSP and $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Returns**: Estimated 5% investment return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Income**: No pension, no spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Government Benefits**: Planned to take CPP and OAS immediately at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Goal**: Make money last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Inflation
Andy's initial plan for $50,000 annual spending didn't factor in inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Assuming a 2.1% inflation rate, $50,000 today becomes $55,000 at age 70 and $61,000 at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This oversight caused his money to run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Adjustment 1: Realistic Spending Estimates
Most people overestimate their retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Spending often drops by about 20% upon retirement and further declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
Andy's revised spending estimate:
*   $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
This adjustment alone extended Andy's savings until age 85, significantly improving his [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | financial outlook]] from 54% to 94% goal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Adjustment 2: Delaying CPP and OAS
Initially, Andy planned to take CPP ($10,000/year) and OAS ($8,700/year) at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Delaying these benefits until age 70 substantially increased his annual income from them to $17,000 (CPP) and $13,000 (OAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This single change pushed his shortfall to age 88, making his plan fully funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Adjustment 3: RRSP Meltdown for Tax Smoothing
Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA, which is not taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. To smooth out his taxes, an "RRSP meltdown" strategy was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   Andy began drawing $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This covered expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   His plan reached 102% funding, and his effective tax rate remained low and smooth (3% up to 3% until age 76), eliminating any shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Building a Buffer: [[Strategies for confident spending in retirement | Additional Financial Strategies]]
While 102% funding is good, a larger buffer provides more comfort. Three options were considered to further secure Andy's retirement:
1.  **Work One Extra Year**: By working one additional year, earning $80,000, Andy's plan would be 114% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Monetize a Hobby**: Andy's woodworking hobby could realistically earn him $10,000 a year for six years, bringing his goal progress to 112% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb Condo**: Renting out his condo during the summer for $10,000 a year for six years (while staying with family) would also achieve 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Andy preferred options two and three, allowing him to retire sooner, which is crucial as health can decline with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Retiring as a single person in Canada can be challenging, but it doesn't have to be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. With the right [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | financial strategies]], single retirees can [[strategies_for_managing_retirement_on_limited_income | stretch every dollar]], avoid significant tax burdens, and achieve the retirement they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Detailed financial planning, including stress-testing for market drops, higher inflation, and long-term care costs, provides a clear roadmap and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

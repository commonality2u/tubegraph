The tax deadline in Canada is **April 30th** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Missing out on claiming available tax credits means leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While some credits are automatically applied, most must be manually claimed on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Understanding and utilizing these credits can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Key Canadian Tax Credits

This is a non-refundable tax credit that allows Canadians to earn a portion of their income tax-free before federal income tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the BPA is $15,129 for individuals with net incomes below the 29% tax bracket threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Age Amount Tax Credit

For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, the credit is gradually reduced if net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)

For students aged 16 and above, online courses may qualify if they meet full-time attendance requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Maximizing Savings: Stacking Multiple Credits
The key to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing tax savings]] is not just knowing about individual credits but stacking them together for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Saving Combo
For those in retirement, combining the Pension Income Amount and the Age Amount can significantly lower taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The Pension Income Amount (up to $2,000 per person) combined with the Age Amount (worth up to $9,200 federally in 2025) results in lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. For example, if John has a large pension and Linda has a smaller income, but both are over 65, they can each claim the Pension Income Amount. John also qualifies for the Age Amount Credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Additionally, pension income splitting can further reduce taxes by shifting some of one spouse's income to the other's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This is part of [[retirement_tax_credits_in_canada | Retirement tax credits in Canada]].

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**: Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

For instance, Sarah and Mike, with two young kids, one with a disability, can receive CCB, claim daycare expenses (lowering taxable income), and receive the Canada Caregiver Amount for their child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This combination can result in thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Families can also split income by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Starting your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits early, such as at age 60, can introduce several financial risks that may significantly impact your retirement income and overall financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Tax Implications and OAS Clawback
One of the most significant risks of early CPP withdrawal is [[tax_implications_of_cpp | ignoring the tax implications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. CPP payments are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, which can substantially impact your overall tax situation in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

For example:
*   **Higher Tax Bracket** Taking CPP benefits early can push your total annual income into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For instance, if David, retired at 67 with $90,000 in income, started receiving an additional $10,000 from early CPP, his total income would be $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This extra income could place him in a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Old Age Security (OAS) Clawback** Early CPP payments can also affect other government benefits like Old Age Security (OAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If your total income exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $90,997 for 2024), you may face an OAS clawback, where a portion of your OAS payments are reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This reduction is 15% ($15 for every $100 over the threshold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

Ignoring these tax implications can lead to a lower-than-expected retirement income and reduce the effectiveness of your overall retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Investment Risks vs. Guaranteed Growth
There is a temptation to take CPP benefits early, such as at age 60, and invest the money, hoping to outperform the returns gained by [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While the stock market has historical average annual returns of 7-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, this strategy comes with significant risks:

*   **Market Volatility** Investing early CPP withdrawals exposes your retirement income to market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, the TSX index dropped over 30% and took years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. An early withdrawal invested during such a downturn could severely hit your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Difficulty in Replication** Delaying CPP until age 70 increases your benefits by 42% over what you would receive at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. If you were entitled to $1,000 per month at 65, waiting until 70 would boost it to $1,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:03:00]</a>. This higher payment is also indexed to inflation, preserving your purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. To match this additional $420 monthly benefit with a private indexed annuity, you would need to invest approximately $100,000 upfront between ages 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:21]</a>. Amassing such a sum is difficult for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Taking CPP early and investing is risky and often unreliable, whereas [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_payments | delaying CPP]] offers a predictable, secure, and inflation-adjusted income for life, sparing you from relying solely on market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Impact on Spousal and Survivor Benefits
When planning your CPP strategy, it's crucial to consider how your decisions impact your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Pension Sharing** Pension sharing allows you and your spouse to split CPP income, which can help save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:23]</a>. For example, if one spouse receives $1,200 per month and the other gets nothing, they could split it to report $600 each, leading to tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **CPP Survivor Benefit** The amount a spouse receives from the CPP Survivor Benefit heavily depends on when you start your own CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:55]</a>. Starting CPP at age 60 reduces your monthly benefits by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   If your benefit at 65 would have been $1,000 per month, starting at 60 reduces it to $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   If you pass away, your spouse might receive 60% of that reduced amount (around $384 per month), instead of the $600 they could have received if you had waited until 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:21]</a>.

Ignoring these factors can mean your spouse receives less financial support or you miss out on significant tax savings for your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Over-reliance on CPP
Relying too heavily on CPP as your main source of retirement income is a common mistake that can lead to financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   CPP is designed to replace about one-third (33%) of an average worker's pre-retirement earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   For example, if you earned $40,000 annually before retirement, CPP might provide around $13,200 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   This amount is often insufficient to maintain your standard of living, especially with rising costs for healthcare, housing, and daily expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Over-reliance on CPP can force you to cut back on your lifestyle or deplete other savings more quickly than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:55]</a>.

It is vital to have other sources of income, such as personal savings, investments (like [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | RSPs or TFSAs]]), or other pension plans, to ensure a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:07]</a>. CPP should be viewed as one piece of a comprehensive retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:10]</a>.

High fees are a significant "silent wealth killer" that can quietly drain a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They are considered one of the "sneakiest ways to kill your TFSA potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, causing permanent damage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## High Mutual Fund Fees in Canada

Canada is notable for having some of the [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | highest mutual fund fees in the world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The average Management Expense Ratio (MER) for Canadian Equity Funds is 1.76%, according to a Morningstar report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Major banks, including TD, RBC, and CIBC, commonly offer funds with MERs exceeding 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

A significant issue is that 93.4% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmarks over the last 10 years, which is likely attributable to these high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Closet Indexing

Many high-fee funds engage in "closet indexing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This practice involves charging high fees for "active management" while essentially mimicking the index they are supposed to outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

#### Case Study: RBC US Equity Fund vs. Vanguard VFV

An example illustrating the impact of high fees and closet indexing compares the RBC US Equity Fund with Vanguard's VFV, using the S&P 500 as a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **RBC US Equity Fund:**
    *   Charges a 1.88% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Claims to be actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Its performance closely mirrors the index fund, a classic sign of closet indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Vanguard VFV:**
    *   A low-cost, passive ETF with a 0.09% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   Tracks the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

**Performance Comparison over 5 Years (starting with $100,000):**
*   **Vanguard VFV:** Generated a 116% return, growing the initial $100,000 to $216,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **RBC US Equity Fund:** Had an 88% return, resulting in the $100,000 growing to only $188,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

This represents a substantial difference of $38,000 in just five years, purely due to the impact of fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Over a 20 to 30-year timeframe, these compounded losses from high fees could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

The $4 billion RBC fund, with its nearly 2% MER, collects approximately $80 million annually in fees from Canadian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Thousands of similar high-fee funds in Canada collectively siphon billions of dollars from Canadians' TFSAs each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Canadians generally have mixed feelings about tipping culture, with many questioning its current widespread application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:32">[02:47:32]</a>. While some remain supportive, there is a growing frustration with the expanding expectations around tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:21">[02:54:21]</a>.

## Growing Frustration and Pressure
Recent reports indicate a significant shift in public sentiment:
*   64% of Canadians report being asked to tip more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:59">[03:00:59]</a>.
*   62% feel pressured to leave higher tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:47">[03:04:47]</a>.

This phenomenon, described as "tip creep," is causing fatigue, with 83% of Canadians stating that too many places now ask for tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:36">[03:25:36]</a>. Despite this increase in requests and pressure, only 13% of Canadians feel that service has actually improved as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:36">[03:31:36]</a>. Tipping, which was once a genuine thank you for great service, now often feels like an expected part of the bill, regardless of service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:75">[03:59:75]</a>.

## Shifting Tipping Habits
The standards for tipping have sharply risen, reflecting [[rise_and_impact_of_tip_percentages | tip flation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:33">[03:07:33]</a>:
*   In 2016, 43% of Canadians tipped under 15%, but now only 23% do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:56">[03:10:56]</a>.
*   The number of Canadians tipping 20% or more has more than doubled, from 8% in 2016 to 21% currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.

## Desire for a Service-Included Model
A majority of Canadians, 59%, now prefer a service-included model with higher wages for staff, rather than relying on tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:11">[03:37:11]</a>. This indicates a strong preference for transparency and predictability in pricing.

## Regional Differences
Regionally, British Columbia reports the highest levels of both "tip creep" (74%) and [[rise_and_impact_of_tip_percentages | tip flation]] (73%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:88">[03:44:88]</a>.

## Employer Responsibility
A significant proportion of Canadians (73%) believe that the current tipping system allows employers to underpay their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:77">[03:53:77]</a>.

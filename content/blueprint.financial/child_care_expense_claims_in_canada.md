To claim child care expenses in Canada, the child must be under 16 years old or have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:34">[03:47:34]</a>.

## Eligible Expenses

You can claim expenses for various types of child care services, including:
*   Daycare centers and nurseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>
*   Caregivers such as nannies or babysitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>
*   Boarding schools and overnight camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:27">[04:00:27]</a>
*   Educational institutions, for the portion related to child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:09">[04:04:09]</a>

## Non-Eligible Expenses

Certain expenses cannot be claimed as child care expenses:

*   Tuition for regular schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:08">[04:11:08]</a>
*   Recreational activities like sports or art classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:08">[04:13:08]</a>
*   Transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:04">[04:18:04]</a>

## Claim Limits

The maximum amount you can claim per child varies based on their age and condition:
*   Under 7 years of age: Up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>
*   Between 7 and 16 years of age: Up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:16">[04:28:16]</a>
*   If the child has a disability: Up to $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>

## Example Calculation

Imagine a scenario with two children, aged 4 and 9, in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:05">[04:35:05]</a>:
*   Spent $6,000 on daycare for the 4-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:07">[04:39:07]</a>. (This is under the $8,000 limit for children under 7).
*   Spent $4,000 on after-school care for the 9-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:09">[04:41:09]</a>. (This is under the $5,000 limit for children aged 7-16).

Since both expenses are under their respective maximum allowable deductions, the full amounts can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:04">[04:46:04]</a>. The total deduction for this family would be $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:47">[04:48:47]</a>.

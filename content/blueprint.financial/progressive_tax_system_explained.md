A common misconception regarding salary increases and [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax brackets]] can lead individuals to believe that a raise might result in less take-home pay due to a higher tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, this is not how [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian taxes]] or other [[Progressive tax system explained | progressive tax systems]] work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## The Misconception

Consider an individual currently earning $56,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, with their current federal tax bracket being 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If offered a raise to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, they might mistakenly believe that crossing the income threshold of $57,375 will bump their *entire* income into the next federal tax bracket of 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, leading to the assumption they would take home less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## How a Progressive Tax System Works

A [[Progressive tax system explained | progressive tax system]] ensures that only the income earned *above* a certain threshold is taxed at the higher rate, while income below that threshold remains taxed at its respective lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

For example, if the threshold for a 20.5% tax bracket is $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   Any income up to $57,375 would still be taxed at the previous 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Only the portion of income *above* $57,375 would be taxed at the new 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

This means that an increase in salary, such as from $56,000 to $60,000, will always result in more take-home pay, despite crossing into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea that a raise could make you take home less money is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Therefore, it is always [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | better to get a raise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, demonstrating the positive [[impact_of_salary_raises_on_taxes | impact of salary raises on taxes]] in a progressive system.

A common [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | misconception]] exists regarding how salary raises impact net income, particularly when crossing into a higher [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]]. For instance, an individual earning $56,000 might incorrectly believe that a raise to $60,000 would result in less take-home pay because a portion of their income would then fall into a 20.5% federal tax bracket, up from their current 15% bracket once they cross the $57,375 income threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## How it Works

This belief does not align with how [[canadian_tax_system_overview | Canadian taxes]] operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Canada employs a [[canadian_tax_system_overview | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Under this system:
*   Only the income earned *above* a specific threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For example, income exceeding $57,375 would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   All income earned *below* that threshold continues to be taxed at the previous, lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, such as 15% in the example given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding the [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | progressive nature of tax brackets]] clarifies that it is always [[benefits_of_receiving_a_raise_despite_higher_tax_brackets | beneficial]] to [[benefits_of_income_growth_despite_tax_increases | receive a raise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The notion that a raise might lead to less take-home pay due to a higher [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] is a [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | classic myth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) limit will increase to $1.25 million in 2025, up from approximately $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This exemption allows individuals to shield a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business Corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## How the LCGE Works
For example, if an individual sells a qualified small business for $1.25 million in 2025, they could potentially exempt the entire capital gain from their individual tax, depending on their remaining LCGE limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> The LCGE is available to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. If multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their portion of the gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This strategy can significantly reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Comparison with the Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI)
While the [[Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive]] (CEI) reduces the [[capital_gains_tax_update_for_corporations_in_2025 | capital gains inclusion rate]], it does not address investment income taxation, which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. For many business owners, the LCGE remains a more effective tool because it offers a complete exemption for eligible [[managing_capital_gains_and_losses | capital gains]], especially when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Strategically allocating gains across shareholders can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

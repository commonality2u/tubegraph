For 2025, the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) limit has seen a notable increase, providing greater tax relief for business owners in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This change allows individuals to shield a larger portion of capital gains from taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Key Updates

*   **New Limit** The LCGE limit for 2025 has increased to $1.25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Previous Limit** This is an increase from approximately $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## How it Works

The LCGE allows individuals to exempt a portion of their [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. For instance, if a qualified small business is sold for $1.25 million in 2025, the entire [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] could potentially be exempt from individual tax, depending on the seller's remaining LCGE limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Strategic Planning

A key aspect of the LCGE is that it is available to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This means that if multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their respective portion of the gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This strategy can significantly reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

For many business owners, the LCGE remains a more effective tool compared to the Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI), as it offers a complete exemption for eligible [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. By strategically allocating gains across shareholders, the benefits of the LCGE can be maximized, further reducing tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

Unknowingly sabotaging your TFSA can cost thousands of dollars, but most mistakes are easy to fix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines common errors related to [[overcontribution_penalties_for_tfsas | overcontribution penalties for TFSAs]] and technical pitfalls to avoid.

## [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | CRA Penalties on TFSA Investments]]: Overcontribution Mistakes

[[overcontribution_penalties_for_tfsas | Overcontributing to your TFSA]] can quickly lead to significant penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Any amount exceeding your TFSA limit is subject to a 1% monthly penalty on the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Rectifying this often involves withdrawing the overcontribution and potentially negotiating with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Common Overcontribution Gotchas

There are three common pitfalls that lead to accidental [[overcontribution_penalties_for_tfsas | overcontribution penalties for TFSAs]]:

1.  **Trusting the CRA's Contribution Limits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
    *   The CRA's website may not always reflect recent transactions, which can lead to accidental overcontributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to keep your own records, such as a spreadsheet or note on your phone, to track your exact remaining contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
    *   *Example:* An individual logged into the CRA website, saw $5,000 of room, but it didn't account for a recent $5,000 deposit, resulting in an [[overcontribution_penalties_for_tfsas | overcontribution penalty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Recontributing in the Same Year** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>
    *   If you withdraw money from your TFSA and recontribute it in the same calendar year, your contribution room does not reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   The contribution room from a withdrawal is only restored in the *next* calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   To avoid [[overcontribution_penalties_for_tfsas | penalties]], it is best to wait until the following year to recontribute funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
3.  **Not Transferring Investments "In Kind"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>
    *   When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the cash into your TFSA can lead to [[overcontribution_penalties_for_tfsas | overcontribution issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   To avoid this, you can transfer investments "in kind" without selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Even with "in kind" transfers, caution about timing is needed to prevent unintentionally reducing contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Understanding the Technical Side of the TFSA

Many people miss out on the full potential of their TFSA by not fully understanding its technical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Key Technical Points to Keep in Mind

1.  **Knowing Permitted Investments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>
    *   Not all investments are permitted within a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   Private or foreign assets, for example, might be prohibited, and investing in them could lead to [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
    *   The CRA provides a list of permitted investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. A little research can help avoid costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
2.  **Gains and Losses Don't Impact Contribution Room** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
    *   A common misconception is that investment gains or losses within your TFSA affect your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   In reality, your contribution room is solely based on your deposits and withdrawals, not the performance of your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   Whether your investments skyrocket or dip, your TFSA limits remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
3.  **Not Limited by Your Bank** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>
    *   Many people mistakenly believe they must stick with their bank's investment options for their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   Banks often steer clients towards high-cost mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   Platforms like Questrade, Wealthsimple, or EQ Bank often offer more options and lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Shopping around can improve returns and broaden investment choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

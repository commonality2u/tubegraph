Many Canadians have built seven-figure [[principles_for_building_a_sevenfigure_rrsp | RRSPs]] not by being the highest earners or stock-picking geniuses, but by following a set of key principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One of these "secrets" is adopting a stoic approach to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Stoic Investing
Stoicism is an ancient school of thought that teaches one to control what is within their power and ignore what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Applying this mindset to investing can be life-changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Many investors are ruled by emotion, becoming excited when stocks rise and panicking when they fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. They constantly second-guess themselves, reacting impulsively to headlines and market updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In contrast, [[principles_for_building_a_sevenfigure_rrsp | RRSP millionaires]] take a stoic approach, following a rules-based system and adhering to it consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## What Stoic Investors Do Differently

### Ignore Market Noise
The media frequently presents financial doom and hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, stoic investors do not react to these short-term market moves, understanding they are irrelevant to their long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Instead of making impulsive decisions, they remain focused on their plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Don't Let Fear or Greed Control Them
Average investors often become greedy when stocks are high, chasing hot stocks and making risky bets, then panic selling when the market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. [[principles_for_building_a_sevenfigure_rrsp | RRSP millionaires]] avoid getting caught up in hype and do not panic during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. They trust their strategy, knowing that sticking to a plan outperforms emotional decisions over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Accept Volatility as Part of the Game
Markets naturally fluctuate, but many people panic when their portfolio drops, assuming they are losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Stoic investors, however, view downturns as buying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. They continue investing, confident that markets will recover and grow over decades, not just hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Why This Approach Works
Consider two investors:

*   **Josh, the Emotional Investor:** Josh checks his portfolio multiple times a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. He panics and sells when markets fall, and rushes to buy into hot stocks when they rise, constantly second-guessing his decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This often leads him to sell low and buy high, negatively impacting his returns due to emotional decisions and added trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

*   **Ashley, the Stoic Investor:** Ashley invests consistently and remains calm regarding day-to-day market news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. She does not react to short-term movements and continues to contribute to her [[effective_rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP]] regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. After 30 years, Ashley is significantly wealthier, not because of brilliant stock picks, but because she remained calm and adhered to her plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

This disciplined approach, focusing on long-term strategy over short-term emotional reactions, is a cornerstone for building substantial wealth within an RRSP.

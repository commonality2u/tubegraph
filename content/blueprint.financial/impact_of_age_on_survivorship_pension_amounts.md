The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) provides a survivorship pension that may continue to be paid to a deceased contributor's spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The amount a survivor receives is significantly influenced by their age at the time of their spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Eligibility for the CPP Survivorship Pension

To qualify for the CPP survivorship pension, two main requirements must be met:
1.  **Relationship Status**: The applicant must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.
2.  **CPP Contributions**: The deceased must have contributed to the CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for at least 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

[!TIP] Apply as soon as possible for the survivorship pension. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, so delays can result in a loss of entitled funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

> For example, if Emma is eligible for $700 a month and waits 18 months to apply after John's death, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

## [[how_survivorship_pensions_are_calculated | How Survivorship Pensions Are Calculated]]

The amount of the CPP survivorship pension received depends on two key factors: the survivor's age at the time of their spouse's death and the amount the deceased spouse contributed to the CPP over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

> The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of their actual age at passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This means the calculation is based on what the deceased would have received at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

### Survivor Under 65

If the survivor is under 65 years old when their spouse passes away, they receive a flat rate amount plus 37.5% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

> As of 2024, the flat rate is $227 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
> For example, if John's calculated CPP retirement pension at age 65 would have been $1,200 per month, Emma (under 65) would receive $450 (37.5% of $1,200) plus the $227 flat rate, totaling $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Survivor 65 or Older

If the survivor is 65 years or older, their survivorship pension is recalculated, and they receive up to 60% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This age group does not receive the flat rate portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

> For example, if John's calculated CPP retirement pension at age 65 would have been $1,200 per month, Emma (65 or older) would receive $720 per month (60% of $1,200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### Actual Average and Maximum Payments (2024 Data)

*   **Under 65**: The average payment is $524 a month, with a maximum of $739 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.
*   **65 or Older**: The average payment is $323 per month, with a maximum of $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

The difference between average and maximum payments suggests that many survivors do not receive the full potential amount, often due to the deceased spouse's contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The maximum payout is only achievable if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## Maximum Survivor Pension Cap

There is a cap on the total CPP benefits a survivor can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. The combined amount of the survivor's own CPP benefits and the survivorship pension cannot exceed the maximum CPP retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

> ### Example Scenarios
> *   **Retirement Pension + Survivorship Pension**: If Emma receives $800/month from her own CPP retirement pension and qualifies for $700/month from John's survivorship pension (combined total $1,500), her benefits will be reduced to the retirement cap of $1,375 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
> *   **Lower Retirement Pension**: If Emma's CPP retirement pension is $400/month and she qualifies for $600/month from John's survivorship pension (combined total $1,000), she would receive the full $1,000 as it is below the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
> *   **Disability Pension + Survivorship Pension**: If Emma receives $1,200/month from CPP disability benefits and qualifies for $500/month from John's survivorship pension (combined total $1,700), her total benefits would be adjusted to the combined survivor and disability pension cap of $1,613 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

### Advanced Planning Strategies around the CPP Cap

*   **Start CPP Early if Below the Cap**: If your CPP retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting CPP early might be a good option. This allows collection of both your CPP and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   **Delay CPP if Near the Cap**: If your expected CPP is close to the maximum, delaying your CPP can maximize your overall benefit. This way, you receive a higher survivorship pension without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## Duration of the Survivorship Pension

The CPP survivorship pension is received for life, with no time limits, as long as the survivor is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Remarriage**: Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility; payments will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **Death of the Survivor**: Payments will cease upon the survivor's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

## [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_application | How to Apply for the Survivorship Pension]]

Applying is straightforward. Complete the application on the Government of Canada's website and provide documents like the deceased spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Remember to apply as soon as possible due to the 12-month retroactive payment window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

## Other Related Benefits

### CPP Children's Benefit
Children of the deceased may be eligible for the CPP Children's Benefit, which provides financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. This benefit is a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child (2024), not based on earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

Eligibility requires the child to be:
*   Under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>
*   Between 18 and 25 and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>

The benefit stops once the child turns 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. Applications are made through Service Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.

### CPP Death Benefit
This is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased, though it can be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. It helps cover immediate expenses like funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits

All CPP benefits mentioned, including the survivorship pension, child benefit, and death benefit, are taxable and must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

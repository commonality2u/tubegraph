All-in-one ETFs, also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by bundling multiple ETFs into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They aim to provide instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets without the hassle of picking individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Key Advantages

*   **Simplicity and Low Maintenance**
    All-in-one ETFs simplify investing by eliminating the need for constant rebalancing, second-guessing, or endless research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. They offer a "set it and forget it" approach to managing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Instant Diversification**
    These ETFs provide immediate diversification across various asset classes, countries, and industries, which helps to reduce risk and potentially enhance returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For example, Vanguard VGRO, a popular all-in-one ETF in Canada, offers exposure to over 13,000 companies worldwide through a mix of Canadian, US, International, and emerging market stocks (80%) and a blend of Canadian and global bonds (20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Alternative**
    One of the significant advantages of all-in-one ETFs is their low fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They typically charge a Management Expense Ratio (MER) between 0.2% to 0.25%, which is substantially lower than traditional mutual funds in Canada that often charge around 2% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. VGRO, for instance, has an MER of 0.24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Automatic Rebalancing**
    All-in-one ETFs automatically manage their asset mix, buying and selling within themselves to maintain the desired stock-to-bond ratio. This eliminates the need for investors to manually adjust their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Suitable for Smaller Accounts**
    For those starting with a smaller account, such as a [[Features and benefits of Canadas TFSA | TFSA]] or RRSP, a single all-in-one ETF provides instant diversification without requiring investments across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Time-Saving**
    Instead of researching and purchasing dozens of individual stocks and bonds, investors gain a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of investments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Standalone Investment**
    All-in-one ETFs are designed to be complete, standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Adding more funds can disrupt their carefully designed balance and asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For example, VGRO alone provides sufficient diversification with 13,000 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Who Benefits from All-in-One ETFs?

*   **Beginners**
    Ideal for those new to investing who want a simple, low-maintenance portfolio without the complexities of picking stocks or rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Busy Professionals**
    Suitable for individuals with demanding careers or businesses who lack the time to actively manage investments, allowing their money to grow in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Parents Investing for Children's Future**
    For long-term savings accounts like RPs, these ETFs provide instant diversification and minimal maintenance for a child's education fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors**
    Those starting with smaller accounts can achieve broad diversification from day one with a single all-in-one ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

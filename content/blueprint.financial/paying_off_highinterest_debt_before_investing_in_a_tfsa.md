A common mistake is to begin investing in a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) before addressing high-interest debt, such as credit card balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While investing may seem like a proactive financial move, high-interest debt can significantly undermine wealth-building efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## The Cost of High-Interest Debt

Credit card interest rates can often be 20% or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. It is exceedingly difficult for investments, even [[investment_options_for_growing_a_tfsa | high-performing investments]], to consistently generate returns that match or exceed such high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For context, even legendary investors like Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, have delivered an average annual return of approximately 20% since 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The Advantage of Debt Repayment

By focusing on paying off high-interest debt, you are effectively "earning" a return equivalent to the interest rate you avoid, which could be 20% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This strategy offers multiple benefits:
*   **Significant Savings** This approach saves a substantial amount on interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Stronger Financial Position** Clearing high-interest debt places you in a much more stable financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Freedom to Invest** Once the burden of high-interest payments is removed, you gain greater freedom to invest more effectively without the drag of accruing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Recommendation

It is advisable to assess your debt situation and consider redirecting funds towards paying off high-interest liabilities first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Once you are debt-free, you will be better positioned to invest in your TFSA and watch your savings grow without the financial strain of interest draining your hard-earned money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

A common misconception among Canadians is the belief that a salary increase, which bumps them into a new [[household_tax_changes_and_federal_income_tax_bracket_adjustments | federal tax bracket]], means their entire income will be taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, if someone receives a raise from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, they might perceive their entire salary as now being taxed at 20.5% instead of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This can lead to the incorrect feeling that they are losing money by [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | earning more]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, this is not how the Canadian [[progressive_tax_system_explained | tax system]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Understanding Marginal Tax Rates

The Canadian tax system uses a progressive structure, meaning different portions of your income are taxed at different rates. When your salary increases and pushes you into a [[understanding_tax_brackets | higher bracket]], only the *additional* income above the previous threshold is taxed at the new, higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For instance, if the first $57,375 of income is taxed at 15%, and income above that is taxed at 20.5%:
*   The initial $57,375 of your income continues to be taxed at the 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Only the amount exceeding this threshold—in the example of a $60,000 salary, this would be the extra $2,625 ($60,000 - $57,375)—is taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Effective Tax Rate

Because only a portion of your income is taxed at the higher marginal rate, your overall tax burden, known as your average or effective tax rate, is significantly lower than the highest marginal rate you reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite entering a higher tax bracket, you will always take home more money when your income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | More income]] is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Therefore, misconceptions about tax brackets should not deter you from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

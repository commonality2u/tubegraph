Many Canadians envision a retirement filled with sunshine and beach walks abroad, funded by their Canadian government benefits like CPP, OAS, and GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, the reality of what happens to these benefits and their [[managing_canadian_income_tax_obligations_after_leaving_canada | tax implications]] when you become a non-resident can be surprising and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Most Canadians are unaware of the specific rules regarding their government income when they [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | move abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

This article details which benefits continue, which stop, and how they are taxed for Canadians retiring overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): Not Portable

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit designed to support low-income seniors living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is explicitly not portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Key Rules and Implications
*   **Cessation**: If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Income and Tax Filing**: This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **No Social Security Agreements**: There are no social security agreements that protect your GIS payments; they are strictly tied to your physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Gan's Experience
> Gan, a 71-year-old retiree receiving both CPP and GIS in Vancouver, moved to Mexico. A few months into her move, her GIS was terminated because she was outside Canada for more than six months, automatically disqualifying her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Planning Tip
If GIS is a critical part of your [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | retirement income]], consider delaying your move, adjusting your budget, or exploring other income options to replace the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

> [!idea] Pro Tip: Residency Trick
> Some retirees maintain part-year residency in Canada to keep their healthcare and tax status, known as the "snowbird" move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They spend winters abroad but ensure they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP): Portable but Taxable

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits are based on your contributions during your working life in Canada, not on your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means your CPP benefits will travel with you, and the amount received remains the same regardless of your country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Portability and Taxation]]
*   **Portability**: Your CPP payments continue even if you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Withholding Tax**: CPP payments may be subject to withholding tax if you are considered a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Tax Treaties**: If Canada has a tax treaty with your destination country, this tax could be reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **No Treaty**: Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Moving to the US, a tax treaty is in place, and you may avoid withholding tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Social Security Agreements**: Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries that help avoid double contributions, ensure CPP coverage continues uninterrupted, and coordinate benefits if you worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Other Benefits**: CPP survivor benefits and child benefits also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Linda's Retirement
> Linda worked in Toronto for 35 years, contributing to CPP the entire time. Now planning to retire in Spain, her CPP payments will not change because they are based on her contributions, not her residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Receiving Payments
You can have CPP payments direct deposited into a Canadian bank account, or in many countries, receive them in local currency through a local bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Checks in Canadian dollars can also be mailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Local Tax Laws
While your CPP amount doesn't change, your new country of residence might tax these payments differently. It is important to check local tax laws to avoid being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS): Residency-Based

Old Age Security (OAS) benefits are based on residency, not work history or contributions like CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Qualification and Suspension
*   **20-Year Rule**: You can receive OAS abroad if you have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If you meet this, your monthly OAS payment will continue, even if living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Suspension**: If you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure, your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and reestablish residency to receive it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Exceptions (Social Security Agreements)**: You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country with a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time lived in both countries totals at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Years lived in another country only help determine if you qualify; they do not increase your OAS amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Pedro's OAS
> Pedro moved to Canada at age 25 and lived there for 30 years before retiring to Spain. Because he met the 20-year residency requirement, he continues to receive his full OAS payments while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### [[tax_implications_for_single_canadian_retirees | Tax Implications]]
*   **Taxable Income**: Your OAS payments are considered taxable income, even when living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident Withholding Tax**: OAS may be subject to a non-resident withholding tax, with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   **Tax Treaties**: A tax treaty with Canada may reduce or eliminate this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   **Example: US**: If you move to the US, Canada's tax treaty means your OAS is not subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Example: Germany**: If you move to Germany, the tax treaty allows Canada to tax public pensions like OAS at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Tax Slips and Filing**: While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. You must include this when filing your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Continued Filing**: You must continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

> [!idea] OAS Pro Tip: Recovery Tax (Clawback)
> If you are concerned about hitting the income threshold for the OAS recovery tax (clawback), which begins at $93,454 in 2025, consider [[tax_saving_tips_for_canadian_retirees | managing your taxable income]] through RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. These are common [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | retirement tax strategies]].

## Planning Strategies to Maximize Benefits

Effective [[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | planning]] is crucial for Canadian retirees moving abroad.

> [!example] Example: Anita's Retirement Plan
> Anita, 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years of living and working in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. She qualified for CPP, OAS (having crossed the 20-year residency threshold), and GIS due to her modest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Portugal has a social security and tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
>
> *   **CPP**: Continues without interruption. Due to the tax treaty, she pays a reduced 15% withholding tax on her CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
> *   **OAS**: Continues because she met the 20-year residency requirement. Had she moved a year earlier, she would have received nothing until returning to Canada or qualifying through the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
> *   **GIS**: Stops after six months, regardless of income level, as it requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
>
> **Anita's Success**: She delayed her move until she hit 20 years of residency and chose a treaty country like Portugal to reduce tax. She also planned early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Cheat Sheet: Your Retirement Benefits Abroad

Here’s a simple guide to how your CPP, OAS, and GIS behave when you leave Canada to help you remember the [[rules_and_considerations_for_retaining_canadian_benefits_while_living_abroad | rules and considerations]]:

| Benefit | Behavior When Retiring Abroad | Key Considerations |
| :------ | :---------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **CPP** | **Goes everywhere with you.** (Ride-or-die friend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> | Subject to withholding tax (up to 25%) unless reduced/eliminated by a tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Based on contributions, not residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. |
| **OAS** | **More selective.** (Loyalty card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> | Requires 20+ years of Canadian residency (after age 18) to continue abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Can be suspended if you leave for >6 months and don't meet the 20-year rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Subject to withholding tax (default 25%) unless reduced/eliminated by a tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. |
| **GIS** | **Stops after 6 months.** (Loves Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> | Not portable and strictly tied to physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. No social security agreement or workaround can protect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. |

> [!tip] Additional Pro Tips
> *   **RRSP Withdrawals**: Consider drawing down your RRSPs before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
> *   **Private Healthcare**: Plan for private healthcare, as provincial coverage ends after 6 to 7 months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Retiring abroad involves more than just sunshine and lower rent; the [[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | financial rules change rapidly]], and the consequences can be very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

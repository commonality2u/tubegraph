When [[understanding_tax_residency_status_when_leaving_canada | leaving Canada]], individuals may be subject to a departure tax, also known as exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This tax treats certain assets as if they were sold at their fair market value on the day an individual departs, potentially triggering capital gains tax even if no actual sale has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Assets Subject to Departure Tax

The following types of assets are generally subject to departure tax:
*   Stocks, ETFs, and other investments held in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Foreign real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Assets Not Subject to Departure Tax

Certain assets are exempt from departure tax:
*   Canadian real estate owned personally, which is only taxable when sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Registered accounts such as RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, contributions to these accounts are not permitted after leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Example of Departure Tax Calculation

Consider Alex, a Canadian resident moving permanently to Portugal and severing his tax ties with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. His assets include:
*   Stocks in a non-registered account.
*   Private company shares.
*   A TFSA, RRSP, employer pension plan, and a Canadian home.

When Alex leaves, the CRA considers his stocks and private company shares as sold at fair market value, triggering capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. His TFSA, RRSP, employer pension plan, and Canadian home are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The total capital gains are $80,000 from stocks and $200,000 from private company shares, amounting to $280,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
His taxable capital gain, with a 50% inclusion rate, is $140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
At a 27% tax rate, Alex owes approximately $37,800 in departure tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce or Defer Departure Tax

Individuals can employ several strategies to minimize or postpone departure tax obligations:
*   **Sell assets before leaving** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>: This avoids the deemed disposition and is most effective if one plans their departure a few years in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Utilize capital losses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>: Capital losses can be used to offset taxable capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Gift or transfer assets to family members** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Defer departure tax** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>: This option is available if one plans to return to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Navigating the complexities of exit tax often requires professional guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

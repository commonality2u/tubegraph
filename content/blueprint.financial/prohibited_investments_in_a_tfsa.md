Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is not a free-for-all when it comes to investments; it has clear restrictions on what you can invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. Failure to adhere to these rules can result in significant [[CRA penalties on TFSA investments | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## What Constitutes a Prohibited Investment?

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) aims to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>, ensuring TFSAs remain tools for legitimate, arms-length investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Specifically, the following are generally prohibited:

*   **Significant Interest Holdings** Owning 10% or more of a private company's shares is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Arms Length Relationships** Investments in businesses where you or your family have significant control or influence are also banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

## Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The [[CRA penalties on TFSA investments | penalties]] for holding [[nonqualified_tfsa_investments | prohibited investments]] in your TFSA are severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>:

*   **50% Special Tax** If your TFSA acquires a [[nonqualified_tfsa_investments | prohibited investment]], you will face a tax equal to 50% of the fair market value of the investment at the time it was acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains** Any income or capital gains earned from [[nonqualified_tfsa_investments | prohibited investments]] are taxed at 100%, effectively erasing any benefit from holding these investments in your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

The CRA takes these rules very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Common Example

Consider an example where you invest $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. If the business grows and your shares are valued at $50,000, the CRA could deem the investment [[nonqualified_tfsa_investments | prohibited]] due to your close connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. The result would be a 50% tax on the $50,000 value, amounting to a $25,000 [[CRA penalties on TFSA investments | penalty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. Additionally, the shares must be removed from your TFSA, meaning any future gains will no longer be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

## How to Stay Safe

To avoid these steep [[CRA penalties on TFSA investments | penalties]], always ensure you are investing only in assets that qualify as [[investment_options_for_a_tfsa | TFSA investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. It is crucial to consult the CRA's guidelines and review their list of qualified [[investment_options_for_a_tfsa | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

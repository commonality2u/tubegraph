All-in-one Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by combining multiple ETFs into a single fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. They offer instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets, eliminating the need to select individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## How All-in-One ETFs Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

All-in-one ETFs can be thought of as a "financial smoothie" that provides a perfectly blended mix of investments, ready to support financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. They provide exposure to thousands of investments worldwide, offering a professionally managed portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### What All-in-One ETFs Invest In <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>

Using Vanguard VGRO as an example, this ETF has over $6 billion in assets under management and is a trusted all-in-one ETF in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It provides broad exposure to global stocks and bonds, creating an instantly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Stocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
    *   Typically have an 80% asset allocation within VGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Include a mix of Canadian, US, International, and Emerging Market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Offer access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   Top 10 holdings can include major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, RBC, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Bonds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    *   Typically have a 20% allocation within VGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Comprise a blend of Canadian and global bonds, which helps stabilize a portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Diversification** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   Instead of relying on a single market or sector, all-in-one ETFs like VGRO spread investments across different countries, industries, and asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This approach reduces risk and can enhance returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   The management expense ratio (MER) for VGRO is low, at 0.24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Performance Example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

An investment of $10,000 into VGRO from January 2020 to 2025 would be worth approximately $16,000, demonstrating the power of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[benefits_of_using_allinone_etfs | Benefits of All-in-One ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

Investors favour all-in-one ETFs for several key advantages:

*   **Low-Cost Alternative to Mutual Funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>: All-in-one ETFs typically have a low fee structure, usually between 0.2% to 0.25% MER, which is significantly lower than traditional mutual funds in Canada that often charge around 2% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Automatic Rebalancing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>: These ETFs automatically buy and sell within themselves to maintain the intended stock-to-bond ratio, eliminating the need for manual adjustments to your asset mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Smaller Accounts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>: For those starting with a TFSA, RRSP, or other investment account, a single all-in-one ETF provides instant diversification without requiring investments across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Diversification and Time-Saving** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>: Rather than researching and buying numerous stocks and bonds, investors get a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of global investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This "set it and forget it" approach aligns with the philosophy that investing should be "boring" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Who Should Use All-in-One ETFs? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

*   **Parents Investing for Kids' Future** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>: Great for long-term savings accounts like an RESP for a child's education, providing instant diversification and low maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>: Perfect for starting with smaller accounts (e.g., TFSA, RRSP) to achieve immediate diversification with a single ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## [[how_to_choose_the_right_allinone_etf | How to Choose the Right All-in-One ETF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>

The key to choosing the right all-in-one ETF is selecting the appropriate asset allocation that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

*   **Canadian ETF Providers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>: Major providers in Canada offer high-quality all-in-one ETFs, including iShares (BlackRock), Vanguard, BMO, and Horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   iShares: Known for XGRO, XBAL, XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   Vanguard: Offers VGRO, VBAL, VQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   BMO: Provides ZGRO, ZBAL, ZQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Horizons: Offers unique swap-based ETFs for tax efficiency in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Matching Risk Tolerance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
    *   **Higher Risk/Higher Returns**: Look for 100% stocks and 0% bonds (e.g., VQT, XEQT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   **Balanced Growth**: Consider 80% stocks and 20% bonds (e.g., VGRO, XGRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Lower Risk/Steady Growth**: Opt for 60% stocks and 40% bonds (e.g., VBAL, XBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   **Conservative/Stability**: Choose 40% stocks and 60% bonds (e.g., VCNS, XCNS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Your risk tolerance and investment goals should drive your decision, rather than focusing solely on the ETF provider, as long as fees are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## [[steps_to_invest_in_allinone_etfs | Steps to Invest in All-in-One ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

Generally, the process involves:

1.  **Determine Risk Tolerance**: Use tools like the Vanguard investor questionnaire to assess your comfort with market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
2.  **Choose a Brokerage**: Select a brokerage account such as Wealthsimple Trade or Questrade for zero commission fees, or larger bank platforms like TD Direct Investing or RBC Direct Investing for convenience (though they may have higher fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Ensure you open the correct account type (TFSA, RRSP, non-registered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
3.  **Buy the ETF**: Log into your brokerage, search for the ETF ticker (e.g., VGRO or ZBAL), enter the number of shares, choose a market or limit order, and confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
4.  **Set Up DRIP (Optional)**: Enable dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) to automatically reinvest dividends to buy more shares, compounding growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Is One Fund Enough? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>

Yes, all-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Adding more funds can disrupt their carefully designed balance and specific risk levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. If you want to experiment beyond a single all-in-one ETF, consider using separate accounts for different strategies (e.g., TFSA for all-in-one ETF, RRSP for a stock portfolio, non-registered for tax-efficient ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_with_allinone_etfs | Common Mistakes to Avoid with All-in-One ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>

Even with their simplicity, investors can make mistakes:

*   **Dishonest Investor Questionnaire Answers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>: Not answering honestly can lead to choosing the wrong ETF for your actual comfort level. Being too conservative might limit growth, while being too aggressive could lead to panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Tweaking Too Much** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>: The "set it and forget it" approach is a key advantage. Constantly checking accounts or making unnecessary changes, especially due to market swings, can negatively impact long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Patience is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>: Some investors mistakenly combine multiple all-in-one ETFs or add other ETFs for "extra diversification." This messes up the built-in balance and adds unnecessary complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. An ETF like VGRO, with exposure to 13,000 companies, offers sufficient diversification on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

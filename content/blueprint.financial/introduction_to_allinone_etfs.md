All-in-one ETFs, also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by bundling multiple ETFs into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This provides instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets without the hassle of picking individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. They aim to allow investors to set up their investments once and avoid constant rebalancing, second-guessing, or endless research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How All-in-One ETFs Work: Vanguard VGRO Example

Vanguard VGRO is a prominent example of an all-in-one ETF in Canada, managing over $6 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It provides exposure to a broad range of global stocks and bonds, offering investors an instantly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The asset allocation for VGRO is typically:
*   **Stocks**: 80% allocation, mixing Canadian, US, International, and emerging market stocks, providing access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Bonds**: 20% allocation, consisting of a blend of Canadian and global bonds, which helps stabilize the portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

This diversification means investments are spread across different countries, industries, and asset classes, reducing risk and potentially enhancing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. All-in-one ETFs like VGRO typically have a low management expense ratio (MER), with VGRO's being 0.24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Top holdings in VGRO include major companies from both US and Canadian markets such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, RBC, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. An all-in-one ETF can be thought of as a "financial smoothie," providing a perfectly blended mix of investments without the need for individual selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

For example, a $10,000 investment in VGRO from January 2020 to January 2025 would have grown to approximately $16,000, demonstrating the power of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[benefits_of_allinone_etfs | Benefits of All-in-One ETFs]]

Investors favor all-in-one ETFs for several key reasons:

*   **Low-Cost Alternative to Mutual Funds**: All-in-one ETFs typically charge an MER between 0.2% and 0.25%, which is significantly lower than the 2% MER often seen with traditional Canadian mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Automatic Rebalancing**: These ETFs automatically buy and sell assets internally to maintain the desired stock-to-bond ratio, eliminating the need for investors to manually adjust their asset mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Smaller Accounts**: For those starting with investment accounts like TFSAs or RRSPs, a single all-in-one ETF provides instant diversification without requiring investments spread across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Diversification and Time Savings**: Instead of researching and purchasing numerous stocks and bonds, investors gain access to a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of global investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This "boring" approach to investing aligns with economist Paul Samuelson's view that investing should be more like "watching paint dry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Who Should Use All-in-One ETFs?

All-in-one ETFs are suitable for various investor profiles:

*   **Beginners**: They offer a simple, low-maintenance portfolio for new investors who prefer not to worry about stock picking or rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Busy Professionals**: Individuals with demanding careers or businesses can utilize all-in-one ETFs to keep their money growing in the background without needing constant adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Parents Investing for Children's Future**: For RESPs or other long-term savings accounts for children's education, an all-in-one ETF provides instant diversification and requires minimal maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors**: Starting with a smaller TFSA or RRSP account, a single all-in-one ETF is perfect for immediate diversification, offering exposure to thousands of stocks and bonds without multiple purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## [[how_to_choose_the_right_allinone_etf | How to Choose the Right All-in-One ETF]]

When selecting an all-in-one ETF, the most crucial factor is choosing the right asset allocation based on your risk tolerance and investment goals, rather than focusing on the specific company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Canadian ETF Providers

Several major providers offer high-quality all-in-one ETFs in Canada:
*   **iShares (BlackRock)**: Known for XGRO, XBAL, and XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Vanguard**: Offers VGRO, VBAL, and VEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **BMO**: Provides ZGRO, ZBAL, and ZEQT, offering strong diversification and a big bank brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Horizons**: Features unique swap-based ETFs designed for tax efficiency, particularly for non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

These providers generally offer low-cost, diversified, and auto-rebalancing ETFs that simplify investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Matching Risk Tolerance to Asset Allocation

The key decision is how much risk you are comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>:
*   **Higher Risk/Higher Returns**: ETFs with 100% stocks and 0% bonds, such as VEQT and XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Balanced Approach with Growth**: ETFs with 80% stocks and 20% bonds, like VGRO and XGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Lower Risk/Steady Growth**: ETFs with 60% stocks and 40% bonds, such as VBAL and XBAL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Conservative/Stability Focus**: ETFs with 40% stocks and 60% bonds, like VCNS or XCNS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Your risk tolerance and investment goals should primarily drive your decision, assuming the ETF provider offers competitive fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## How to Invest in All-in-One ETFs Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Determine Your Risk Tolerance
Before purchasing, assess your comfort level with risk to choose between aggressive (e.g., VEQT) or balanced (e.g., VBAL) ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Free tools like the Vanguard investor questionnaire can help by asking questions about market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Step 2: Choose a Brokerage
You will need a brokerage account to buy your ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Popular Canadian options include:
*   **Wealthsimple Trade**: Offers zero commission fees and is beginner-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Questrade**: Also offers zero commission fees on ETF purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Big Bank Platforms (e.g., TD Direct Investing, RBC Direct Investing)**: Convenient for those who prefer banking with these institutions, but typically charge higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Ensure you open the correct account type (TFSA, RRSP, or non-registered) based on your investing goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Step 3: Buy the ETF
Once your account is set up, you can buy your all-in-one ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The general process involves:
1.  Logging into your brokerage account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
2.  Searching for the ETF by its ticker (e.g., VGRO, ZBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
3.  Entering the number of shares you wish to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
4.  Choosing a market order (for immediate purchase) or a limit order (to set a specific price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
5.  Confirming the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

You should receive a notification once the purchase is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Optional Step: Set up a DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan)
A DRIP automatically reinvests any dividends paid by your ETF into buying more shares, rather than letting the cash sit idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Most brokerages allow you to enable this feature in settings or by contacting customer support, helping to compound growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For further convenience, consider setting up automatic monthly contributions from your paycheck into your all-in-one ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### One Fund Enough?
Yes, all-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments per account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Adding more funds can disrupt the carefully designed balance for a specific risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Mixing and matching might throw off your asset allocation and inadvertently change your intended risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

If you wish to experiment beyond a single all-in-one ETF, consider using separate accounts for different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>:
*   **TFSA**: Keep it simple with an all-in-one ETF like VGRO for long-term tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **RRSP**: Build your own stock portfolio while keeping a portion passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account**: Focus on [[Covered call strategy in ETFs | tax-efficient ETFs]] like Horizons' swap-based ETFs to minimize taxes on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## [[common_investment_mistakes_with_etfs | Common All-in-One ETF Mistakes to Avoid]]

Even with their simplicity, investors can make mistakes that harm returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>:
*   **Dishonest Investor Questionnaire Answers**: Failing to answer risk tolerance questions honestly can lead to selecting an unsuitable ETF. An overly conservative choice may limit growth, while an overly aggressive one could cause panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Frequent Tweaking/Getting Bored**: The "set it and forget it" approach is a major advantage. Constantly checking accounts, making unnecessary changes, or selling due to market swings can hurt long-term returns; patience is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Buying Too Many ETFs in One Account**: Some investors buy multiple all-in-one ETFs or combine them with other ETFs, believing it adds extra diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This only complicates matters and messes up the built-in balance. For instance, VGRO already includes 13,000 companies, providing ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Stick with one ETF that matches your risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

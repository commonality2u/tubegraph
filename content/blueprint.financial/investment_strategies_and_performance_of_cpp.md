The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) has consistently outperformed expectations, demonstrating robust investment strategies and strong financial performance. While 64% of Canadians may worry about the CPP's future due to an aging population and rising costs, the fund is more secure than commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Outperformance of Expectations

The CPP's financial health is strong, largely due to its investment performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion, achieving an 8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This pushed the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This figure significantly surpasses earlier projections. In 2000, the CPP was expected to reach $425 billion by 2023; however, it actually reached $632 billion in 2023, exceeding projections by more than $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This outperformance reflects sound long-term investment decisions by fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even through challenging economic periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This growth ensures the CPP can handle the increasing number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Sustainability and Projected Growth

The [[cpps_financial_stability_and_growth_projections | CPP's financial stability and growth projections]] indicate long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Every three years, the Chief Actuary of Canada assesses the CPP's financial health, with the latest report confirming its stability for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The fund's projected growth is substantial:
*   By 2030, assets are expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   By 2040, assets are projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   By 2050, the fund is expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

These forecasts highlight the CPP's potential to support both current retirees and future generations of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The fund is expected to remain financially stable into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting

The accuracy and reliability of CPP reports are ensured through multiple layers of independent oversight:
*   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** Provides impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health, operating independently of political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 31st Actuarial report (2022) confirmed the CPP's 75-year sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** Reviews the Chief Actuary's reports, adding another layer of independent, non-partisan scrutiny to ensure financial data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** Independent firms, such as Deloitte, conduct external audits. Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, reinforcing trust in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

These safeguards make the CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available, providing peace of mind to Canadians about their retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Investment Performance and Management Details

The performance and management of CPP Investments are crucial to its long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Strong Long-Term Returns
CPP Investments has delivered strong long-term returns:
*   **10-year net nominal return:** 9.2% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>
*   **5-year net nominal return:** 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>

This consistent performance has driven the fund's assets to $632 billion, significantly exceeding projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Diversified Global Portfolio
The fund's strategy includes a globally diversified portfolio across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Investments span various asset classes:
*   Public and private equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   Infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   Fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the remainder spread across international markets. This diversification helps reduce "home bias risk" by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy, enhancing the fund's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Active Management Strategy
CPP Investments employs an active management approach, investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term, although it may underperform in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. For example, while the CPP's 8% net return for fiscal 2024 was strong, it fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Despite short-term fluctuations, active management is essential for a pension fund like the CPP to address the complexities of pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The significant growth of CPP assets, far exceeding projections, indicates sound investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

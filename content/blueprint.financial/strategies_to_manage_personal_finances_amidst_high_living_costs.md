Canada is currently experiencing a significant cost of living crisis, with approximately 50% of Canadians living paycheck to paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This has led to widespread financial struggles, with social media reflecting the distress of many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A recent Angus Reid poll indicates that 40% of recent immigrants are contemplating moving to another province or leaving Canada entirely due to the high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Rising Cost of Living in Canada

Several factors contribute to the financial challenges faced by Canadians:

### Escalating Everyday Expenses
The price of essential goods has seen dramatic increases. David Olive's article in the Toronto Star highlights that a basket of 18 household items, which cost $82 in March 2021, now costs $113.32 as of July 2024â€”a 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The latest Canada Food Price Report forecasts an additional $701 increase in the average family of four's annual [[strategies_to_budget_and_save_on_groceries_in_canada | food bill]] this year, bringing the total to $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This follows a $1,065 jump in 2023, showing that food prices have consistently outpaced the average rate of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Soaring Rental and Housing Costs
Shelter costs are another major concern. The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver increased from $2,598 per month in April 2021 to $3,648 per month in July 2024, a 40% rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Home ownership has become increasingly difficult; the average cost to buy a house in Canada skyrocketed by 69.3% in nine years, from $413,000 in 2015 to $699,000 by May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Stagnant Incomes
Unfortunately, [[strategies_to_increase_personal_income | income growth]] has not kept pace with the rising cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals was $70,500, a decrease from $73,000 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Average wages have likely not increased significantly in 2023 or 2024 to counteract inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Discontinuation of Pandemic Benefits
The end of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs have further strained household finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Impact on Canadians

The high cost of living has led to widespread unhappiness, particularly among Canadian youth. The latest World Happiness Report ranks Canada 15th overall, but for Canadians under 30, the ranking plummets to 58th, highlighting a significant disparity in happiness levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

A significant portion of Canadians are considering relocating internally; 28% are thinking of leaving their province due to high housing costs, with young adults and renters being the most prone to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This trend is particularly notable in Ontario and BC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Popular relocation spots include Alberta, known for more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Between 2022 and 2023, over 130,000 people migrated out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

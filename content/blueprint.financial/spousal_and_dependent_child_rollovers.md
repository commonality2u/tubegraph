Upon death, an individual's entire RRSP balance is typically added to their income for that year and taxed at the highest marginal tax rate, potentially leading to over half the balance disappearing to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, an RRSP balance of $700,000 could result in $371,000 in taxes in Ontario, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

To mitigate this significant tax hit, several strategies can be employed, including rollovers to a spouse or dependent child.

## Spousal Rollover

This strategy involves transferring an RRSP balance to a surviving spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### How it Works
Upon the death of an RRSP holder, their entire RRSP balance can be rolled over tax-free to their spouse's or common-law partner's RRSP or RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This defers immediate taxation, allowing the surviving spouse to pay taxes only when they begin withdrawing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Michael and Emily
> Michael passes away with a $700,000 RRSP balance. Instead of this amount being taxed at 53%, it is transferred tax-free to his wife Emily's RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Emily will not owe taxes until she starts making withdrawals from the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Pros
*   Immediate tax deferral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Provides the surviving spouse with control over when to withdraw funds, potentially leading to future tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Cons
*   Only applicable if there is a surviving spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Taxes are deferred, not eliminated; they will still be due when the spouse begins withdrawals and upon their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   This is considered a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## RRSP Rollovers for Dependent Children

In specific situations, an RRSP can be transferred tax-free to a dependent child or grandchild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### How it Works
An RRSP can be transferred tax-free to a dependent child or grandchild, typically if they are financially dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> [!example] Example: David and Lily
> David passes away with a $500,000 RRSP. His 17-year-old granddaughter, Lily, qualifies as a dependent due to her disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The RRSP is transferred to her tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Without this rollover, the $500,000 would be taxed at 53%, leaving only $235,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. With the rollover, Lily will not owe taxes until she begins making withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Pros
*   Avoids immediate taxes if the dependent child qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Provides financial support for children or grandchildren in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Cons
*   Strict rules apply: the child must be dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   Not available for most adult children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Related Strategies

While direct rollovers are specific, other [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement income splitting strategies]] also involve spouses for tax efficiency.

### RRSP Income Splitting
This strategy involves the higher-earning spouse contributing to a [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]] in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The lower-income spouse can then gradually withdraw these funds in retirement, reducing the overall RRSP balance and minimizing the tax hit when the RRSP holder passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This falls under broader [[income_splitting_strategies_for_couples | income splitting strategies for couples]] and can be part of [[examples_of_family_and_retirement_tax_stacking_strategies | family and retirement tax stacking strategies]].

> [!example] Example: Mark and Susan
> Mark is in a 45% tax bracket, while his wife Susan will be in a 20% tax bracket when she retires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Mark contributes $20,000 annually into Susan's [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]] and receives a tax deduction at his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In retirement, Susan withdraws $40,000 per year from her [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]], taxed at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This reduces Mark's overall RRSP balance by the time he passes away, leading to a much smaller tax bill on death than if he had retained all funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

This strategy helps save taxes during retirement and reduces the final tax bill upon death by gradually drawing down the RRSP at a lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] is a valuable strategy for reducing taxable income and avoiding the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback, particularly when one spouse has a significantly lower income than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## How it Works
This strategy allows you to transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This helps the higher-income spouse keep their taxable income below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Benefits
By utilizing [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]], couples can:
*   **Reduce Overall Taxable Income** By shifting income to a lower tax bracket, the couple pays less tax overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Avoid OAS Clawback** Lowering the higher-income spouse's taxable income can help them stay below the OAS clawback threshold ($9,997), preserving their full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Lower Tax Burden** This method reduces the couple's combined tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Example
Consider Peter Parker, who earns $60,000 annually from his pension, while his wife, Mary Jane, has a much lower income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   Peter can transfer $30,000 (50%) of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000, placing him in a lower tax bracket and decreasing his risk of triggering the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Mary Jane, being in a lower tax bracket, is taxed on the $30,000 she receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   The overall effect is a reduction in the couple's total tax payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Crucially, by lowering Peter's taxable income, they can keep his total income below the OAS clawback threshold of $9,997, ensuring he retains his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

This strategy is particularly effective for couples where one spouse's income significantly exceeds the other's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. It not only reduces their overall tax burden but also helps protect the higher-income spouse's OAS payments from being reduced by the clawback, making it a highly valuable tool for retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

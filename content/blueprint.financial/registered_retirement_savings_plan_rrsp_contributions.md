## Contribution Deadlines
The general deadline for Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) contributions for the 2024 tax year is March 3, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Special Considerations for Age 71
If you turn 71 in 2024, December 31st is your final opportunity to contribute to your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. After this date, your RRSP must be converted into a [[estate_planning_involving_rrifs | RRIF]] (Registered Retirement Income Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Missing this deadline means losing the chance to contribute to your RRSP forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Special Considerations for Spousal RRSPs
While the general contribution deadline for spousal RRSPs for the 2024 tax year is March 3, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, there is an exception: if your spouse turns 71 this year, the contribution deadline is December 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Attribution Rules
Be aware of attribution rules with spousal RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. If funds are withdrawn from a spousal RRSP within three years of being contributed, the income will be attributed back to the original contributor for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Converting a First Home Savings Account (FHSA) to an RRSP
If a First Home Savings Account (FHSA) remains unused, it can eventually be converted into an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This conversion can provide additional RRSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## General Advice
It is generally advisable to avoid early withdrawals from your RRSP unless absolutely necessary, as significant penalties may apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

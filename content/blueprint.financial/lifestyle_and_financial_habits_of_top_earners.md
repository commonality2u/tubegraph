This article explores the income thresholds, lifestyles, and financial habits of Canada's top income earners, including the top 10%, 5%, and 1% of individual income earners, based on 2022 data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Top 10% Earners in Canada

To join the top 10% of individual income earners in Canada, an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Median Income**: $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Average Income**: $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

[[income_thresholds_for_top_earners_in_canada | Income thresholds for top earners in Canada]] for the top 10% have shown several key trends between 2018 and 2022:
*   **Rising Entry Bar**: The threshold increased by 14.3%, from $97,000 to $111,000, reflecting higher overall income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average Gap**: By 2022, the average income was over $50,000 higher than the median, indicating that a small number of ultra-high earners significantly influence the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Resilience**: Top earners experienced substantial income growth despite major economic events like the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting this segment is relatively insulated from broader economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Growing Inequality**: Both median and average incomes for the top 10% rose faster than national income averages, contributing to widening income inequality in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Lifestyle of the Top 10%
Life in the top 10% is characterized by stability, flexibility, and "quiet wins," rather than constant luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Example (David)**: A 37-year-old engineer earning $120,000 annually. He lives comfortably with his family in a three-bedroom home, drives practical vehicles, and is intentional with finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Financial Habits**: David automates contributions to his RSPs and can afford one nice vacation per year, dinners out, and extracurricular activities for his kids without significant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They maintain peace of mind through preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Wealth Tracking**: A key habit for the top 10% is tracking their wealth, often using tools like a net worth tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This aligns with [[the_importance_of_net_worth_over_income | the importance of net worth over income]].

### Lifestyle of the Top 5%
Being in the top 5% offers peace of mind and freedom that many Canadians strive for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Example (Rachel)**: A 45-year-old senior policy analyst earning $160,000 annually. She and her partner own a detached home in Ottawa, manage expenses with dual incomes, and enjoy vehicle flexibility (SUV and leased electric car) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

*   **Staying at the Top**: Roughly 69% of top 1% earners in 2022 were also in this group the previous year, and 96% had been in the top 5% at least once in the prior five years, indicating that membership in this group is generally stable once achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Lifestyle of the Top 1%
Life in the top 1% offers the ability to work, invest, and build something lasting, but it also comes with high demands and complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Example (Mark)**: A 48-year-old marketing agency owner earning over $350,000 annually. He owns a detached home in a sought-after Toronto neighborhood and a lakeside cottage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

*   **Advanced Financial Habits**: While he maxes out RRSPs and TFSAs, most of his wealth is held in a holding company, invested in real estate, stocks, and private deals, managed by an advisory team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. These are common [[strategies_for_wealthy_canadians | strategies for wealthy Canadians]].
*   **Philanthropy**: Mark also engages in charitable giving, supporting youth mental health causes and establishing a donor-advised fund to involve his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Comparison to Average Canadians

There is a stark contrast between the incomes of top earners and average Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   The median income for most Canadians ranges from $35,000 to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   The highest median income, for the 45-54 age group ($51,500), is still significantly below the top 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The top 5% threshold ($147,100) is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25-34 year old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This starkly contrasts with the [[global_wealth_perspective_and_financial_mindset | global wealth perspective and financial mindset]].

## Beyond Income: The Importance of Net Worth

Regardless of income level, building freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth depends on what one does with their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Example (Ronald Reed)**: A janitor from Vermont who accumulated an $8 million fortune through simple, consistent investing, despite not earning a high salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

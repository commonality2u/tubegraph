While financial calculations are crucial, non-financial factors can often outweigh purely monetary estimations when deciding whether to lease or buy a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. This is especially true because financial projections like resale value and investment returns are just estimates and the car market is unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. For instance, if you had leased a vehicle in 2017, you would have missed out on profiting from the soaring used car prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, as owning would have allowed you to capitalize on that market shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

Here are some non-financial considerations to seriously evaluate:

## Ownership Preference
*   **Buy:** Opt to buy if you prefer [[pros_and_cons_of_leasing_vs_buying_vs_financing_a_car | long-term ownership]] and the ability to customize your vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
*   **Lease:** Consider leasing if you enjoy driving new models every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>.

## Tax Write-Offs
*   **Lease:** Leasing offers deductible payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
*   **Buy:** Buying allows for [[vehicle_expenses_and_depreciation_for_business_purposes | depreciation]] and interest deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.
*   **Decision:** Choose based on your business's financial strategy if you are a business owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

## Debt Aversion
*   **Lease:** Leasing typically means lower monthly payments without incurring long-term debt, and it may feel less burdensome if you prefer to avoid debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. However, this often comes with generally higher overall payments compared to buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.
*   **Buy:** Buying results in equity in the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

## Flexibility
*   **Buy:** Buying offers the freedom to sell your car at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
*   **Lease:** Leasing locks you into a specific term, but it may include conveniences like warranty coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Plans
*   **Buy:** Purchase your car if you intend to keep it for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
*   **Lease:** Lease if you prefer making frequent changes to your vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.

## Environmental or Emotional Factors
*   **Buy:** Buying may support sustainability more and allow for greater attachment to the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.
*   **Lease:** Leasing provides access to the latest eco-friendly models due to higher turnover, though it might not feel as personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

## Maintenance
*   **Buy:** If you buy, you are responsible for maintenance costs post-warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **Lease:** Leasing often includes maintenance during the lease term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

## Insurance Costs
*   **Lease:** Leased vehicles can potentially require higher insurance, which might increase overall costs compared to buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

## End of Lease Options
*   **Lease:** Leasing offers the option to buy the car at the end of the term, providing flexibility if you are unsure about committing to a purchase upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

## Buying Used Cars
Buying used cars is often considered the smartest financial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. By purchasing cars that are typically three to five years old, you avoid the initial depreciation hit and get more value for your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Cars in this "sweet spot" are usually not old enough to have major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Additionally, [[benefits_of_buying_used_cars | used cars]] typically have lower insurance costs and less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. With research, you can find a reliable, well-priced used car that meets your needs, often with comparable or better features than a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

[[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | Private equity]] refers to investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments often involve funding startups, financing turnarounds, or supporting business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Potential Benefits of Private Equity

Unlike traditional stocks, [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit their capital for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For those who are patient and strategic, it can be a powerful wealth-building tool beyond what an RSP provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Drawbacks of Private Equity

Like any high-reward investment, [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] comes with notable drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### High Fees
[[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | Private equity]] investments come with significant costs, including management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Understanding these expenses is crucial as they can dramatically reduce profits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### High Risk and Limited Liquidity
[[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | Private equity]] investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. There is also always a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For instance, many Canadian investors suffered losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture under [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] real estate investing, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Long Lockup Periods
Investors must be prepared to commit their funds for extended periods, often between 5 to 10 years, before seeing any returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, an investment of $100,000 into [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] might yield $300,000 five years later when the company goes public, but during those five years, the funds would be inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Private Equity and RRSPs

RSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments, meaning they typically do not allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Therefore, unless investing through a specialized structure, [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] investments need to be held outside an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### When Private Equity Can Be Held in an RSP
Despite these restrictions, certain self-directed RSPs provide access to [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts allow investors to hold CRA-approved [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] funds, enabling tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Examples include the North Leaf Capital Partners [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | Private Equity]] Fund, a Canadian fund available to some RSP accounts, and select [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] investments offered through Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, many [[Private Equity Strategies for Wealthy Canadians | private equity]] investments will not be available through an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

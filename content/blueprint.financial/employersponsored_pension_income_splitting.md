[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] is a strategy that allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse, aiming to reduce the household tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This section specifically addresses employer-sponsored pension income, not [[cpp_income_splitting | CPP income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Eligibility Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
Eligibility for [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]] depends on the type of pension income and whether the individual is under or over the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. There are two main types of employer-sponsored pension income: Defined Benefit Pension Plans (DBPP) and Defined Contribution Pension Plans (DCPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Before Age 65
*   **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP)**: Income from a DBPP qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] prior to age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP)**: Withdrawals from a DCPP generally do not qualify for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] before age 65, unless specific circumstances like the spouse's passing away apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### After Age 65
*   Both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution income become eligible for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Withdrawals from Registered Income Funds (RIFs) and Life Income Funds (LIFs) also become eligible, simplifying the balancing of taxable income for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Example: Ted and Robin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
Consider Ted and Robin, both retired and in their 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   Ted receives $40,000 annually from his pension, taxed at his marginal rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Robin has minimal income, placing her in a lower tax bracket of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

By using [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]], Ted can shift some of his pension income to Robin, resulting in lower overall taxes for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Effectiveness of Splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>
*   **Without splitting**: Ted would pay $12,000 in taxes (30% of $40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **With splitting**: By splitting 20% of the income (e.g., $8,000), Robin is taxed at her lower 15% rate, rather than Ted's 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This shift can lead to household tax savings, such as $3,000 in the example, by moving income to the lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

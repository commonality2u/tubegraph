While the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) has long been the traditional choice for retirement savings, the new First Home Savings Account (FHSA) offers a flexible and powerful alternative, even for those not initially planning to buy a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## FHSA for Retirement Savings

The FHSA can function as a bridge to your RRSP, offering the same growth potential with added flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

*   **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to $8,000 per year to an FHSA, with a lifetime maximum of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. These contributions are tax deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an upfront tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Potential**: Both the FHSA and RRSP offer excellent [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | investment potential]], allowing for a wide range of options like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. The key benefit is tax-deferred growth, meaning you won't pay taxes on gains as your investments compound over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Flexibility and Transfer**: If you contribute to an FHSA but decide not to buy a home within the 15-year period, the balance can be transferred into your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This ensures you won't lose any tax advantages or contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. This flexibility means you can take advantage of tax-free withdrawals for a house, and if plans change, simply transfer funds to your RRSP without penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Benefits**: The FHSA provides upfront tax savings, and if eventually used for a home, tax-free withdrawals, and no repayment obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. When transferred to an RRSP, the funds continue to grow tax-deferred within the RRSP framework.

## RRSP for Retirement Savings

The RRSP is a powerful tool for retirement, especially in specific scenarios.

*   **Contribution Limits**: The RRSP allows for higher annual contributions, up to 18% of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Potential**: Similar to the FHSA, the RRSP offers tax-deferred growth on a wide range of investment options, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Matching**: A significant advantage of the RRSP is employer matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. If your employer offers to match your RRSP contributions, this is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. The FHSA currently does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **US Dividend Stocks**: For investors holding US stocks, the RRSP is the smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Any dividends earned on US stocks in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which is avoided when investing through an RRSP due to the US-Canada tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Invest in US stocks through your RRSP, not your FHSA, to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the RRSP is a traditional choice for retirement and excels with employer matching and US dividend stock investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, the FHSA often comes out ahead in most other categories, including flexibility and tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. The FHSA's ability to seamlessly transfer into an RRSP makes it an ideal starting point for both first-time home buyers and long-term retirement planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

For Canadians facing high home prices, combining the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) can help achieve a significant tax-free down payment, potentially reaching $200,000 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy helps maximize savings and make homeownership a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA, also known as the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | First Home Savings Account]], is a new tool specifically designed for [[fhsa_considerations_for_firsttime_homebuyers | first-time homebuyers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Key Features and [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | Contributions]]
*   **Annual Limit:** You can contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Lifetime Limit:** There is a lifetime maximum contribution of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Tax Deductibility:** Contributions are [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax deductible]], similar to an RSP, offering a tax break each year you contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** A key [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | benefit of the FHSA]] is that qualifying withdrawals for a home purchase are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This means every dollar saved goes directly towards your home without repayment obligations, unlike the RSP's Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Doubling Savings with a Partner
If you are buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, you can combine both FHSAs to reach a total of $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

> [!TIP] [[Using FHSA for income splitting | Income Splitting]] for FHSA
> If someone else, like a spouse, with higher income contributes to your FHSA, the contribution is treated as if you made it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The tax benefits, such as deductions and tax-free growth, apply to you (the FHSA holder), and the contributor has no tax obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### [[Investment potential in FHSA and RRSP | Investment Potential]]
The FHSA can grow significantly over time. If you contribute the maximum of $8,000 per year for 5 years, you'll reach $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Assuming a 6% annual return, this could grow to approximately $45,000 in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. If left for an additional 10 years at the same rate, it could grow to around $80,000, doubling the original contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This growth remains completely tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

The RSP is a long-time favorite for [[retirement_savings_considerations_with_fhsa_and_rrsp | retirement savings]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Annual Contribution Limit:** You can contribute up to 18% of your income annually, with a maximum of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Home Buyers' Plan (HBP):** The HBP allows you to withdraw up to $60,000 from your RSP tax-free for a first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Spousal HBP:** If buying with a spouse, this doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Repayment Obligation:** Unlike the FHSA, HBP withdrawals must be repaid over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Missing a repayment adds the amount to your taxable income, increasing your tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Combined Strategy for Maximized Down Payment

By strategically combining the FHSA and RSP (via the HBP), first-time homebuyers can significantly increase their down payment.

### Case Study: Ross and Rachel
Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home, demonstrate the power of this combined strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **FHSA Contribution:** They each max out their FHSA, contributing $40,000 each, totaling $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **RSP HBP Withdrawal:** They also tap into their RSPs through the HBP, withdrawing $60,000 each for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Total Down Payment:** By combining their FHSA and HBP withdrawals, Ross and Rachel secure $200,000 for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This allows them to enter the housing market sooner with less financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Even an individual can use this strategy to save up to $100,000 towards a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Long-Term [[Investment potential in FHSA and RRSP | Growth Potential]] for Couples
Consider Ross and Rachel again:
*   They contribute the maximum $8,000 per year to their FHSAs for 5 years, reaching $80,000 combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   With a 6% return over the next 10 years, their combined FHSA balance could grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Adding $120,000 from their combined RSP HBP withdrawals, they would have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Canadian Housing Market Reality

The Canadian housing market presents a significant challenge for many first-time homebuyers, with skyrocketing prices, particularly in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Even in more affordable areas, rapid price increases demand larger down payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Down Payment Impact by Region
A $200,000 down payment's impact varies greatly by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>:
*   **Montreal and Calgary:** In these more affordable cities, $200,000 can cover about 32% of the total home cost, providing a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Toronto and Vancouver:** In higher-priced markets, the same $200,000 covers only about 16% to 19% of the cost, requiring buyers to take on much larger mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

This highlights the crucial role of [[comparison_of_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | tax-free savings tools]] like the FHSA and HBP, especially for buyers in expensive cities, to offset larger mortgage burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## The Power of Tax Advantages

The [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax advantages]] of accounts like the FHSA and RSP make a massive difference in how much you actually need to save for a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Consider saving $200,000 without these tax-free accounts:
*   If you have a 30% tax rate, you would need to earn over $285,000 just to have $200,000 left after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This means you'd need to earn an extra $85,000 to reach your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

By contrast, using the FHSA and RSP:
*   Your contributions are tax deductible, meaning you don't pay taxes on that income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   This allows you to save the full $200,000 without paying a penny in taxes on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Every dollar contributed goes directly towards your home purchase, drastically cutting down the overall amount you need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Combining the tax-free benefits of the FHSA down payment and the RSP's Home Buyers' Plan creates a clear, faster path to owning your dream home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This smart financial planning can turn what once seemed impossible into a real opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

The majority of Canadians receive significantly less than the maximum possible Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average Canadian getting 40% less than the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article explores [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | strategies]] to help you get closer to the maximum CPP amount.

## Understanding CPP Payout Differences
Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, even at the same retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For 2024, if you start your pension at the standard age of 65, the maximum monthly amount is $1,364.60, while the average amount paid for a new retirement pension at age 65 (as of April 2024) was only $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This means the average is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Payouts also vary significantly based on when you start receiving them:
*   **Age 60:** Average $522, Maximum $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   **Age 65:** Average $816.52, Maximum $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   **Age 70:** Average $1,159, Maximum $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

### [[Factors affecting CPP payouts | Factors Determining Your CPP Payouts]]
The key [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | factors determining]] your CPP retirement pension benefits include:
*   **Contributions:** The amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   To receive the maximum benefit, you typically need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Average Earnings:** Your average earnings over your career directly relate to your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Higher average earnings lead to higher CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   Gaps or years with lower/no earnings can reduce your average earnings and thus your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## [[CPP payment strategies and optimization | Strategies to Maximize Your CPP Payments]]
Here are ways to potentially go from average or below-average CPP payments to the maximum:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working while receiving CPP, you can still contribute to the plan up to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These additional contributions earn you a Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB), which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### 2. Drop Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings from your benefit calculation, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation:
*   **General Drop-Out Provision:** You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals approximately 8 years if you've contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Drop-Out:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years from your CPP calculation, which can increase your benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions:** If you experienced periods of disability, these can adjust your lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### 3. Max Out Your Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career
Ensure your annual income meets or exceeds the YMPE, which is $68,500 for 2024 and increases annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher paying positions throughout your career. The more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP, and the higher your future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Contributions:** Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings will result in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Estimating Your CPP Benefits
To know if you're on track to maximize your CPP, you can estimate your future benefits:

### 1. Rule of Thumb (Ballpark Estimate)
CPP has been enhanced to replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. While this is a very general guide, it can give you a ballpark idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### 2. Online Calculators
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** Comprehensive and detailed, but can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier-to-use option, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### 3. Statement of Contributions
This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Online:** Access via your My Service Canada Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. You can sign in through your bank if you have an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Once signed in, select "CPP/OAS" and scroll to the contribution section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **By Phone:** Call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Considerations

### Delaying CPP Start Age
While [[financial_incentives_for_delaying_cpp | delaying your CPP]] start age significantly increases your payout, it's crucial to understand that it doesn't boost you from an average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The other [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | strategies]] mentioned above are what help you reach the maximum amount based on your contributions.

Many people believe that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. For most individuals, it is generally better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] Maximizing CPP vs. Delaying CPP
> Reaching the *maximum* CPP benefit depends on your contribution history and earnings. [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | Delaying CPP]] (e.g., from 60 to 70) increases your *overall* monthly benefit amount, but this increase applies whether you were on track for an average or maximum payout. It doesn't magically turn an average contribution history into a maximum one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

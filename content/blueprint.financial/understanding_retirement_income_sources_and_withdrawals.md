As you approach retirement, a crucial step is to understand and plan for your income sources and withdrawal strategies. This ensures a steady income stream to maintain your desired lifestyle and provides [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | financial security]] throughout your retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Current Income Levels

Understanding your current income is a foundation for planning. For example, Pam and Jim Helper, through careful financial planning, were projected to have strong income levels leading up to retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. In 2024, their combined total employment income was $160,000, with additional income sources bringing their total to $190,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This robust income allowed them to save comfortably and prepare for their long-term financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Tracking all your assets, liabilities, and income sources provides a clear snapshot of your financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Strategic Withdrawals from Savings

Planning how and when to withdraw from your retirement accounts is vital for maximizing your savings and ensuring a consistent income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Jim and Pam planned to make strategic withdrawals from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. For instance, when Jim turned 65 in 2042, they planned to start withdrawing from their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, and at age 71, they would begin withdrawing from their RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This gradual approach helped them ensure a steady income stream for years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Government Benefits: CPP and OAS

Government benefits like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) are significant components of the [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | Canadian retirement income system]]. Jim and Pam planned to start receiving both CPP and OAS benefits at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, expecting almost $30,000 combined from these sources in 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

While starting at 65 is a common strategy, individuals have flexibility:
*   **Delaying Benefits**: You can delay both CPP and OAS until age 70 for larger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Earlier Benefits**: Alternatively, you can start taking CPP as early as age 60, though this comes with a reduction of up to 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Deciding when to take CPP and OAS is key to maximizing [[strategies_for_extending_retirement_income | retirement income]] and should align with your broader financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

A [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | scarcity mindset]] is a financial philosophy common among many Chinese people, particularly immigrants, that emphasizes saving due to the belief that there is never enough money, opportunities, or security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This mindset is rooted in experiences of growing up with limited resources and witnessing financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Origins and Characteristics
The [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | scarcity mindset]] often stems from a constant worry about making ends meet, where every dollar counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. In the very recent past, China was a very poor country, which contributed to this mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Growing up in such an environment makes individuals hyper-aware of spending, always hunting for deals, and planning for worst-case scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

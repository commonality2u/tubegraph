When assessing personal financial standing, it can be beneficial to take a global perspective, as it helps reframe challenges and can motivate smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Global Income and Purchasing Power

A global wealth calculator reveals that a single person earning $30,000 in Canada is considered to be in the high-income group worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This income translates to approximately $56 per day in [[cost_of_living_comparison_in_different_countries | purchasing power parity dollars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This figure is significantly higher than what most of the global population earns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Poverty and Essentials

Globally, many individuals live on just a few dollars a day, with limited access to basic essentials like clean water and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Experiencing extreme poverty firsthand can foster gratitude for one's own circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## The Value of Perspective

While a global perspective does not eliminate financial struggles, it can help individuals reframe their challenges and encourage making smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Purpose**: XDV is designed for investors looking for steady, high-quality dividends from strong Canadian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, choosing stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **Strong Dividend Payers**: Holds 31 of the highest-yielding Canadian stocks, selected for dividend consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions**: Provides monthly payouts, making it suitable for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   **Financials-Heavy**: Almost 60% of the ETF consists of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs**:
    *   **Dividend Yield**: Approximately 4.2% as of January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: 0.55% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This is higher than some alternatives but considered reasonable for a high-yield strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   **Assets Under Management (AUM)**: $1.76 billion, indicating its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: Dominated by Canadian financials, including Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These companies have strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Investor Profile**:
    *   **Ideal for**: Retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts and exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Not ideal for**: Growth investors, as it prioritizes income over capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Summary**: XDV is a solid choice for dividend investors wanting monthly income and exposure to stable, high-yield Canadian companies, but its heavy reliance on financial stocks and moderate fees should be noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

*   **Rank**: #4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Purpose**: ZWC is an income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks and uses a covered call strategy to enhance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy provides higher monthly dividends but limits upside potential from stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   **How Covered Calls Work**: ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks, earning premiums. If stock prices stay flat or fall, ZWC keeps the premium, boosting its dividend yield. However, if stock prices rise above a set strike price, ZWC must sell at that price, missing out on larger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This means ZWC trades growth potential for more stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Key Features**:
    *   **Enhanced Income Strategy**: Uses covered calls to generate extra income, resulting in a higher-than-average yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions**: Ideal for retirees or income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Diversified Canadian Portfolio**: Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs**:
    *   **Dividend Yield**: 6.62% as of February 27, 2025, which is higher than average due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 12% return, but the 5-year average is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **MER**: 0.72% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is higher than traditional dividend ETFs due to active options management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   **Trading Expense Ratio**: 0.2%, making the total cost 0.92% â€“ the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   **AUM**: $1.7 billion, making it very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: Heavily weighted towards financials and energy, including Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Investor Profile**:
    *   **Ideal for**: Retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow and don't need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Good for RSP and TFSA investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Not ideal for**: Growth-focused investors, as covered calls limit potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Summary**: ZWC is a strong choice for investors wanting high monthly income with reduced market volatility. Its covered call strategy limits upside potential, making it better suited for purely income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### 3. iShares S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)

    *   **MER**: 0.66% per year, slightly higher than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   **AUM**: Nearly $1 billion ($940 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: Less concentrated in financials compared to other dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Top holdings include BCE, Allied Properties REIT, Fiera Capital, Telus, and Southcorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This diversification can help reduce risk compared to bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Investor Profile**:
    *   **Ideal for**: Dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time and more diversification than bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   **Not ideal for**: Maximum yield seekers, as its dividend rates are lower than some other ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Summary**: CDZ is a great choice for long-term investors who value steady dividend growth and broad sector exposure. While its yield is lower than covered call ETFs, its focus on companies with strong dividend track records makes it a reliable option for sustainable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> [!TIP] Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP)
> For any of these ETFs, setting up a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) can help supercharge long-term gains by automatically reinvesting dividends to buy more units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Why Canadian Dividend ETFs Are Not Always Ideal

Despite the popularity and specific benefits of individual ETFs, Canadian dividend ETFs generally have several downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Higher Fees
*   Dividend ETFs often come with higher-than-average Management Expense Ratios (MERs) that can significantly impact returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   For example, XDV charges 0.55% MER but only holds 31 stocks, which is not great diversification for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. An investment of $1,000 in XDV would incur $5.50 per year in fees, which compounds and reduces long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   To mitigate this, investors should seek out lower MER dividend ETFs, like the top two on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Limited Diversification
*   Most Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   VDY, for instance, has over 85% exposure to just financials and energy, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   XDV holds only 31 stocks and XDIV only 20 stocks, meaning they don't provide broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   In contrast, truly diversified ETFs like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) hold over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies, areas where Canadian dividend ETFs are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   If true diversification is desired, [[investment_strategies_using_dividend_etfs_in_canada | dividend ETFs]] alone might not suffice, and building a personalized portfolio or choosing a globally diversified ETF like VGRO might be better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. For more information on broadly diversified options, consider checking out [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | All-in-One ETFs in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### Better Options in US Dividend Stocks
*   Many of the best dividend stocks are found in the U.S. market, offering potentially higher dividend growth rates, more sector diversification, and a greater selection of blue-chip companies with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might be better off investing directly in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   Another strategy could be to combine a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in U.S. dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

> [!TIP] Tax Efficiency for US Dividend Stocks
> For U.S. dividend stocks, consider holding them in an RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) rather than a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) to avoid withholding tax on the dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This is part of [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax-efficient investment strategies]].

While Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool for those who prefer not to buy individual stocks, they come with concerns such as high fees, lack of diversification, and reduced control over investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

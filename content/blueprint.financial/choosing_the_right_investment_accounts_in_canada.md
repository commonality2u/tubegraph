Choosing the appropriate investment account can significantly influence your after-tax returns in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The TFSA, RRSP, and FHSA each offer distinct tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Comparing Canadian Investment Accounts

An example of a $10,000 investment over 30 years at 6% growth, with a current tax rate of 40% and a future withdrawal tax rate of 20% for RRSP, demonstrates the differing outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)**
    *   The RRSP can lead with an after-tax balance of $64,327 in this example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   This is due to the upfront tax refund and tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   It is most effective if your retirement tax rate is considerably lower than your current tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)**
    *   The TFSA is a close second, growing to $57,434 entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   It is ideal for flexibility and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

*   **First Home Savings Account (FHSA)**
    *   While not explicitly detailed in the example, the FHSA is mentioned alongside TFSA and RRSP as offering unique tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

*   **Non-Registered Account**
    *   A non-registered account, where annual growth is taxed at 40%, only grows to $28,896 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   This demonstrates how annual taxation significantly limits compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Setting Up and Funding Your Account

### Placing Your Order

*   **ETFs**: Search for the ticker symbol (e.g., VFV for Vanguard S&P 500 ETF), decide on the number of shares, review costs, and place a market or limit order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Stocks**: The process is similar to ETFs; find the ticker and make the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

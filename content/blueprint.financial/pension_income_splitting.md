[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] can be an effective way to reduce taxable income and avoid the OAS clawback, particularly when one spouse earns significantly less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This strategy allows you to transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to the lower-income spouse, helping to keep taxable income below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

*   **Reduce Taxable Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>: By transferring pension income to a lower-income spouse, the higher-income spouse's taxable income is reduced, potentially moving them into a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Avoid OAS Clawback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>: Reducing the higher-income spouse's taxable income can help keep their total income below the OAS clawback threshold of $9,997, preserving full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Lower Overall Tax Burden** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>: When the lower-income spouse is taxed on the transferred amount, the couple pays less tax overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Income Disparity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>: This strategy is especially valuable for [[income_splitting_strategies_for_couples | couples]] where one spouse earns significantly more than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Example: Peter and Mary Jane

Consider Peter Parker, who earns $60,000 annually from his pension, and his wife, Mary Jane, who earns a much lower amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

By using [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]]:
*   Peter can transfer $30,000 (50%) of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Mary Jane, being in a lower tax bracket, is taxed on the $30,000 she receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   Overall, they pay less tax as a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   Crucially, by reducing Peter's taxable income, they can keep his total income below the OAS clawback threshold of $9,997, protecting his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] can be a complex topic, but it offers significant tax savings for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Some individuals have saved over six figures in taxes through these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It's akin to a carefully choreographed dance where both partners need to move in harmony to avoid high taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Splitting Employer-Sponsored Pension Income

[[pension_income_splitting_strategies | Pension income splitting]] allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This strategy focuses on employer-sponsored pensions, not Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, which are covered separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Eligibility Rules

Eligibility for [[pension_income_splitting_as_a_method_to_lower_taxable_income | pension income splitting]] depends on the type of pension income and whether individuals are under or over the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. The two main types of employer-sponsored pension income are Defined Benefit Pension Plans (DBPP) and Defined Contribution Pension Plans (DCPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

#### Before Age 65

*   **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP)**: Income from a DBPP qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] prior to age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP)**: Withdrawals from a DCPP generally do not qualify before the age of 65, unless the spouse passes away, which triggers special rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

#### After Age 65

*   Both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution income are eligible for [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] after the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Withdrawals from Registered Income Funds (RIFs) and Life Income Funds (LIFs) also become eligible, simplifying tax balancing for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin's Pension Splitting

Consider Ted and Robin, who are retired and in their 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   Ted receives $40,000 annually from his pension, taxed at his marginal rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Robin has very little income and falls into a much lower tax bracket of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

By utilizing [[pension_income_splitting_strategies | pension income splitting]], Ted can shift some of his pension income to Robin, resulting in lower overall taxes for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

#### Effectiveness

*   **Without Splitting**: Ted would pay $12,000 in taxes himself, as his entire $40,000 income is taxed at his 30% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **With Splitting**: By splitting 20% of his income ($8,000) with Robin, she is taxed at her much lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This strategy results in a combined tax saving of $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

This example simplifies the scenario by assuming they remain in their respective marginal tax rates, which in practice requires careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

[[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is a complex but effective way to manage taxes, potentially leading to significant savings for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's like a choreographed dance where both partners need to move in harmony to avoid high taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Pension [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | income splitting]] is one strategy that allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This method is specifically for employer-sponsored pension income and differs from [[cpp_income_splitting | CPP income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## How it Works
The process involves shifting a portion of pension income from the higher-earning spouse to the lower-earning spouse to reduce the overall household tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Eligibility Rules
Eligibility for pension [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | income splitting]] varies based on the type of pension income and whether individuals are under or over the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Employer-sponsored pensions generally fall into two main types:

*   **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>
*   **Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

### Before Age 65
*   **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP):** Income from a DBPP qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | income splitting]] prior to age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP):** Withdrawals from a DCPP generally do not qualify before age 65, unless specific conditions apply (e.g., spouse passes away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### After Age 65
*   **Both DBPP and DCPP:** After the age of 65, income from both defined benefit and defined contribution plans becomes eligible for [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **RRIFs and LIFs:** Withdrawals from Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) and Life Income Funds (LIFs) also become eligible, simplifying the balancing of taxable income for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Example
Consider Ted and Robin, who are retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
> Ted receives $40,000 annually from his pension, taxed at his marginal rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Robin has very little income, falling into a much lower tax bracket of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
>
> By using [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | pension income splitting]], Ted can shift some of his pension income to Robin, resulting in less taxes paid overall for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
>
> Without splitting, Ted would pay the full $12,000 in taxes himself (30% of $40,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. By splitting 20% of his income (i.e., $8,000) with Robin, she gets taxed at her lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This saves them $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Benefits
The primary benefit of [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | pension income splitting]] is the reduction of the household tax bill by shifting income to the lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

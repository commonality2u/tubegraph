The Home Buyers Plan (HBP) allows individuals to withdraw funds from their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to purchase or build a first home [00:01:48]. It is a significant tool that, when combined with other savings accounts, can help Canadians achieve homeownership [00:00:10].

## RRSP Contributions

The RRSP is a well-established savings vehicle for retirement in Canada [00:01:54].
*   **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to 18% of your income annually, with a maximum contribution of $31,500 [00:01:59].
*   **Tax Benefits**: Contributions to an RRSP are tax-deductible, similar to the First Home Savings Account (FHSA), providing a tax break each year you contribute [00:00:41]. This is one of the [[tax_advantages_for_firsttime_home_buyers_in_canada | tax advantages for first-time home buyers in Canada]].

## How the Home Buyers Plan (HBP) Works

The HBP allows you to withdraw funds from your RRSP tax-free to put towards your first home [00:02:29].
*   **Withdrawal Limit**: You can withdraw up to $60,000 from your RRSP through the HBP [00:03:11, 00:07:33].
*   **Spousal Option**: If you are buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, the combined withdrawal limit doubles to $120,000 [00:02:32, 00:03:11].
*   **Repayment Obligation**: Unlike the FHSA, funds withdrawn under the HBP must be repaid to your RRSP [00:02:37]. The repayment period is 15 years, starting five years after the withdrawal [00:02:40].
*   **Consequences of Non-Repayment**: If you miss a repayment, that amount is added to your taxable income for the year, which will increase your tax burden [00:02:45].

For first-time home buyers, [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_purchase | combining the FHSA and HBP]] can significantly boost your down payment savings [00:00:10, 00:03:16].

*   **Individual Savings Potential**: A single individual can save up to $100,000 by combining the FHSA ($40,000 lifetime limit) and HBP ($60,000 withdrawal limit) [00:03:45].
*   **Couple's Savings Potential**: For a couple, the potential savings double. For example, Ross and Rachel combined their FHSAs to save $80,000 and tapped into their RRSPs through the HBP, withdrawing $60,000 each for a combined $120,000. This allowed them to accumulate $200,000 for their down payment, all tax-free [00:02:54, 00:03:00, 00:03:08, 00:03:16]. If they let their FHSA grow for an additional 10 years, their combined FHSA balance could reach over $160,000. By adding the $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals, they could have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment tax-free [00:05:05, 00:05:24, 00:05:31].

## Tax Advantages of Using RRSP for Home Purchase

Using tax-advantaged accounts like the RRSP (via HBP) and FHSA offers significant [[tax_advantages_for_firsttime_home_buyers_in_canada | tax advantages for first-time home buyers]] [00:08:00].
*   **Tax Deductible Contributions**: Contributions to these accounts are tax-deductible, meaning you don't pay taxes on that income [00:08:33]. This allows you to save the full amount without income tax reducing your savings [00:08:37].
*   **Impact on Savings Goal**: To save $200,000 without tax benefits, someone with a 30% tax rate would need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 after taxes, an additional $85,000 [00:08:07, 00:08:17, 00:08:23]. By using the FHSA and RRSP, you only need to save the $200,000, as every dollar contributes directly towards the home purchase [00:08:42, 00:08:45].

Using these tools makes homeownership more achievable, even in challenging housing markets like Canada's [00:07:45, 00:07:52].

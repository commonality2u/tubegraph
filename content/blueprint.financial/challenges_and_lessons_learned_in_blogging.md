The journey of building a successful finance blog like "wealth awesome.com" came with its share of challenges and provided many valuable lessons, both technical and personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Initial Hurdles and Time to Monetization

Starting a blog and earning income was not an easy path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Delayed Income** The first dollar, a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade, was earned about a year after the site's launch in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **Significant Effort for Little Return (Initially)** By the time the first income was generated in November 2020, the founder had written over 150 articles and spent hundreds of hours working on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Slow Start in Traffic** The website initially grew very slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. It wasn't until about 11 months into the journey, after writing around 100 articles, that the site started gaining traction, reaching approximately 5,000 visitors per month in August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

## Technical Skills Acquired

Before starting "wealth awesome," the founder had never built a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. The experience necessitated learning a wide array of technical skills:
*   Website design and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>
*   Search Engine Optimization (SEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>
*   Writing and graphic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>
*   Analyzing website data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>
*   Building an affiliate partner network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>
*   Website monetization strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>
*   Hiring and managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>
*   Using various online tools for business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>

Past professional experiences, such as an analyst role, business-to-business sales, and financial advisory, significantly contributed to the site's growth by aiding in SEO analysis, promotion, and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## Personal and Business Management Lessons

Running the blog was the founder's first experience managing a "real business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. This journey taught crucial lessons in managing the inherent [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes_and_pitfalls | ups and downs of running a business]]:
*   **Emotional Resilience** Initially, the founder was highly reactive to results, experiencing upset with bad outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. A key lesson learned was to "ride out the bad results and carry on with my work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Imperfection** It was realized that despite doing everything "by the book," things would break, results wouldn't always go as planned, and there would be times of questioning motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The understanding that "you can't fix everything" became clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.
*   **Developing Mental Toughness** This was identified as "probably the most important thing" learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **Recognizing the Role of Timing and Luck** The success of the site was partly attributed to good timing, as it started just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people were online and interested in personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
*   **Focusing on Controllables** A core takeaway was that while everything cannot be controlled, one can always control their reaction to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling and Moving On

The decision to sell the site stemmed from several factors, highlighting the [[reasons_for_selling_the_blog_and_moving_on | challenges faced by retirees in saving for retirement | challenges faced by retirees in saving for retirement]] of sustained engagement:
*   **Loss of Passion** After several years, the founder began to lose passion for the daily tasks of producing content and found it harder to motivate themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. A key lesson was to recognize when the "fire" is gone, signaling it's "time for me to move on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty about the Future of Blogging** Concerns arose regarding the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, causing stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.
*   **Opportunity for a New Chapter** The site was eventually sold to a close friend and former colleague, which was a "super random" but positive outcome, ensuring the site went to someone trusted with fresh ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

The overall experience of owning the site was overwhelmingly positive, changing the founder's life and helping many others with financial education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

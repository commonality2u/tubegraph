Retirement marks a significant [[mindset_shift_from_saving_to_spending_in_retirement | mindset shift]] from decades of saving and investing to actually spending what has been accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This transition often leads to a common [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save or spend dilemma]] where retirees hesitate to enjoy their wealth, even when prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Many retirees struggle to move from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset, impacting their confidence in using their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Downside of Under-spending

Not spending enough in retirement can lead to several negative outcomes:

*   **Missed Experiences and Opportunities** Retirees who hesitate to spend might miss out on fulfilling experiences such as travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enhance their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are the moments that make retirement fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Healthspan vs. Lifespan** Peter Attia's book *Outlive* highlights the distinction between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting enjoyment of saved funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Inflation's Impact** Inflation erodes the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While a properly structured [[financial_planning_for_retirees | retirement plan]] should account for inflation to maintain purchasing power, under-spending may mean missing out on opportunities to utilize funds before their value diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## The Upside of Cautious Spending

Despite the downsides, a degree of caution in spending can also be beneficial:

*   **Encourages Thoughtful Spending** Hesitation can promote deliberate and well-considered financial decisions, preventing impulse purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Helps Money Last (Reducing Longevity Risk)** A careful approach ensures funds stretch further, reducing the risk of running out of money prematurely, which is a common concern for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This is known as reducing longevity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk (Sequence of Returns Risk)** Market losses early in retirement can significantly deplete a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Spending cautiously helps protect against this "sequence of returns risk," even if markets eventually recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Aligns with Legacy Goals** For many, a significant priority is leaving an inheritance for loved ones or contributing to charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Being cautious with spending allows retirees to achieve these legacy goals while still enjoying their own retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

In essence, while not spending enough can be detrimental, it can also serve as a protective measure, enhancing financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance: The Role of Financial Planning

The key to resolving the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save vs. spend dilemma]] is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. A major challenge for retirees is not knowing how much they can safely spend, leading to natural caution to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, this caution might prevent them from enjoying the wealth they worked hard to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This is where a well-structured [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial plan]] becomes essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. A plan can clearly outline affordable spending levels and use stress testing to evaluate an investment portfolio's resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This process helps shift retirees from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Case Studies in Balancing Spending

### Michael and Karen: Increasing Spending with Confidence

*   **Client Profile** Michael (66) and Karen (64) had a combined annual income of $180,000 from pensions (CPP, OAS, work pensions) and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Their yearly expenses were $70,000, covering basic living, travel, and discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They had $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their goal was to increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving, but they were unsure how much more they could spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Process** Michael and Karen were living comfortably but conservatively, despite a $110,000 annual surplus ($180,000 income - $70,000 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Analysis showed that with their $4 million portfolio and a sustainable 3.5% withdrawal rate, they could easily withdraw an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams already covered basic expenses, leaving investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution** Stress testing their portfolio involved modeling a 30% decline in value during early retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Even under this scenario, their portfolio remained safe for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Longevity projections, assuming they lived to age 95, indicated their portfolio would last well beyond their predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Outcome** Armed with this information, Michael and Karen felt confident spending more freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. They booked luxury vacations, started home renovations, and increased charitable contributions, enjoying retirement without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Robert and Susan: Balancing Spending and Legacy Goals

*   **Client Profile** Robert (70) and Susan (68) had a combined annual income of $100,000 and expenses of $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. They had $1.2 million in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Their goal was to leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their own retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Process** Robert and Susan were cautious with their spending due to their inheritance goals, despite a healthy income and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A financial review showed their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide an additional $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This, combined with their $100,000 income, provided more than enough to cover their $75,000 expenses and allow for increased spending flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Solution** To balance their lifestyle and legacy goals, a slight increase in spending from $75,000 to $85,000 per year was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This allowed for more funds towards travel and experiences while maintaining their inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Portfolio stress testing, factoring in potential market downturns, confirmed they could comfortably maintain their spending without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Outcome** With the new spending plan, Robert and Susan gained confidence to enjoy a higher quality of life now, knowing they could still leave a meaningful inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach helped them strike the right balance between enjoying retirement and achieving long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pro Tip
> The larger a client's portfolio, the harder it can be to convince them to spend more money, often due to deeply ingrained strict savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For those with substantial wealth, easing into spending by setting small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies can help gradually shift one's mindset and enhance retirement enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

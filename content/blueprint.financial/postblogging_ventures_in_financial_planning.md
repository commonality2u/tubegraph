After successfully building and selling the finance blog "Wealth Awesome," the creator has transitioned into a new venture focused on financial planning for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This shift aligns with a long-held passion for helping individuals optimize their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Transition from Blogging
The decision to sell Wealth Awesome stemmed from a loss of passion for doing the same thing after several years, leading to a decreased excitement for working on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. There was also uncertainty about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, a shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, which caused stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The site was sold to a trusted friend who could bring fresh ideas and manage its new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## Blueprint Financial: A New Chapter
The creator is now embarking on a new business venture called Blueprint Financial, a financial planning company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Mission and Services
Blueprint Financial aims to build customized [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial plans]] for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The core belief behind this venture is that most people have not fully [[balancing_spending_and_longterm_financial_security | optimized their finances]], and the company can bring significant value to individuals and businesses across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Personal Connection and Value
The creator was approached by experienced business partners to start this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The value of these financial plans was first tested personally and then with family members, revealing immense benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This has led to adding peace of mind and significant potential financial gains for clients' [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | retirements]], helping them to reach their [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

The experience as a financial advisor in a previous corporate role was a favorite, providing intimate one-on-one connections with clients and their families, which offered a great deal of personal satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

## Future Content and Gratitude
The creator plans to continue providing valuable and free personal finance content on their YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The journey thus far, including living in numerous countries like Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bali, Mexico, and Canada, has been overwhelmingly positive and life-changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The support from readers and viewers has been crucial, allowing for a real impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

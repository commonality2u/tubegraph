When planning to [[steps_to_consider_before_moving_abroad | leave Canada]] permanently, managing your finances carefully is crucial to avoid significant losses, potentially thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. One area that demands particular attention is your principal residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Why Sell Before Leaving?

It is highly recommended to consider selling your home before you [[steps_to_consider_before_moving_abroad | leave Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This strategic move can help you avoid substantial taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Selling your principal residence while you are still a resident of Canada means that Canada does not tax the capital gains from its sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Potential Tax Implications of Not Selling

Selling your principal residence after you have become a non-resident can lead to severe financial consequences due to large capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The capital gains tax would apply to any increase in the home's value that occurs *after* you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The amount of tax depends on your [[understanding_tax_residency_status_when_leaving_canada | residency status]] and any applicable tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider this example to understand the potential cost of not selling your home before becoming a non-resident:
If you bought your home for $500,000 and its value appreciated to $800,000, and you then decide to [[steps_to_consider_before_moving_abroad | move abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. If you sell the home *after* you become a non-resident, you might have to pay capital gains tax on the $300,000 increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This could result in a significant tax bill, potentially upwards of $75,000 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This substantial tax bill could have been entirely avoided by selling the property before [[steps_to_consider_before_moving_abroad | leaving Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

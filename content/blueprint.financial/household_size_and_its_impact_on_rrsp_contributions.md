Larger households generally tend to contribute more to their Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), likely due to having more income available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Contribution Patterns by Household Type
*   **Two-person households** lead in RRSP contributions, with 4.2 million such households contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Their median contribution was $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Single-person households** contribute significantly less overall, with a median contribution of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

This pattern suggests that dual-income households are often better positioned to prioritize and grow their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The more individuals contributing to a household's income, the greater the potential for savings and the ability to split costs, leading to more discretionary income for RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Financial planning, particularly for retirement, often depends on household dynamics and available resources, regardless of whether it's a smaller or larger household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

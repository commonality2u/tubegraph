Many Canadians express regret after contributing to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) without a solid investment plan. With numerous investment choices available, individuals may either experience decision paralysis and do nothing, or take on excessive risk, both of which can negatively impact long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls in RRSP Investing

### Too Many Investment Choices Leading to Paralysis
RRSPs permit investments in a wide array of options, including stocks, bonds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), mutual funds, and Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. However, this overwhelming number of choices can lead to decision paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Some contributors leave their RRSP funds dormant in cash or low-interest savings accounts, thereby missing out on years of potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Others might blindly follow recommendations for high-fee mutual funds from banks, unaware of how much these fees erode their long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Many regret not establishing a clear strategy from the outset and wish they had learned more about investment options before contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Taking on Excessive Risk
Some RRSP holders opt to invest heavily in high-risk stocks with the hope of achieving significant gains, without fully comprehending market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. When the market experiences a downturn, panic can set in, leading to hasty decisions and selling at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Many investors later regret not diversifying their portfolio, realizing that risk without a clear strategy is akin to gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Being Overly Conservative
Conversely, some investors are excessively cautious, keeping their RRSPs in low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or money market funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. While this approach avoids volatility, it also means their money barely keeps pace with inflation, which limits their potential retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Years later, many realize their savings did not grow sufficiently and wish they had adopted a more balanced approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid RRSP Investment Regrets

To prevent RRSP investment regrets, it is crucial to begin with a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Match Investments to Risk Tolerance**: Select investments that align with your personal risk tolerance, balancing growth-oriented assets like stocks with more stable options such as bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This helps in avoiding either too much or too little risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Opt for Low-Cost Options**: Choose low-cost ETFs or index funds instead of high-fee mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Avoid Idle Cash**: Do not leave cash sitting idle in your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

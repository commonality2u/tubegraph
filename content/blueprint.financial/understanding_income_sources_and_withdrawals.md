A crucial aspect of retirement planning involves having a clear understanding of your potential income sources and developing a strategic approach to withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This ensures a steady financial stream throughout your retirement years.

## Assessing Current and Future Income

Before retirement, it's vital to assess your current income and project how it will transition into your retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Case Study: Pam and Jim

For example, Pam and Jim Helper demonstrated strong income levels leading up to retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. In 2024, their combined employment income was $160,000, with additional sources bringing their total income to $190,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This consistent income allowed them to save comfortably and prepare for their long-term financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Strategic Withdrawals from Savings

A key component of managing your [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income]] is planning how and when to withdraw from your savings accounts.

### Pam and Jim's Withdrawal Strategy

Pam and Jim planned to make strategic withdrawals from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   When Jim turned 65 in 2042, they intended to begin withdrawing from their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   When Jim turned 71, they planned to start withdrawing from their RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
This gradual withdrawal approach helped them maximize their retirement savings and ensure a consistent income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Government Benefits: CPP and OAS

Government benefits like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) are significant [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income sources in Canada]].

### Optimizing CPP and OAS Benefits

Pam and Jim planned to start receiving both CPP and OAS benefits at age 65, expecting a combined total of almost $30,000 in 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

It's important to note that individuals can adjust when they start receiving these benefits:
*   **Delaying Benefits:** You can delay both CPP and OAS until age 70 for larger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Early Benefits:** Alternatively, you can start taking CPP as early as age 60, though this comes with a reduction of up to 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Pam and Jim's strategy of starting at 65 aligned well with their overall retirement plan, but the decision of when to start CPP and OAS should always be reassessed closer to retirement based on individual financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Aligning these decisions with your broader financial goals is key to maximizing your [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

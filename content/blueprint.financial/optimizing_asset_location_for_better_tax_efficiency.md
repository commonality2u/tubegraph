Optimizing your asset location is a key strategy for investment [[tax_saving_strategies | tax efficiency]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This approach focuses on *where* you hold your investments, rather than just what you invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Different types of income, such as interest, dividends, and capital gains, are taxed differently in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Canadian Tax Rules on Investment Income

Here's a breakdown of how different income types are taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>:

*   **Interest Income**
    *   Taxed at your full marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   Considered the least [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax efficient]] income type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Canadian Dividends**
    *   Benefit from the dividend tax credit, which lowers your effective tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Foreign Dividends and Interest**
    *   Subject to withholding taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   These taxes generally cannot be recovered in a [[TaxFree Savings Account Strategies | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains**
    *   Only 50% of capital gains are taxable up to $250,000; beyond that, it's two-thirds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   Generally more [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax efficient]] than interest or dividends in most situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Asset Location

### 1. RSP for US Dividend-Paying Stocks

Holding US dividend-paying stocks in your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) can help you avoid the 15% withholding tax on US dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This is due to the Canada-US tax treaty, ensuring you receive the full dividend amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### 2. TFSA for High-Growth Investments

Use your [[TaxFree Savings Account Strategies | TFSA]] to shelter capital gains and allow high-growth investments to compound tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. It's advisable to avoid foreign dividend stocks in a TFSA if possible, as withholding taxes apply and cannot be recovered in this account, leading to a loss of up to 15% of your dividends annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For example, investing in Apple stock in a TFSA means you would receive less dividend income than if it were held in an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### 3. Taxable Accounts for Canadian Dividend Stocks

If your registered accounts are maxed out, Canadian dividend-paying stocks can be a reasonable option for your taxable (non-registered) accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The dividend tax credit significantly reduces the taxes on these investments, making them more [[taxefficient_investment_strategies in Canada | tax efficient]] in a taxable account compared to other income types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. For instance, a $1,000 Canadian dividend for someone in a 30% tax bracket might result in an effective tax rate of only about 7%, meaning only around $70 in taxes, compared to $300 on the same amount of interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### 4. Registered Accounts for Interest-Generating Investments

Place investments that generate high-interest income, such as Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs) or Bonds, within your RSP or [[TaxFree Savings Account Strategies | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This strategy helps you avoid paying high taxes on interest income in taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

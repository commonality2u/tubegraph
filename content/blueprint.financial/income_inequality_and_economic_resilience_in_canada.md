This article explores the landscape of income distribution in Canada, focusing on the thresholds for top earners, the visible trends of income inequality, and the economic resilience observed among the highest income brackets.

## Income Thresholds for Top Earners in Canada

To understand income distribution, it's essential to define the thresholds for various high-income groups:

*   **Top 10%**
    *   As of 2022, an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income to join the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10% of individual income earners in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
    *   Within this group, the median income was $147,100, and the average income was $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   From 2018 to 2022, the threshold to enter the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10%]] rose by 14.3%, from $97,000 to approximately $111,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Top 5%**
    *   As of 2022, to enter the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 5%]] of earners in Canada, an individual needed to earn at least $147,100 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   The median income within this group was $193,800, and the average income was $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Between 2018 and 2022, the minimum income for the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 5%]] increased by 16.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

*   **Top 1%**
    *   To be in the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 1% of earners in Canada]] in 2022, an individual needed to earn at least $283,200 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   Within the [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]], the median income was $388,200, and the average income was $586,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   From 2018 to 2022, the threshold to enter the [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]] jumped by 15.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. During the same period, median incomes rose by nearly 14.7%, and average incomes by 18.3%, outpacing both inflation and broader wage growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Evidences of Income Inequality in Canada

Several indicators highlight growing [[income_growth_and_its_impact_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | income inequality]] in Canada:

*   **Widening Gap Between Median and Average Incomes**
    *   For the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10%]] in 2022, the average income was over $50,000 higher than the median income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This significant gap illustrates how a small number of ultra-high earners disproportionately elevate the average, indicating increasing income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Billionaires, such as Jim Patterson (estimated net worth over $11 billion), contribute to skewing this average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
    *   In the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 5%]], the average income exceeded the median by over $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, further signaling growing income concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   The [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]] saw their average income nearly $200,000 higher than their median income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This substantial difference clearly demonstrates the concentration of income among the ultra-elite, particularly the top 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

*   **Faster Income Growth for Top Earners**
    *   Both the median and average incomes for the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10%]] are rising faster than national income averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, contributing to a continued widening of income inequality in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Average incomes for the [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]] rose by 18.3% between 2018 and 2022, outpacing both inflation and broader wage growth in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, leading to the observation that "the rich truly do get richer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Consistent Membership in Top Brackets**
    *   Approximately 76% of [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 5%]] earners in 2022 were also in this group the previous year, and 86% had been in the top 5% at least once in the prior 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This suggests that many high earners maintain their top positions for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Around 69% of [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]] earners in 2022 were also in that group the year before, and 96% had been in the top 5% at least once in the past 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While challenging to enter, consistent membership is observed once in this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

*   **Comparison to Average Canadian Incomes**
    *   The median income for most Canadians ranges from $35,000 to about $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   The highest median income, for the 45-54 age group, is still $51,500 below the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10%]] threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   The [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_inc_earners_in_canada | top 5%]] threshold of $147,100 is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   To enter the [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]], one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34 year old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Economic Resilience Among Top Earners

Despite significant economic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, top earners have demonstrated considerable economic resilience:

*   Top earners continued to experience substantial [[income_growth_and_its_impact_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | income growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This highlights how this segment of the population remained relatively insulated from broader economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Tax Contributions by Top Earners

While enjoying higher incomes, top earners also make significant tax contributions:

*   The [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 5%]] of earners paid an average of $87,700 in income taxes in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This group, despite representing only 1 in 20 taxpayers, contributed over 41% of all federal and provincial personal income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   The [[understanding_the_top_1_percent_income_in_canada | top 1%]] earners paid an average of $231,600 in income taxes in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. They contributed over 22% of all federal and provincial income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

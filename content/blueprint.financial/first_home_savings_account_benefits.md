The [[first_home_savings_account_overview | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is a new registered account that helps Canadians save for their first home and is considered one of the best tax deductions available for a registered account, whether or not you plan to buy a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

It combines features from both the [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP)]] and the [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. It is recommended that anyone who qualifies should consider investing in an FHSA before contributing to their [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Key Benefits of the FHSA

*   **Flexibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>: If a home purchase does not occur, savings can be transferred to an [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **No Impact on [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] Room** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>: Contributions made to an FHSA do not affect an individual's [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **No Repayment Required** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>: Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan under an [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]], there is no requirement to repay amounts withdrawn from an FHSA when used for buying a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Tax-Deductible Contributions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>: [[firsttime_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | Contributions]] to an FHSA are tax deductible, similar to an [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals for Home Purchase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>: When used to purchase a home, withdrawals from an FHSA are completely tax-free, which can significantly enhance affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Continued Tax-Deferred Growth (if no home purchase)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>: If a home is not purchased, the funds can be transferred tax-free to an [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] or RRIF within 15 years, where savings will continue to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Eligibility

To qualify for an FHSA, an individual must be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>:
*   A Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   At least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   A first-time home buyer, meaning they have not owned a home in the current year or the previous four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Example Scenario (Sarah)

Sarah, 30 years old, plans to buy her first home in the next five years. She opens an FHSA and contributes $8,000 annually, with a marginal tax rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   After five years, she has contributed $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Her account grows to $50,000 with tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   She has saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

**Scenario 1: Sarah buys a home** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
Sarah withdraws the full $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment, significantly boosting her ability to afford the home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

**Scenario 2: Sarah doesn't buy a home** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
In 15 years, Sarah can transfer the entire amount in her FHSA to her [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | RSP]] or RRIF tax-free, allowing her savings to continue growing tax-deferred until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The FHSA offers a win-win situation, providing significant benefits whether an individual ultimately buys a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

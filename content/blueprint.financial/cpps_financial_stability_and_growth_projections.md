The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) faces public skepticism, with 64% of Canadians doubting its existence when they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concern is fueled by factors like aging populations, rising costs, and discussions about Alberta potentially leaving the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the CPP is more secure than many believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Its stability is supported by its strong financial performance, long-term sustainability, transparent reporting, and effective investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Outperforming Expectations

The CPP has consistently outperformed its financial projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return, pushing the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This total asset amount significantly exceeds initial expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

For instance, projections made in the year 2000 anticipated the CPP fund would reach $425 billion by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Instead, the fund reached $632 billion in 2023, surpassing projections by more than $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This indicates that the fund managers are making sound long-term decisions through smart [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The CPP fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even during challenging economic periods such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This robust growth ensures the CPP can easily handle the increasing number of retirees today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Sustainability for Generations

The long-term [[cpp_sustainability_and_longterm_planning | sustainability]] of the CPP is regularly assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Every three years, the chief actuary of Canada conducts a detailed review of the CPP's financial health, and the latest report confirms its stability for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The fund, currently at $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, is projected to grow substantially:
*   By 2030, the fund is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   By 2040, assets are projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   By 2050, the fund is expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

These forecasts demonstrate the fund's long-term potential and show that it is well-positioned to support both current retirees and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Projections indicate the CPP will likely remain financially stable for at least 75 years, extending its solvency into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting

The integrity of CPP reports and audits is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The CPP has multiple safeguards in place to ensure [[sustainability_and_trustworthiness_of_cpp_reporting | trustworthiness]]:
*   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** Provides an impartial assessment of the CPP's long-term financial health, operating independently of political influence to ensure accurate and unbiased reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 31st Actuarial Report, completed in 2022, confirmed the CPP's sustainability for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** Reviews these reports, adding another layer of independent, transparent, and nonpartisan scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The PBO's role is to provide objective factual analysis and ensure financial data is trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** Further assurance comes from external audits. Deloitte's 2022 audit, for example, confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal control over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

With independent oversight from both the chief actuary and the PBO, along with external audits confirming findings, there are strong reasons to trust the transparency of the CPP reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The CPP is considered one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Investment Performance and Management

The [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp | performance and management]] of CPP Investments are crucial to its long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Strong Long-Term Returns
CPP Investments has delivered a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This performance has propelled the fund's assets to $632 billion, exceeding projections by over $150 billion, showcasing the success of its investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Diversified Global Portfolio
The fund maintains a globally diversified portfolio across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It invests in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. With only 12% of the portfolio invested in Canada, the majority is spread across international markets, which helps reduce home risk by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Active Management Strategy
CPP Investments employs an active management approach to achieve returns by investing in areas such as infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term, though it may underperform in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. For example, the CPP's 8% net return for fiscal 2024, while strong, fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, for a pension fund like the CPP, active management is essential to address the complexities of pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The significant growth of CPP assets, reaching $632 billion, demonstrates sound investment management over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

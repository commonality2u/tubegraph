All-in-one ETFs, also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by bundling multiple Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They provide instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets, eliminating the need to pick individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This means investors can set up their investments once without constant rebalancing, second-guessing, or endless research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How All-in-One ETFs Work

All-in-one ETFs invest in a broad range of underlying assets. For example, Vanguard VGRO, one of the most trusted all-in-one ETFs in Canada with over $6 billion in assets under management, provides exposure to a wide array of global stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

A typical allocation for an all-in-one ETF like VGRO includes:
*   **Stocks** (80% allocation): A mix of Canadian, U.S., international, and emerging market stocks, offering access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Bonds** (20% allocation): A blend of Canadian and global bonds, which helps to stabilize a portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

This diversification strategy spreads investments across different countries, industries, and asset classes to reduce risk and potentially enhance returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. All-in-one ETFs typically come with a low fee, such as VGRO's 0.24% Management Expense Ratio (MER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The top 10 holdings of VGRO include major companies in both the U.S. and Canadian markets, such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, RBC, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Performance Example
An investment of $10,000 into VGRO from January 2020 to 2025 would have grown to approximately $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This demonstrates the potential of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Benefits of All-in-One ETFs

Investors often favor all-in-one ETFs for several key reasons:

*   **Low-Cost Alternative to Mutual Funds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>: All-in-one ETFs typically charge a significantly lower MER, usually between 0.2% to 0.25%, compared to traditional [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | mutual funds in Canada]], which often charge around 2% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Automatic Rebalancing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>: These ETFs automatically adjust their internal asset mix to maintain the target stock-to-bond ratio, eliminating the need for manual rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Smaller Accounts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>: For those starting with a TFSA, RRSP, or other investment account, a single all-in-one ETF provides instant diversification without needing to spread money across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Diversification and Time Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>: Instead of researching and buying dozens of stocks and bonds, investors get a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of investments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This "set it and forget it" approach makes investing more like "watching paint dry or watching grass grow," as economist Paul Samuelson described it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Who Should Use All-in-One ETFs?

All-in-one ETFs are particularly suitable for:
*   **Beginners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>: Individuals new to investing who want a simple, low-maintenance portfolio without the complexities of picking stocks or rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Busy Professionals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>: Those with demanding careers or businesses who lack the time to manage investments actively but want their money to work in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Parents Investing for Kids' Futures** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>: Ideal for investing in RESPs or other long-term savings accounts for a child's education, providing instant diversification and low maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>: Investors starting with a smaller TFSA or RRSP account who desire immediate diversification and exposure to thousands of stocks and bonds without needing multiple purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Choosing an All-in-One ETF

When choosing an all-in-one ETF, the most critical factor is selecting the right asset allocation for your risk tolerance and investment goals, rather than focusing on the ETF brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. For more guidance, see [[how_to_choose_the_right_allinone_etf]].

The Canadian ETF landscape features several major providers offering high-quality all-in-one ETFs:
*   **iShares (BlackRock)**: Known for ETFs like XGRO, XBAL, and XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Vanguard**: Offers popular options such as VGRO, VBAL, and VEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **BMO**: Provides ZGRO, ZBAL, and ZEQT, which offer strong diversification and the backing of a big bank brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Horizons**: Offers unique swap-based ETFs designed for tax efficiency in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

These providers all offer low-cost, diversified, and auto-rebalancing ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

To determine your ideal all-in-one ETF, consider your comfort with risk and match it to the asset allocation:
*   **Higher Risk, Higher Returns**: 100% stocks, 0% bonds (e.g., VEQT, XEQT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Balanced Approach with Growth**: 80% stocks, 20% bonds (e.g., VGRO, XGRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Lower Risk, Steady Growth**: 60% stocks, 40% bonds (e.g., VBAL, XBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Conservative, More Stability**: 40% stocks, 60% bonds (e.g., VCNS, XCNS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## How to Invest in All-in-One ETFs Step-by-Step

Here is a step-by-step guide to investing in all-in-one ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For a more detailed guide, see [[steps_to_invest_in_allinone_etfs]].

1.  **Determine Your Risk Tolerance**: Use free tools like the Vanguard Investor Questionnaire to assess your comfort with market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals. This helps you choose between aggressive (e.g., VEQT) or balanced (e.g., VBAL) ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
2.  **Choose a Brokerage**: You'll need an investment account to buy your ETF. Popular options in Canada include:
    *   **Well Simple Trade & Questrade**: Offer zero commission fees, great for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Big Bank Platforms (e.g., TD Direct Investing, RBC Direct Investing)**: Convenient for those who already bank with them, though they may have higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    Ensure you open the right type of account (TFSA, RRSP, or non-registered) based on your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
3.  **Buy the ETF**:
    *   Log into your brokerage account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Search for the ETF by its ticker symbol (e.g., VGRO or ZBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   Enter the number of shares you want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Choose a "market order" to buy immediately or a "limit order" to set a specific price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
4.  **Optional: Set up DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan)**: Enable this feature in your brokerage settings or by contacting customer support. It automatically reinvests any dividends received to buy more shares, helping compound growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### One Fund Enough?
Yes, all-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments for each account. Adding more funds can disrupt the carefully designed balance of the ETF, potentially altering your intended asset allocation and risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For example, VGRO already includes 13,000 companies, providing ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

However, if you wish to experiment beyond a single all-in-one ETF, you can use separate accounts for different strategies:
*   **TFSA**: Keep it simple with a single all-in-one ETF like VGRO for long-term tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **RRSP**: Build your own stock portfolio if you want to pick individual stocks, while keeping a portion passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account**: Focus on tax-efficient ETFs, such as Horizon's swap-based ETFs, to minimize taxes on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Common All-in-One ETF Mistakes to Avoid

Even with their simplicity, investors often make mistakes that can hinder returns. For more details, see [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_with_allinone_etfs]].

<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">Common Mistakes</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Not Honestly Completing the Investor Questionnaire</strong> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>: Failing to answer truthfully can lead to choosing an ETF that doesn't match your actual comfort level with risk. Being too conservative might limit growth, while being too aggressive could lead to panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Getting Bored and Tweaking Too Much</strong> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>: The "set it and forget it" approach is a major advantage. Constantly checking accounts, making unnecessary changes, or selling due to market swings can significantly hurt long-term returns. Patience is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account</strong> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>: Some investors mistakenly buy multiple all-in-one ETFs or combine them with other ETFs, believing it adds extra diversification. This only messes up the built-in balance and complicates the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Pick one that fits your risk tolerance and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.</p>

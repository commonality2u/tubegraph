Old Age Security (OAS) payments from the government can be a significant part of retirement income, potentially reaching up to $948 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, this entire amount can be clawed back by the government if a retiree's income exceeds certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This mechanism is known as the OAS clawback or recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## What is the OAS Clawback?

The [[oas_clawback_threshold_and_strategies_to_minimize_repayment | OAS clawback]] is triggered when an individual's income surpasses a specific threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If income reaches or exceeds $153,700 annually, or $8,619 annually for those age 75 and over ($9,481 annually), the clawback applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The recovery tax is applied at a rate of 15% on the amount of income exceeding the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Example Scenario: David

Consider David, a 75-year-old OAS recipient in 2024, whose income is $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Since his income is well over the clawback threshold, he will lose all his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The 15% recovery tax on the amount over the $90,995 threshold totals $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. As David's annual OAS benefit of $9,481 is less than this amount, he will receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_reduce_or_eliminate_the_oas_clawback | Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the OAS Clawback]]

There are several strategies to reduce or entirely avoid the OAS clawback, potentially saving retirees over $9,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### 1. Delay CPP Payments

One of the most effective strategies is to delay Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This approach not only increases CPP payments by up to 42% but also lowers taxable income between the ages of 65 and 70, when the OAS clawback often begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For instance, delaying a $1,000 monthly CPP payment from age 65 to 70 would increase it to $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Example: Peter Parker**
    Peter Parker, at age 65, faces an OAS clawback of $811 due to high taxable income from CPP and other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By delaying CPP, his taxable income is reduced, leading to a smaller OAS clawback of $584, representing a savings of over $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This strategy also secures higher, inflation-indexed CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### 2. Delay OAS Payments

Delaying OAS payments up to age 70 is another smart strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This increases monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, providing more income later while potentially reducing or eliminating the clawback during earlier retirement years when income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. A $500 monthly OAS payment at age 65 would become $680 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

*   **Example: Peter Parker (continued)**
    If Peter delays his OAS until age 70, the entire clawback of $811 is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This is particularly effective when income is high between ages 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Peter also receives a 36% higher monthly OAS payment after age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Delaying CPP and OAS may not be beneficial for everyone, especially those with health issues or shorter life expectancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### 3. [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | Use TFSA Wisely]]

A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is an excellent tool to avoid the OAS clawback because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This allows access to funds for living expenses without increasing taxable income, helping to stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Example**: Withdrawing $20,000 annually from a $100,000 TFSA does not incur taxes or count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In contrast, withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like an RRSP could push income over the threshold, triggering the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip: RRSP to TFSA Ladder**: Consider gradually withdrawing from an RRSP and contributing to a TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This keeps taxable income lower later on and allows tax-free withdrawals from the TFSA in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### 4. [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | Pension Income Splitting]]

Pension income splitting can significantly reduce taxable income and avoid the OAS clawback, especially when one spouse earns much less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Up to 50% of eligible pension income can be transferred to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

*   **Example: Peter Parker and Mary Jane**
    If Peter earns $60,000 annually from his pension and Mary Jane earns less, Peter can transfer $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000, putting him in a lower tax bracket and reducing the risk of the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Mary Jane, in a lower tax bracket, is taxed on the $30,000 she receives, resulting in less overall tax for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### 5. Manage RIF Withdrawals

Upon turning 71, an RRSP converts into a Registered Income Fund (RIF), requiring minimum annual withdrawals that are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These withdrawals can push income over the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Strategies to minimize this impact include using a younger spouse's age to reduce the withdrawal rate or first tapping into non-taxable accounts like a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

*   **Example: Peter and Mary Jane (again)**
    If Peter is 71 and Mary Jane is 65, they can use Mary Jane's younger age to reduce Peter's RIF withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Normally, Peter would withdraw 5.28% from his RIF at age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. By basing it on Mary Jane's age, the rate drops to 4%, meaning $8,000 withdrawn from a $200,000 RIF instead of $10,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This reduces taxable income by $2,560, helping them stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### 6. [[investment_strategies_and_managing_withdrawals_to_maintain_oas_benefits_in_retirement | Invest Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts]]

The type of income earned from non-registered accounts significantly impacts taxable income and can trigger the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Interest income** from bonds, GICs, or savings accounts is fully taxable at the marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Capital gains** are only taxed at 50% of the marginal tax rate (if under the $250,000 threshold), making them more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, retirees can reduce their taxable income and stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. For example, if a portfolio generates $10,000 in interest income, the full amount is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. If it generates $10,000 in capital gains, only $5,000 is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### 7. [[tax_loss_harvesting_and_managing_capital_gains | Capture Capital Gains Before Age 65]]

Timing is crucial when managing capital gains to avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Realizing capital gains *before* turning 65 can prevent large taxable events once OAS benefits begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While capital gains are taxed favorably, large gains can still push income over the clawback threshold during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

A smart approach is to realize these gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This allows taxes to be paid earlier and avoids increasing taxable income during the critical years when OAS is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. For example, selling a property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain doesn't count towards taxable income during OAS eligibility, keeping income under the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Effective [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | retirement planning]] involves being aware of how strategies like delaying CPP and OAS, utilizing TFSAs, and managing RIF withdrawals can help avoid the OAS clawback and preserve more benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. These smart moves can potentially save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. For complex cases, such as those involving retirement properties or businesses, personalized planning is highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

The average cost of raising a child in Canada is a significant $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) can provide families with up to $125,500 per child, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Maximum CCB Payments

If a family qualifies for the maximum CCB, the payments over 18 years can break down as follows:
*   For children under six, the annual maximum is $7,778 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   For children aged 6 to 17, the annual maximum is $6,570 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, adding up to $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Combined, this totals up to $125,500 over 18 years per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

There is no limit to the number of children for whom a family can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   One child: approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Two children: doubles to $251,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Three children: totals $376,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   A family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Cost of Raising a Child in Canada

The average cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 is estimated at $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, or about $17,235 per year, for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   Families earning over $135,000 annually spend even more, averaging $431,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   For a lower-income family in Canada, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Understanding the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The CCB is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Indexed to Inflation**: The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Usage of Funds
There are no restrictions on how CCB money can be spent; it can be used for food, housing, education, or other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Eligibility and [[impact_of_family_income_on_ccb_payments | Calculations]]
The CCB is based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. If married or in a common-law relationship, this combines both spouses' incomes minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. As your net income increases, your CCB decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

The reduction occurs in two stages based on your family's net income:
1.  **Stage 1**: If your income is between $36,525 and $79,819 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
2.  **Stage 2**: If your income is above approximately $79,000 (after the initial reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over this $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

#### Example of CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six
*   Families earning $35,000 or less receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   At $50,000 net income, the annual benefit is reduced to about $6,884, or $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   At $100,000 family net income, the annual benefit drops to around $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   At $130,000 net income, the benefit further reduces to about $1,814 per year, or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   At very high income levels, the benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

For exact numbers, it's recommended to use the CRA's CCB calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Receiving Payments
Getting the CCB is straightforward:
*   Once you file your taxes, the CRA automatically calculates your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. No extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   As long as you and your partner file taxes annually and your child is registered with the government, payments will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   To receive payments faster, set up direct deposit with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   CCB payment dates are typically between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Important Updates
Keep your information up to date with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:
*   If your family's income changes due to job loss or life events like marriage, divorce, or the birth of a new baby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Changes in shared custody arrangements should also be reported, as the CRA typically splits payments 50/50 in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of the CCB

The CCB was introduced as a key tool to reduce child poverty and support families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has significantly impacted:
*   It helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   In 2021, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   The CCB also aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

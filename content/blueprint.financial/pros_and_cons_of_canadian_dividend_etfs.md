The following is a ranking and [[canadian_dividend_etfs_rankings_and_analysis | analysis]] of five prominent Canadian dividend ETFs, highlighting their [[features_and_performance_of_top_canadian_dividend_etfs | features and performance]], which shed light on their pros and cons.

### 5. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

*   **Focus**: Designed for investors seeking steady, high-quality dividends from strong Canadian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, selecting stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Holdings**: Holds 31 high-yielding Canadian stocks chosen for dividend consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Sector Concentration**: Nearly 60% of XDV is made up of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Top holdings include Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Dividend**: Offers monthly distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, with a dividend yield of approximately 4.2% as of January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Fees**: Management Expense Ratio (MER) is 0.55% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Suitability**: Ideal for retirees and income investors looking for monthly payouts and exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Not suitable for growth investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

*   **Focus**: An income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks and employs a covered call strategy to enhance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy means higher monthly dividends but limited upside potential from stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Covered Call Strategy**: ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks to earn extra income (premiums), capping potential gains. If stock prices stay flat or fall, ZWC keeps the premium, boosting its dividend yield. If prices rise above the strike price, ZWC sells at a set price, missing out on bigger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Holdings**: Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Top holdings include Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Dividend**: Offers monthly distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, with a very high dividend yield of 6.62% as of February 27th, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Fees**: MER is 0.72%, plus a trading expense ratio of 0.2%, totaling 0.92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This makes it the most expensive ETF on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Suitability**: Best for retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow and do not need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It can be a great place to hold within a TFSA to shield high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Not ideal for growth-focused investors due to capped gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

*   **Fees**: MER is 0.66% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Suitability**: Great for dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time and broader diversification than bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Fees**: Very low MER of 0.22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Suitability**: Strong low-cost option for investors focused on high monthly dividend income and comfortable with significant financials and energy sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## General Pros of Canadian Dividend ETFs

*   **Consistent Income**: Many Canadian dividend ETFs offer monthly distributions, making them ideal for income-focused investors and retirees seeking consistent cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Access to Stable Companies**: They provide exposure to Canada's largest, most stable dividend-paying companies, often with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Simplicity**: For those who prefer not to buy individual dividend stocks, ETFs offer a convenient tool to gain dividend exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs)**: Investors can set up a DRIP with these ETFs, which can help supercharge long-term gains by automatically reinvesting dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Efficiency**: Holding dividend ETFs in registered accounts like an RSP or TFSA can provide [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax-efficient investment strategies in Canada]] by shielding high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## General Cons of Canadian Dividend ETFs

Despite their popularity, Canadian dividend ETFs have several notable downsides:

*   **[[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | Higher Fees]]**: Dividend ETFs often have higher-than-average Management Expense Ratios (MERs) compared to broader market ETFs, which can significantly eat into returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. For example, XDV charges 0.55% MER for only 31 stocks, which is considered high for the level of diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
*   **Limited Diversification**: Most Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in just a few sectors, primarily financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For instance, VDY has over 85% exposure to these two sectors, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Additionally, some only hold a small number of stocks (e.g., XDV with 31 stocks, XD with 20 stocks), which does not provide broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control**: Investing in an ETF means less control over individual stock selections compared to building your own portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Capped Growth Potential**: Strategies like covered calls (e.g., ZWC) enhance income but significantly limit potential gains from stock price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## [[alternatives_to_canadian_dividend_etfs_for_investors | Alternatives to Canadian Dividend ETFs for Investors]]

Considering the downsides, investors might explore [[investment_strategies_using_dividend_etfs_in_canada | alternative investment strategies using dividend ETFs in Canada]]:

*   **Globally Diversified ETFs**: For true diversification, ETFs like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) hold over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies, which Canadian dividend ETFs often lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Information on [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | All-in-One ETFs in Canada]] is available in other resources.
*   **US Dividend Stocks**: Many of the best dividend stocks are in the US market, offering potentially higher dividend growth rates, more sector diversification, and global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Pro Tip**: Consider holding US dividend stocks in an RSP, not a TFSA, to avoid [[tax_implications_of_noncanadian_stocks_in_tfsa | withholding tax on the dividends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Building Your Own Portfolio**: Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might consider investing directly in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Approach**: A strategy could involve buying a Canadian dividend ETF and investing separately in some US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

While Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool, their higher fees, lack of diversification, and limited control are real concerns for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

The year 2025 brings significant [[capital_gains_tax_updates_for_canadian_business_owners_in_2025 | tax changes]] in Canada, particularly concerning capital gains. Understanding these updates can help individuals and businesses maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Investment and Real Estate Changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

### Capital Gains Inclusion Rate Adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

This is one of the most substantial [[capital_gains_tax_updates_for_canadian_business_owners_in_2025 | changes]] for 2025, requiring careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

#### For Individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   **First $250,000:** The first $250,000 of net capital gains in a year is taxed similar to before, with 50% of the gains being taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Over $250,000:** Any net capital gains exceeding $250,000 in the same year have a higher inclusion rate, with 66.67% (or 2/3) of those gains becoming taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

**Example for Individuals:**
Jason made $300,000 in net capital gains in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The first $250,000 is taxed at the usual 50% rate, adding $125,000 to his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   The remaining $50,000 ($300,000 - $250,000) is taxed at the new higher 66.67% inclusion rate, adding approximately $33,333 to his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   In total, Jason would have about $158,000 added to his taxable income from these capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Most Canadians with less than $250,000 in annual capital gains will not be affected by the increased rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, these [[tax_changes_affecting_business_owners | changes]] are primarily aimed at individuals with substantial capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

**Impact on Estate Planning:**
The new capital gains rules will significantly affect estate planning, making it more critical to [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_amidst_tax_changes | shield]] estates from these taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Tax Changes Affecting Business Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>

The [[tax_changes_affecting_business_owners | tax structure]] for capital gains for corporations has also been revised, which will be much more impactful for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

#### For Corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>
*   **Previous Rate:** Previously, 50% of a corporation's capital gains were included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **New Rate:** Under the new rules, this inclusion rate has increased to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Threshold:** Unlike individuals, this new capital gains inclusion rate for corporations starts at $1, not $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This requires more careful planning for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

**Example for Corporations:**
ABC Corp realizes a capital gain of $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   With the new inclusion rate, two-thirds of the gain (approximately $133,000) is added to the corporation's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>

The [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase_in_2025 | LCGE]] allows individuals to exclude a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   As of 2025, the LCGE limit has increased significantly to $1.25 million, up from $1.01 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

**Example:**
If you sell a qualified small business for $1.2 million, all the capital gains could be exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip:** The LCGE applies to each individual shareholder, meaning multiple shareholders can potentially claim the exemption on their respective gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>

The CEI aims to support entrepreneurs by reducing the capital gains inclusion rate to 1/3 on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   The incentive is being phased in, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching $2 million by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

**Example:**
A small business owner selling their enterprise with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would include only one-third of that in their taxable income under the CEI, compared to two-thirds without the incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This can result in significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

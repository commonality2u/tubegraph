When [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | planning to leave Canada permanently]], understanding how your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits are affected is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The CPP is based on contributions made during your working life in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## How Your CPP Benefits Are Affected

Your CPP benefits will continue to be paid to you if you move abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The amount you receive abroad will remain the exact same as if you were living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Tax Implications

[[tax_implications_of_cpp_benefits | CPP payments]] may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on the tax treaty status of your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **With Tax Treaty**: If you move to a country like the United States, which has a tax treaty with Canada, the treaty can reduce or even eliminate the withholding tax on your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Without Tax Treaty**: Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Understanding Implications**: It's crucial to understand these tax implications in your new country to avoid any surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Social Security Agreements

Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. These agreements are designed to ensure your CPP coverage continues uninterrupted and to avoid dual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They also coordinate pension benefits for individuals who have lived and worked abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A full list of these countries is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Other CPP Benefits

CPP survivor benefits and child benefits will continue to be paid even if the recipient lives abroad, ensuring your family benefits are secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Receiving Payments Abroad

You have several options for receiving your CPP payments while abroad:
*   **Local Bank Account**: Payments can be deposited directly into a local bank account in the local currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Canadian Bank Account**: Payments can be deposited into a Canadian bank account, which you can then transfer to your new bank using services like Wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Mailed Checks**: Payments can also be mailed as checks in Canadian dollars, though this is generally not the most convenient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

While mutual funds are a significant investment vehicle in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024, they present several hidden downsides that make exploring alternatives beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article will outline why traditional mutual funds may not be the best choice and explore smarter alternatives for Canadian investors.

## Understanding Mutual Funds

When discussing mutual funds, the focus is typically on the high-cost, actively managed ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. These funds pool money from numerous investors to acquire a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Professional portfolio managers or teams oversee these funds, making strategic buying and selling decisions with the aim of outperforming a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian mutual funds frequently fall short of this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Why Reconsider Mutual Funds?

Several key issues contribute to mutual funds being a less-than-ideal investment choice for many Canadians:

### [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | High Fees]]

[[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | Mutual fund fees]] in Canada are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. According to Morningstar's 2022 report, the average asset-weighted management expense ratio (MER) for equity funds in Canada is around 1.76%, for allocation funds it's about 1.9%, and for fixed income funds it's 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Many equity fund MERs from major banks like TD Bank can exceed 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

This seemingly small percentage can drastically reduce investment returns over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, a $100,000 investment growing at an average annual return of 7% would reach $387,000 over 20 years without fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, with a 2% annual fee, the actual return drops to 5%, leading to just $265,000 over the same period—a difference of $122,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Over 30 years, the impact is even more significant: $100,000 could grow to $761,000 without fees, but only $432,000 with a 2% fee, representing a staggering difference of $329,000, or 43% of potential returns lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This demonstrates how compounding interest magnifies the impact of fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | Low Returns]]

A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform their benchmarks]] across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The index gained an annualized return of 7.62%, while Canadian Equity Funds averaged only 5.64% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This difference is almost exactly the 2% in fees charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This underperformance isn't limited to one category:
*   98% of Canadian-focused Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   88.6% of Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   76.19% of Canadian small to mid-cap equity funds underperformed over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This consistent [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] across categories highlights a systemic issue within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Tricky Marketing Tactics

Banks and financial institutions often use selective reporting to market mutual funds, highlighting only top-performing funds and ignoring those that underperformed, were closed, or merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

This marketing strategy leverages survivorship bias, where only funds that "survived" (i.e., were not merged or liquidated due to poor performance) are included in performance reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. On average, across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. For Canadian Equity Funds, only 57.3% survived, and for Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### [[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | Tax Inefficiency Concerns]]

[[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | Tax inefficiencies]] can significantly impact returns, especially when holding mutual funds in a non-registered taxable account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>:

*   **Capital Gains Distributions:** Mutual funds annually distribute any realized capital gains to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This means investors can owe taxes on gains even if they haven't sold any shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading:** Actively managed funds often trade frequently, leading to numerous short-term capital gains, which are taxed at a higher rate (regular income tax rate) than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing:** Investors have no control over when fund managers realize gains or losses, potentially leading to taxable events at inopportune times that increase tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

To avoid [[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]], consider investing within a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Aggressive Distribution Channels

Mutual funds remain popular in Canada largely due to their ease of access and convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Banks and financial advisors aggressively push these high-profit products due to sales targets, leading many Canadians to invest in them over more cost-effective alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Investors are often drawn to the idea of professional portfolio management, trusting "experts" to achieve high returns, despite data suggesting otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Marketing, such as Morningstar's five-star ratings, can further mislead investors, even though studies show these funds often underperform in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Smart Alternatives to Mutual Funds

For Canadian investors looking to avoid the pitfalls of traditional mutual funds, several viable alternatives offer lower fees, better performance potential, and greater control. These [[selecting_the_right_investment_accounts_in_canada | alternatives]] are presented from easiest to most hands-on:

### 1. Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors provide a convenient and cost-effective way to invest, typically charging lower fees than traditional mutual funds—often about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Companies like Questwealth and Wealthsimple are popular choices in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Portfolio Manager

Engaging a portfolio manager can be more cost-effective than investing in mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. These professionals create personalized investment strategies tailored to individual financial goals and risk tolerance, offering expert management at typically lower fees than mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### 3. Building Your Own ETF Portfolios

The trend in Canada is shifting towards Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) over mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. In May 2024, mutual funds experienced net redemptions of $1.8 billion, while ETFs saw net sales of $4.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Building your own [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | ETF portfolio]] offers greater flexibility, significantly lower fees, and better tax efficiency compared to mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### 4. Creating a Do-It-Yourself Stock Portfolio

For those willing to commit time and effort, creating a do-it-yourself stock portfolio is the most hands-on and potentially rewarding alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This approach provides direct control over investments, minimizes fees, and allows for a portfolio perfectly tailored to specific preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. However, it requires significant knowledge, research, and time commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

While mutual funds remain popular in Canada, their [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]], consistent [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]], misleading marketing, and [[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]] can severely impact long-term returns and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Exploring alternatives such as robo-advisors, portfolio managers, building your own ETF portfolio, or a DIY stock portfolio can lead to more cost-effective and potentially more profitable investment outcomes. Investors should consider these options to make the most of their investments and achieve their [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | financial goals]].

While mutual funds are widely adopted in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024, they present several downsides, including [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] and persistent underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Actively managed mutual funds, which pool investor money to buy a diverse portfolio of securities, are overseen by professional managers aiming to outperform benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:47">[00:48:47]</a>. However, Canadian mutual funds frequently fall short of this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

## Why Canadian Mutual Funds Fall Short

*   **High Fees:** Canadian mutual fund fees are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. The average asset-weighted management expense ratio (MER) for equity funds is around 1.76%, for allocation funds about 1.9%, and for fixed-income funds 0.89% (Morningstar's 2022 report) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. A 2% fee can significantly reduce long-term returns; for example, $100,000 invested over 30 years with a 7% return (without fees) would grow to $761,000, but with a 2% fee (5% actual return), it would only reach $432,000â€”a difference of $329,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:97">[02:44:97]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **[[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | Low Returns]]**: A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada underperform their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. While the index gained an annualized return of 7.62%, Canadian Equity Funds averaged only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. This difference is nearly equivalent to the 2% fees charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Tricky Marketing Tactics**: Banks and financial institutions often use selective reporting, highlighting only top-performing funds and omitting underperforming ones that were closed or merged, creating an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. This is known as survivorship bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Over a recent 10-year period (as of 2023), 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated, and on average, 39% of funds across all categories disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
*   **[[tax_efficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | Tax Inefficiency]] Concerns**: Mutual funds can be tax inefficient, especially in non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Capital Gains Distribution**: Funds must distribute realized capital gains to investors annually, meaning investors may pay taxes on gains without directly benefiting from a sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
    *   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed funds often trade frequently, leading to short-term capital gains taxed at higher rates than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing**: Investors are subject to the fund manager's decisions on realizing gains or losses, potentially leading to taxable events at inconvenient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Investing in a [[investment_options_for_tfsa | TFSA]] can mitigate these tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Distribution Channels**: Mutual funds are highly accessible and convenient, often pushed by banks and financial advisors due to aggressive sales targets, as they are high-profit products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

## Viable Alternatives to Mutual Funds in Canada

Considering the drawbacks of mutual funds, Canadian investors have several smarter alternatives:

### 1. Robo Advisors

Robo advisors offer a convenient and cost-effective investment solution, typically charging lower fees (about half) than traditional mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:41">[12:20:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:15">[12:22:15]</a>. Popular options include Questwealth (known for lower fees) and Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:43">[12:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

### 2. Hiring a Portfolio Manager

Engaging a portfolio manager can be more cost-effective than investing in mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>. These professionals create personalized investment strategies aligned with an investor's financial goals and risk tolerance, providing expert management at lower fees than mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

### 3. Building Your Own ETF Portfolios

The trend is shifting towards Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) over mutual funds, with ETFs seeing significant net sales compared to mutual fund redemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Building your own ETF portfolio offers greater flexibility, lower fees, and better [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax efficiency]] compared to mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>.

### 4. Do-It-Yourself Stock Portfolio

For those willing to commit time and effort, creating a do-it-yourself stock portfolio is the most hands-on and potentially rewarding option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. This approach allows direct control over investments, minimizes fees, and enables a tailored portfolio to specific preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. However, it demands significant knowledge, research, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>.

| Alternative                 | Key Benefits                                     | Effort/Knowledge Required |
| :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Robo Advisors               | Convenient, Cost-effective, Lower fees           | Easiest                   |
| Hiring a Portfolio Manager  | Personalized strategy, Professional expertise, Lower fees than MFs | Medium                    |
| Building Own ETF Portfolios | Flexible, Lower fees, Better tax efficiency      | Medium                    |
| DIY Stock Portfolio         | Direct control, Minimal fees, Tailored           | Most difficult            |

Considering these alternatives and conducting further research can help investors make more informed decisions to maximize their returns and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

The average Canadian's RRSP balance decreased by over $30,000 between 2022 and 2023, dropping to $113,000 in 2023 from approximately $144,000 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This 28% decline in average RRSP account values brings balances closer to historical averages, suggesting that the elevated levels seen in 2021 and 2022 were likely temporary spikes due to pandemic-related savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Despite the recent decline, Canadians continue to prioritize their financial futures, though rising costs of living and inflation are making it harder to maintain high contribution levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

## Analyzing RRSP Holdings by Age: Median vs. Average

When examining RRSP data by age, median figures provide a more realistic snapshot than averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>. Averages can be skewed by high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>. The median data for this analysis, sourced from Stats Canada's 2019 information, combines RRSPs, RRIFs, and LRAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>.

### Young Canadians (Under 35)

Canadians under 35 have a median RRSP saving of just $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:18">[02:27:18]</a>. This highlights that many young adults have minimal retirement savings, making it crucial for them to begin saving consistently as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.

### Midlife Savers (35 to 54)

For those aged 35 to 54, savings improve, but the median of $30,000 to $70,000 is still considered far below what is typically needed for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>. Many individuals in this group are balancing mortgages, family expenses, and careers, which can make prioritizing retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:47">[03:01:47]</a>.

### Nearing Retirement (55 to 64)

Individuals aged 55 to 64 see their median savings grow to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:04">[03:14:04]</a>. While some are in better financial shape with an average of over $216,000, this median amount is often insufficient to sustain retirement comfortably, potentially requiring reliance on additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.

### Retirees (65 Plus)

For the 65-plus age group, the median savings remains at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:14">[03:33:14]</a>. This indicates that many retirees will heavily depend on government benefits like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security), as private savings may not cover all their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:11">[03:37:11]</a>.

## Factors Influencing RRSP Savings

### Household Size

Larger households tend to contribute more to their RRSPs, likely due to higher combined incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:28">[05:35:28]</a>. Two-person households, for example, show a median contribution of $4,888, whereas single-person households contribute significantly less, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:11">[05:46:11]</a>. This pattern suggests that dual-income households are often better positioned to prioritize and grow their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:14">[05:58:14]</a>.

### Economic Challenges

Economic challenges such as inflation and rising interest rates significantly impact Canadians' ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:21">[07:39:21]</a>. In 2023, 74% of Canadians were concerned about how inflation and rising prices affected their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:14">[07:53:14]</a>. By 2024, 63% still reported that current economic conditions negatively affected their ability to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:14">[08:04:14]</a>.

## RRSP Contributions by Age

Despite economic uncertainties, Canadians are prioritizing their RRSP contributions. The average contribution increased to $6,651 in 2023, up from $5,755 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:53">[06:40:53]</a>. Contributions vary by age group:
*   **55 and Above**: This group contributes a median of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:42">[07:01:42]</a>.
*   **15 to 24**: Younger Canadians contribute a median of $2,080, reflecting their earlier stage in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:17">[07:06:17]</a>.

The data indicates a clear focus on long-term financial security, with contributions growing as Canadians approach retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:26">[07:24:26]</a>.

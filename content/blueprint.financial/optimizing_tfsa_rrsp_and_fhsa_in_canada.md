From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Many individuals may not be fully optimizing their [[maximizing_tfsa_contributions_for_taxfree_growth | TFSA]], RRSP, and FHSA accounts, which could lead to significant financial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide aims to outline which accounts to prioritize to avoid common pitfalls and unlock potential government grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Prioritizing the "Big Three": FHSA, RRSP, or TFSA?

Choosing between the First Home Savings Account (FHSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), and Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

If you are saving for your first home, the FHSA is an excellent starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
It combines the benefits of both an RRSP and a TFSA:
*   **Tax-deductible contributions** like an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Tax-free withdrawals** like a TFSA, provided it's for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Even if homeownership isn't in your immediate future, the FHSA can still be a smart option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. You can invest within the account and let your money grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. If plans change, funds can be easily transferred to your RRSP, offering flexibility for various financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Pro-Tip: Income Splitting with FHSA
A higher-income spouse can gift up to $8,000 annually to a lower-income spouse, who can then contribute it to their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The growth on these funds remains tax-free, and the lower-income spouse receives a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### When to Hesitate with FHSA
The main reason to consider [[maximizing_the_benefits_of_your_tfsa | maxing out your TFSA]] before your FHSA is the need for flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. If you withdraw from an FHSA for a non-qualifying purpose (e.g., buying a car), you permanently lose that contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. For emergency funds, a TFSA is generally preferred over an FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## TFSA vs. RRSP: Which to Prioritize?

Choosing between a [[comparison_between_tfsa_and_rrsp | TFSA and an RRSP]] depends on your income, financial goals, and need for flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)
The [[maximizing_the_benefits_of_your_tfsa | TFSA is known for its flexibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. You can withdraw funds tax-free at any time, making it suitable for both short-term goals and long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Its simplicity means no complex withdrawal rules or tax implications, as long as contribution limits are respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You can contribute, withdraw, and recontribute the next year within your room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

**Prioritize TFSA when:**
*   You need easy access to your funds without penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   You are saving for short-term goals like vacations, big purchases, or emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   You are in a lower income year, where RRSP tax deductions would offer less benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   You seek a simple way to grow investments tax-free without locking in funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)
The RRSP is designed for long-term retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. It provides tax deductions upfront, and investments grow tax-free until retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It's particularly beneficial for higher-income earners or those with employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

**Prioritize RRSP when:**
*   You have a higher income and need tax deductions to reduce your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Your employer offers RRSP matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   You can use RRSP contributions to qualify for government benefits, such as the Canada Child Benefit or GST/HST credits, by controlling your income in key years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### General Guidance
It's often recommended to prioritize the FHSA first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. After that, choose between the [[using_tfsa_wisely_with_rrsp | TFSA or RRSP]] based on your specific situation, defaulting to the [[using_tfsa_and_rrsp_together_for_tax_savings | TFSA when in doubt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Three Important Exceptions: "Free Money" Accounts

There are three accounts that should be prioritized even before the FHSA, TFSA, or RRSP, due to the "free money" they offer through government grants or employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 1. Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP)
The RDSP offers significant support for Canadians with disabilities, providing substantial government grants and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Canada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG)**: Matches 300% on the first $500 contributed and 200% on the next $1,000, allowing for up to $3,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Canada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB)**: Provides up to $1,000 annually without requiring any personal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A $1,500 contribution to an RDSP can yield up to $3,500 from the CDSG and $1,000 from the CDSB, totaling $4,500 in free government support annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### 2. Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)
RESPs help families save for post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)**: Matches 20% of contributions, up to $500 per year per child, with a lifetime maximum of $7,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This provides an automatic 20% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Contributing $2,500 annually yields a $500 grant from the CESG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Canada Learning Bond (CLB)**: Lower-income families can receive up to $2,000 without requiring contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 3. RRSP Employer Matching
If your employer offers RRSP matching, maximize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This is essentially free money and provides an instant return on your contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   *Example*: If an employer matches 50% of contributions up to $1,500, a $3,000 contribution yields an instant 50% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Non-Registered Accounts

After maximizing all available registered accounts, non-registered accounts become the final destination for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While they lack the tax advantages of registered accounts, careful asset selection can still help grow wealth wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### Ideal Assets for Non-Registered Accounts
To minimize taxes in non-registered accounts:
*   **Avoid interest income**, which is taxed at the highest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Focus on growth stocks with no dividends**, such as Shopify, Nvidia, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Capital gains from these are taxed at a lower rate and only when the assets are sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Canadian dividend stocks** benefit from the Canadian dividend tax credit, which helps lower taxes on eligible dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A $1,000 dividend is grossed up to $1,380, resulting in a 15% federal tax credit that reduces taxes by $207, with provincial credits offering further relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Assets to Avoid in Non-Registered Accounts
*   **US dividend-paying stocks** should generally be avoided in non-registered accounts, as they face withholding taxes and do not qualify for the Canadian dividend tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Final Order of Priority for Investing

Here is a recommended order of priority for contributing to various investment accounts, assuming you qualify for each:

1.  **RDSP (Registered Disability Savings Plan)**: Prioritize if you qualify, due to the generous government grants for disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
2.  **RRSP with Employer Matching**: Prioritize for the free employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
3.  **RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)**: Provides a 20% government match (up to $500 annually) for education savings, and can act as a form of income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
4.  **FHSA (First Home Savings Account)**: Best for first-time home buyers, offering tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
5.  **RRSP or TFSA**:
    *   **RRSP**: For higher income earners seeking immediate tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. [[situations_favoring_rrsp_over_fhsa | Situations favoring RRSP]] include higher income years.
    *   **TFSA**: For flexibility and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. [[coordinating_tfsa_with_rrsp_and_cpp | Coordinating TFSA with RRSP]] can be beneficial. [[balancing_rsp_and_tfsa_withdrawals_to_minimize_taxes | Balancing TFSA and RRSP withdrawals]] is key in retirement.
6.  **Non-Registered Accounts**: As a final step, focus on growth stocks or Canadian dividend stocks for tax efficiency, while avoiding US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Remember, the optimal account strategy depends on your individual financial goals, income, and savings needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Canadians may be able to deduct eligible medical expenses from their income to reduce their tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This is one of several [[lesserknown_canadian_tax_deductions | lesser known deductions]] that can lead to significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Eligibility Criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
To claim medical expenses, the costs must be incurred for:
*   Yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
*   Your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   Your dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

The expenses must have been paid within any 12-month period ending in the tax year and must not have been previously claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Ineligible Medical Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
Certain expenses are commonly, but incorrectly, thought to be eligible:
*   Over-the-counter medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   Health club memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   Non-prescription supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

## Claim Limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
For the 2024 tax year, you can only claim expenses exceeding the lesser of:
*   $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>
*   3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>

### Example Calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
Consider an individual with a net income of $60,000 who incurred $3,000 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   3% of $60,000 (net income) = $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
*   The fixed amount = $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>

The maximum amount that can be deducted is the lesser of these two figures, which is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

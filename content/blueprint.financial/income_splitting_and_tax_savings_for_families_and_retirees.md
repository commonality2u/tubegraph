Claiming available tax credits and understanding how to combine them is crucial for Canadians to maximize their tax savings and avoid leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Many credits are available, some automatically applied, while others require manual claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Tax Credits for Retirees

Several non-refundable tax credits are specifically designed to reduce taxes for seniors and those in retirement.

### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the age amount tax credit, a non-refundable credit aimed at reducing taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. However, this credit is gradually reduced if net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This tax break helps retirees retain more of their money while efficiently managing taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Pension Income Amount
Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### [[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | Pension Income Splitting]]
Any unused portion of the pension income amount can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. [[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | Pension income splitting]] allows couples to allocate eligible pension income between them for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This strategy can lead to even greater savings by shifting income into a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### Home Accessibility Expenses
Seniors and persons with disabilities can claim up to $20,000 in home renovation expenses that improve accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Eligible expenses include installing ramps, grab bars, walk-in tubs, or lowering cabinets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This credit can reduce taxes by up to $3,000 (15% of $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. It can also be combined with the Medical Expenses Tax Credit for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## Tax Credits for Families and Dependents

Several tax credits offer relief to families supporting children or other dependents, as well as those managing health or education costs.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)
The CCA provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim $8,061 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. For a child under 18 with a disability, the credit amount is $2,861 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income, and eligibility varies, with additional amounts potentially claimed for spouses or common-law partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Medical documentation may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

### Medical Expenses Tax Credit
This credit helps Canadians offset out-of-pocket healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. You can claim eligible medical expenses that exceed 3% of your net income or $2,834 (whichever is lower for 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Eligible expenses include prescriptions, dental care, vision care, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, other medical treatments, and medical travel expenses if care isn't available locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. To maximize the claim, combine expenses for yourself, your spouse, and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)
The CWB is a refundable tax credit designed to support low-income workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. For 2025, eligible individuals can receive up to $1,633 for single people with no children or up to $2,813 for families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The benefit begins to phase out at $26,845 for singles and $36,639 for families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Advanced payments are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

### Tuition Tax Credit
Students can reduce their income taxes by claiming eligible tuition fees paid to a post-secondary institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. To qualify, at least $100 in tuition fees must have been paid to a recognized educational institution in Canada or abroad, and courses must be at a post-secondary level or improve occupational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. For students 16 and older, online courses may qualify if they meet full-time attendance requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Unused credit can be carried forward to a future tax year or transferred up to $5,000 to a parent, grandparent, spouse, or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

### Canada Child Benefit (CCB)
The CCB provides tax-free monthly payments to help families with the cost of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. In 2025, parents can receive up to $7,997 per child under six and $6,745 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The benefit is income-tested, meaning payments phase out as family income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Once applied for and deemed eligible, payments are automatically issued without the need for annual claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Disability Amount (DTC)
Individuals with severe, prolonged disabilities may qualify for the Disability Tax Credit (DTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. The 2025 federal disability amount is $9,138, reducing taxes owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse, common-law partner, or supporting relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Application for this non-refundable tax credit requires Form T2201 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

### Amount for an Eligible Dependent
A single parent or individual supporting a dependent relative may claim a non-refundable tax credit of up to $1,129 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. To qualify, the dependent must have lived with you in a home you maintained, and their net income must be below the set threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. If eligible for the Canada Caregiver Amount, a higher credit may be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Child Care Expenses Deduction
This deduction allows families to claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

## Maximizing Tax Savings by Stacking Credits

The key to maximizing savings is understanding how to combine multiple tax credits and deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Saving Combo
This combo helps retirees keep more of their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Example: John and Linda (Retirees)
> John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income. Both are over 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
> 1.  **Pension Income Amount:** Both John and Linda can claim the pension income amount (up to $2,000 per person) to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This is worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
> 2.  **Age Amount Credit:** John also qualifies for the age amount credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.
> 3.  **[[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | Pension Income Splitting]]:** A bonus tip is that [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | pension income splitting]] can save them even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
>
> **Stack Savings:** Pension Income Amount + Age Amount + [[income_splitting_strategies to reduce taxes | Pension Income Splitting]] = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Example: Sarah and Mike (Families with Kids)
> Sarah and Mike have two young children; their children are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
> 1.  **Canada Child Benefits (CCB):** They receive tax-free monthly payments to help with child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
> 2.  **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
> 3.  **Canada Caregiver Amount:** Since one child has a disability, they receive an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
> 4.  **[[income_splitting_with_rrsps | Income Splitting with RRSPs]]:** As a bonus tip, families can also [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | split income]] by contributing to a spouse's RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
>
> **Stack Savings:** CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit + [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | Income Splitting with RRSPs]] = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

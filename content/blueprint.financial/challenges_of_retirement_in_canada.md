Retirement, ideally a time for relaxation, has become a growing [[challenges_of_retiring_on_cpp_and_oas_alone | financial crisis]] for many Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Retiree incomes are declining while inflation is on the rise, leaving many wondering if they will have enough to get by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down the real numbers behind retiree incomes in Canada and explores the challenges of achieving a comfortable retirement on an average income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Reality of Retiree Income in Canada

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, for Canadians aged 65 and older, the median after-tax income was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:
*   **For couples**: $74,200 per year, or $6,183 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **For single seniors**: $30,820 per year, which is only $2,568 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

For context, the median income across all age groups in Canada is approximately $95,000 for couples and $33,000 for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This highlights that many retirees are living on significantly less than the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. With rising [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | costs]], particularly for housing, food, and healthcare, the purchasing power of these incomes is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Surging Inflation and Decreasing Purchasing Power

Retirement income isn't just stagnating; it's actively losing purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Between 2020 and 2022, senior couples saw their median after-tax income drop from $76,860 to $74,200, a 1.4% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Single retirees experienced a decrease from $32,720 to $30,820, a 1.2% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Concurrently, inflation surged by about 10% during the same period (2020-2022), increasing the cost of essential goods like groceries, gas, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Even if incomes appear somewhat stable, inflation acts like a silent tax, chipping away at financial security and eroding purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Reasons for Declining Retirement Incomes

Several factors contribute to the drop in average retirement incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>:

*   **Weaker Pensions**: Fewer employers offer guaranteed pensions today, shifting financial risk onto retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Savings Shortfalls**: Wages have not kept pace with inflation, making it harder for individuals to accumulate sufficient savings for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Years of Low Interest Rates**: Before recent increases, bonds and savings accounts, traditionally reliable income sources, offered minimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This often forced retirees to take on more investment risk or withdraw more than initially planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Longer Retirements**: Canadians are living longer, meaning their savings need to last for decades, placing more pressure on their retirement funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

These factors underscore why smart [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | planning]] is crucial for protecting retirement savings and navigating these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Comparing Retiree Incomes: Couples vs. Singles

Not all retirees face the same financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   A senior couple earning above $74,200 per year is in the top 50% of retiree households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   For single seniors, earning above $30,820 per year places them in the upper half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

A significant challenge is that single retirees often face a much tougher financial situation than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While their overall needs may be less, their costs do not scale down proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Single individuals may spend 60% to 80% of what a household spends, but often have 50% or less of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Key expenses that don't significantly decrease for single retirees include:
*   **Housing Costs**: Rent or home maintenance costs are often the same whether single or part of a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Food and Utilities**: While couples can share grocery and utility bills, a single retiree covers everything independently <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Expenses**: Certain medical and insurance costs are fixed regardless of household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> For single retirees, [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | financial planning]] is even more crucial to strategically stretch income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Why Many Seniors Keep Working

Retirement does not always mean leaving the workforce entirely. A surprising number of seniors continue working into their later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In 2022, over 1.9 million Canadians aged 65 and older reported employment income, contributing a combined $58.8 billion in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Reasons for seniors continuing to work include:
*   **Financial Necessity**: Many retirees simply lack sufficient savings to cover all their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Inflation Pressure**: Rising [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | costs]] make it difficult to rely solely on pensions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Personal Fulfillment**: Some retirees enjoy staying active in the workforce through part-time jobs, consulting, or starting small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While working can supplement income, it's not the only strategy. Smart [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | planning]] can help retirees create a sustainable financial future without prolonged employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## The Importance of Financial Planning

A comprehensive [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | financial plan]] is essential for navigating the complexities of retirement. It typically involves multiple meetings, analyzing finances, understanding goals, and crafting a personalized strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Case Study: John Doe's Retirement Scenario

A quick planning session with a hypothetical client, John Doe (aged 65), illustrates common challenges and solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

**John's Initial Situation**:
*   **Income**: $30,000 per year (around the Canadian average for single seniors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Desired Spending**: $65,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Assets**:
    *   $400,000 in RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
    *   $75,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
    *   $50,000 in non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   **Concerns**: Running out of money and wishing to leave an inheritance for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Current Investments**: 60% equity/40% fixed income in RRSP/TFSA, 20% equity/80% cash in non-registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Assumptions**: Conservative return estimates (5.4% equity, 3.4% fixed income, 2.4% cash) and 2.1% annual inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

**Initial Assessment Challenges**:
*   Due to inflation, $65,000 in spending at age 65 would require $88,000 by age 80 to maintain the same lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   At his current rate, John would run out of money around age 78 or 79, with only his principal residence remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   To sustain his desired lifestyle until age 95, he would need to borrow $1.58 million, which would likely exceed his house value and result in a negative estate, failing both his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> It's crucial to find out if your retirement goals are unrealistic sooner rather than later, before you're 75 and potentially running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### Recommended Solutions for John Doe

A financial planner proposed the following strategies to address John's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>:
1.  **Downgrade Housing**: Sell his $800,000 house for a $600,000 house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  **Delay Retirement**: Work until age 70, which allows him to delay OAS and CPP benefits, increasing their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
3.  **Increase Savings**: Save an additional $1,000 per year into his TFSA and $2,000 per year into his RRSP for the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Investment Strategy**: Increase asset allocation to equity, becoming more aggressive due to a longer investment time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Spending**: Reduce desired spending to $60,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

**Outcome with Recommendations**:
With these adjustments, John's plan became sustainable. He would be able to live until age 95, have manageable debt lower than his house value, and successfully leave assets to his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

This example illustrates how a well-structured [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | financial plan]] can reduce uncertainty, provide options, and help retirees feel more secure about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. For individuals relying solely on average income with no assets or home ownership, [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | financial planning]] becomes even more critical, and starting early provides more control over one's financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Retirement is too important to leave to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

One strategy to minimize the tax burden on your [[RRSP withdrawal planning in retirement | Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)]] upon death is to convert it to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) and begin making structured, early withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. This proactive approach helps manage your taxable income over many years, potentially keeping you in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>

Instead of holding onto your RRSP until death, which risks a significant tax hit, you can convert it to a RRIF once you retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The RRIF allows you to control the amount you withdraw annually, spreading the income over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This method helps to:
*   Keep your taxable income in a lower bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   Reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

### Example: David's RRIF Withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>

Consider David, who retires at 65 with $600,000 in his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Rather than waiting to withdraw, he converts his RRSP to a RRIF and begins withdrawing $40,000 each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This $40,000 adds to his annual income but keeps him in a manageable tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

If David had delayed withdrawals, his RRSP could have grown substantially, likely pushing his estate into the top tax bracket of 53% upon his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. By withdrawing gradually through his RRIF, he minimizes taxes year after year and maintains more effective control over his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

### Pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>

*   **Smooths out tax bill** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>: Spreading withdrawals over several years avoids a large lump-sum tax hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Better tax planning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>: Gives you control over annual withdrawal amounts, allowing for strategic tax management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### Cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>

*   **Taxes still apply** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>: Withdrawals are still taxable, even if in smaller amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
*   **Requires careful planning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>: It's crucial to avoid withdrawing too much, which could push you into a higher tax bracket or deplete your RRSP too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Despite concerns among 64% of Canadians that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) may not be available when they retire, the fund's investment performance demonstrates significant security and resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This confidence is supported by strong investment returns, robust long-term projections, and a transparent management structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Outperforming Expectations

The CPP fund has consistently outperformed initial expectations, leading to a much larger asset base than projected decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Year 2024 Performance:** For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion, achieving an 8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Asset Growth:** This strong performance pushed the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Exceeding Projections:** In 2000, the CPP was projected to reach $425 billion by 2023; however, it actually reached $632 billion in 2023, exceeding projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This outperformance highlights the effectiveness of sound investment strategies by fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** The fund has shown resilience, continuing to grow even through challenging economic periods such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This growth ensures the CPP's capacity to manage the increasing number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## [[longterm_sustainability_of_the_cpp_fund | Sustainability for Generations]]

The [[longterm_sustainability_of_the_cpp_fund | long-term sustainability of the CPP fund]] is regularly assessed by the chief actuary of Canada, with the latest report confirming its solid financial footing for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **Current Assets:** The CPP fund currently holds $632 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **[[future_growth_projections_of_cpp | Projected Growth]]:**
    *   By 2030, assets are expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   By 2040, assets are projected to nearly double again to $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   By 2050, the fund is expected to reach an estimated $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

These projections demonstrate the fund's capacity to support both current retirees and future generations, remaining financially stable into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting

The reliability of CPP's financial reports is ensured by multiple layers of independent oversight:

*   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** This independent body provides impartial assessments of the CPP's financial health, ensuring reports are accurate and free from political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 31st [[actuarial_studies_and_reports_on_cpp | Actuarial Report]] completed in 2022 affirmed the CPP's sustainability for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** The PBO provides an additional layer of independent scrutiny, known for its transparent, nonpartisan, and objective analysis of financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** External firms, such as Deloitte, conduct audits to confirm the integrity of financial reporting. Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

This multi-faceted oversight system establishes the CPP as one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available, providing peace of mind for Canadians regarding their [[retirement_strategies_integrating_cpp | retirement benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Investment Performance and Management Strategies

The success of the CPP fund is largely attributed to the performance and management strategies employed by CPP Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

*   **Strong Long-Term Returns:** CPP Investments has delivered a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This consistent outperformance reflects the success of its investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Diversified Global Portfolio:** The fund maintains a globally diversified portfolio across 56 countries, investing in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, reducing reliance on a single economy and enhancing stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Active Management Strategy:** CPP Investments utilizes an active management approach, investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity to outperform passive strategies over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While this approach may lead to underperformance in specific years (e.g., an 8% net return in fiscal 2024 compared to a 19.9% reference portfolio return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>), it is considered essential for addressing the complexities of pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

The significant growth of CPP assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates that the investment management has been sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This robust financial position affirms the CPP's role as Canada's reliable retirement backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

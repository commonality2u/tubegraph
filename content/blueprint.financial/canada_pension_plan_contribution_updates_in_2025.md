Major changes to the [[Changes in pension systems in Canada | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] are set to impact business owners and self-employed individuals in 2025, primarily through increased contribution thresholds and rates. These [[Canada Pension Plan 2025 updates | updates]] will influence payroll costs and cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Contribution Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

The [[Canada Pension Plan 2025 updates | CPP enhancements]] maintain a two-level contribution structure:
*   **Regular CPP**: Up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **CPP2**: Up to the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Key Thresholds for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

For 2025, the thresholds are as follows:
*   **YMPE**: Increased to $71,500, up from $69,700 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **YAMPE**: Risen to $81,300, up from the 2024 amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Contribution Rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

### Regular CPP Contributions (Up to YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   **Employees**: 5.95% on income up to $71,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Employers**: Match the employee contribution (5.95%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Self-employed**: Pay both portions, totaling 11.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### CPP2 Contributions (Between YMPE and YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   Applied to income between $71,500 and $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Employees**: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Employers**: Match the employee contribution (4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Self-employed**: Pay both portions, totaling 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Example for Self-Employed Individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
Self-employed individuals must contribute both the employee and employer portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. For instance, a self-employed person earning over $81,300 in 2025 will contribute a total of $8,888 to their [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Impact and Purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

These [[Economic impact of increased CPP contributions | changes]] aim to improve [[Future of Canada Pension Plan CPP | retirement security]] by gradually increasing the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

However, the higher contribution rates mean increased costs for employers and self-employed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Businesses with multiple employees may experience a noticeable impact on payroll expenses and cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Small businesses may need to adjust budgets or explore tax-efficient compensation methods to manage the financial strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

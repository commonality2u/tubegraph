A common regret for Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) holders is underestimating the automatic withholding tax applied to withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Many assume they will only owe tax at filing time, but a portion of the withdrawal is deducted upfront, resulting in less immediate cash than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Understanding the Withholding Tax

The amount withheld depends on how much is being withdrawn early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. It's important to remember that this withholding tax is not necessarily the final amount of tax owed; it is an upfront deduction that may or may not cover the full tax liability, especially if the withdrawal pushes the individual into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Examples of Withholding Tax Impact

*   **Jeff's Emergency Expense:**
    *   Jeff withdraws $10,000 for an emergency expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   His bank withholds 20% ($2,000), meaning he only receives $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   When he files his taxes, his marginal tax rate is higher than 20%, so he has to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Maria's Vacation Withdrawal:**
    *   Maria, a retiree, withdraws $25,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   Her bank automatically withholds 30%, leaving her with $17,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   At tax time, her income rate is even higher than 30%, compelling her to pay another $2,500 beyond what was already deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Many individuals regret assuming that the withholding tax was the final amount owing, leading to an unpleasant surprise at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This makes early [[RRSP withdrawal planning in retirement | RRSP withdrawals]] less appealing than they might initially seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

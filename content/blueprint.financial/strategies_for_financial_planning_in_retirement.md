Retirement should be a period of relaxation, but for many Canadians, it is becoming a significant financial concern due to falling retiree incomes and rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Effective [[financial_planning for retirement | financial planning]] is crucial to navigate these challenges and ensure a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Reality of Retiree Income in Canada

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older was:
*   **Couples**: $74,200 per year ($6,183 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Single Seniors**: $30,820 per year ($2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

For context, the median income across all age groups in Canada is approximately $95,000 for couples and $33,000 for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This disparity highlights that many retirees live on significantly less than the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Impact of Surging Inflation

Retirement income isn't just stagnating; it's actively losing purchasing power due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Between 2020 and 2022, senior couples saw their median after-tax income drop by 1.4%, from $76,860 to $74,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Single retirees experienced a 1.2% decrease, from $32,720 to $30,820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   During the same period, inflation surged by about 10%, increasing the cost of essential goods like groceries, gas, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Inflation acts like a "silent tax," chipping away at financial security and eroding purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Why Average Retirement Incomes Are Dropping

Several factors contribute to the decline in average retirement incomes:
*   **Weaker Pensions**: Fewer employers offer guaranteed pensions, shifting financial risk to retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Savings Shortfalls**: Wages have not kept pace with inflation, making it harder for individuals to accumulate sufficient savings for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Years of Low Interest Rates**: Before recent increases, bonds and savings accounts, often reliable income sources, offered minimal returns, forcing retirees to take on more risk or withdraw more than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Longer Retirements**: Canadians are living longer, meaning their savings need to last for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## The Importance of [[financial_planning for retirement | Financial Planning for Retirement]]

Smart [[financial_planning for retirement | financial planning]] is vital for protecting retirement savings and navigating challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Proper planning helps minimize the risk of outliving one's savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Special Challenges for [[financial_planning for single retirees | Single Retirees]]

[[financial_planning for single retirees | Single retirees]] face a much tougher financial situation compared to couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While they may need less overall, their costs do not scale down proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   Single individuals often spend 60-80% of what a household spends but may only have 50% or less of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Housing Costs**: Rent or home maintenance costs are often the same whether single or part of a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Food and Utilities**: A single retiree covers all expenses on their own, unlike couples who can share and split bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Expenses**: Certain medical and insurance costs are fixed regardless of household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

For [[financial_planning for single retirees | single retirees]], [[financial_planning for retirement | financial planning]] is even more crucial to strategically stretch income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Budget in Phases**: Most retirees spend more in their first 10-15 years on activities like travel, hobbies, and home renovations. A retirement plan should account for this active phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Why Many Seniors Keep Working

A significant number of seniors continue working in their later years. In 2022, over 1.9 million Canadians aged 65 and older reported employment income, totaling $58.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Reasons for this include:
*   **Financial Necessity**: Insufficient savings to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Inflation Pressure**: Rising costs make it difficult to rely solely on pensions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Personal Fulfillment**: Many enjoy staying active through part-time jobs, consulting, or starting small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While working can supplement income, it's not the only strategy. Smart [[financial_planning for retirement | planning]] can create a sustainable financial future without relying on extended employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Real-Life Retirement Planning Scenario

A [[comprehensive_financial_planning for retirement | comprehensive financial planning for retirement]] process typically involves several meetings and detailed analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. A condensed example illustrates how planning can make an average retiree income work:

### Client Profile: John Doe
*   **Age**: 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Planned Retirement Income**: ~$30,000 (around the Canadian average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Desired Annual Spending**: $65,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Assets**:
    *   RRSP: $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   TFSA: $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Non-registered account: $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Concerns/Goals**: Not running out of money and leaving a legacy for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Current Investments**:
    *   RRSP/TFSA: 60% equity, 40% fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   Non-registered: 20% equity, 80% cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Initial Assessment (Conservative Estimates)
*   **Rates of Return**: 5.4% for equity, 3.4% for fixed income, 2.4% for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: 2.1% for spending increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

The initial assessment revealed that John's $65,000 annual spending would not be sustainable due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. By age 80, living the same lifestyle would require withdrawing about $88,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This would lead to John running out of money around age 78 or 79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, with the only remaining asset being his principal residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. If he were to live to age 95, the amount he would need to borrow to sustain his lifestyle ($1.58 million) would exceed his house value, resulting in a negative estate and failing both his goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Recommendations and Outcome
To achieve John's goals, the financial planner suggested the following [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | strategies for effective retirement planning]]:
1.  **Downgrade House**: Sell an $800,000 house for a $600,000 house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  **Delay Retirement**: Work until age 70, which allows delaying Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
3.  **Increase Savings**: Save an additional $1,000 per year into TFSA and $2,000 per year into RRSP over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Investments**: Be more aggressive with investments by increasing asset allocation to equity, given a longer time horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
5.  **Decrease Spending**: Reduce annual spending to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

After implementing these changes, the numbers indicated a sustainable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. John would still have some debt by age 95, but it would be lower than his house value, allowing him to live until age 95 and leave a significant amount of assets to his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This demonstrates how a well-structured plan can reduce uncertainty and provide options for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] If financial goals are unrealistic, it's better to find out and adjust them early on, rather than facing financial difficulties at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

This example assumes the person has assets to work with. If relying solely on average income without assets or home ownership, [[financial_planning for retirement | financial planning]] becomes even more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The [[importance_of_early_financial_planning_for_retirement | earlier you start financial planning for retirement]], the more control you will have over your financial future, making it easier to build security over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Retirement is too important to leave to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

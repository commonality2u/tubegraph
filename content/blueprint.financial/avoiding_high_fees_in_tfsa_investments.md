High fees are identified as one of the "silent wealth killers" that can significantly drain the potential of a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) without the holder realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Similar to termites silently damaging a wooden house, these hidden fees can substantially decrease TFSA wealth over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem with High Fees

High fees are described as one of the "sneakiest ways" to undermine TFSA potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Financial institutions can make it challenging for investors to discern the exact amount of fees paid annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Canada's High Mutual Fund Fees

Canada is known for having some of the highest mutual fund fees globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The average Management Expense Ratio (MER) for Canadian Equity Funds stands at 1.76%, according to a Morningstar report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Major banks, including TD, RBC, and CIBC, routinely offer funds with MERs exceeding 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

High fees are a significant factor in underperformance:
*   93.4% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmarks over a 10-year period, largely due to high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Closet Indexing

A "sinister" practice observed in many high-fee funds is "closet indexing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This occurs when funds charge high fees for supposedly active management but essentially mimic the index they claim to outperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

For example, a comparison between the RBC US Equity Fund and Vanguard's VFV, both using the S&P 500 as a benchmark, illustrates this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:
*   **RBC US Equity Fund**: Charges a 1.88% MER and claims active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Its performance closely mirrored the index fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Vanguard VFV**: A low-cost passive ETF with a 0.09% MER that tracks the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Over five years, the financial impact of these fee differences is substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>:
*   An initial $100,000 invested in **Vanguard VFV** (116% return) would grow to $216,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   The same $100,000 in the **RBC fund** (88% return) would only grow to $188,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   This represents a difference of $38,000 in just five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Compounded losses due to fees over 20 to 30 years could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For instance, a $4 billion RBC fund with nearly a 2% MER collects approximately $80 million annually in fees from Canadian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Thousands of similar high-fee funds in Canada siphon billions of dollars from TFSAs every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Strategies to Mitigate High Fees

*   **Avoid Mutual Funds**: Due to their notoriously high fees and underperformance, it is advisable to avoid mutual funds in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Seek Professional Guidance**: For those who find [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investments | managing their TFSA]] challenging due to lack of time, emotional decision-making, or insufficient knowledge, seeking professional financial advice can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Advisors can provide tailored guidance to optimize tax efficiency, align investments with long-term goals, and help [[investment_risk_management_in_tfsa_accounts | avoid emotional pitfalls]] like panic selling or chasing risky trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

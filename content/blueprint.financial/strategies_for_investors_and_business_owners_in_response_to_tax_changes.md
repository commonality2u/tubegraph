The Canadian Finance Minister announced a delay to the capital gains tax hike until January 1st, 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tax hike, which would raise the inclusion rate of capital gains from 50% to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, was initially introduced in June 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> but now faces significant legal and political challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Background on the Capital Gains Tax Hike

The capital gains tax increase aims to raise the inclusion rate from 50% to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This measure was introduced in June 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> but is now delayed until January 1st, 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> due to ongoing legal and political pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has publicly vowed to repeal the tax if elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, arguing that it negatively impacts investors, business owners, and retirees by hurting investments, slowing business growth, and diminishing Canada's global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Betting markets indicate a high likelihood of a Conservative victory, with odds suggesting approximately a 95% chance of Poilievre's party winning the next federal election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, which is set for October 20, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Further complicating the situation, US President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on Canadian imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, adding pressure to the Canadian economy and potentially making the capital gains tax hike less feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation is also challenging the government in court, contending that the CRA lacks legal authority to collect the higher tax because the legislation has not been officially passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. If the court sides with the Federation, the increase could be struck down before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Support within the Liberal Party is also declining, with former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland now stating she would scrap the change if she were to become Liberal leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Reasons For and Against Reversal

### Reasons Against Reversal
*   **Revenue Loss** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>: The tax was projected to generate about $17 billion over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, intended for housing, dental care, and pharmacare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Reversing it would require the government to find new revenue sources or cut spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Tax on the Wealthy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>: The Liberals presented this as a measure to make wealthier Canadians contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. A rollback could be perceived as beneficial to the top 1%, carrying political risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Reasons for Reversal
*   **Harm to Business Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>: Higher capital gains taxes can discourage investments, slow business exits, and limit reinvestment within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **US Tariff Threats** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>: New US tariffs could push businesses and investments towards the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, and an additional tax could exacerbate this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **High Business Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>: Canada already has high corporate tax rates, regulations, and labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This tax increase would add another burden, making it harder for companies to grow, sell, or reinvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios and Outcomes

The future of the capital gains tax depends on ongoing legal and political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. There are three possible outcomes:

### Best Case Scenario: Full Reversal
This could occur through a successful judicial review, where courts block the CRA from enforcing the higher inclusion rate, effectively reversing the tax hike before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Alternatively, if Pierre Poilievre wins the election and fulfills his promise, the inclusion rate would likely revert to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, benefiting investors, business owners, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Middle Ground Scenario: Partial Rollback or Temporary Freeze
If Poilievre is elected, he might lower the inclusion rate but not fully restore it to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, possibly applying different rules for corporations versus individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Similarly, a new Liberal leader might reduce the inclusion rate slightly without full restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Worst Case Scenario: No Reversal
This outcome would occur if legal challenges against the tax fail and the courts rule in favor of the government, allowing the CRA to continue collecting at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It could also happen if Poilievre wins but does not follow through on his promise due to economic pressures or competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, or if the Liberals surprisingly remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In this case, businesses and investors would need to adjust to the new tax reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

    <p>While a full reversal is considered highly likely, with an estimated 80% chance of occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, there's a 5% chance of a partial rollback and a 15% chance that the tax remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.</p>
</div>

## Recommended Actions for Investors and Business Owners

Given the high probability of reversal but the uncertainty of the situation, the best approach is to prepare for all scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

*   **Stay Informed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>: Keep abreast of court rulings, political developments, and election timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Any reversal will likely take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **[[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | Use Tax-Efficient Strategies]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>: Protect your wealth by maximizing the use of TFSAs, RRSPs, and corporate structures to reduce taxable capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Plan for Multiple Outcomes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>: If you are considering selling a business, other assets, or real estate, evaluate whether to sell now in case the tax proceeds in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Although the capital gains tax hike is on shaky ground due to court battles, political infighting, and the possibility of a Poilievre victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, nothing is guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Investors and business owners should plan strategically to protect their wealth in case the tax remains in effect longer than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

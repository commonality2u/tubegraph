[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting strategies]] are effective methods for retirees to reduce their overall tax burden, particularly when one spouse or common-law partner is in a higher tax bracket than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. These strategies help keep more money in retirement for various pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## CPP or QPP Pension Sharing

This strategy involves sharing Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### How it Works
Higher-income retirees can allocate a portion of their CPP payments to a lower-income spouse, which reduces the household's total tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Eligibility
Both spouses must be at least 60 years old, live together, and have made contributions to either CPP or QPP during their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Example
> [!EXAMPLE] Mark and Linda
> Mark receives $1,200 per month in CPP, totaling $14,400 annually, taxed at a 42% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. His spouse, Linda, has no CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
> By splitting 50% of his CPP with Linda, Mark's taxable income drops to $7,200 (taxed at 42%), and Linda's income also becomes $7,200 (taxed at 22%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
> This reduces their total tax bill from $6,048 to $4,752, resulting in a savings of almost $1,300 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Pension Income Splitting

[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] is another effective strategy for tax reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### How it Works
Retirees aged 65 and older can allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income, such as RIF payments or annuities, to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This allocation can be adjusted annually based on their tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Example
> [!EXAMPLE] Sarah and John
> Sarah receives $60,000 annually in RIF income, taxed at a 33% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Her spouse, John, earns $40,000 and is taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
> By allocating 50% of her RIF income ($30,000) to John, Sarah's taxable income is reduced, and they both benefit from John's lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
> This strategy saves them $3,900 annually by lowering their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It also helps prevent potential OAS clawbacks, allowing them to retain more retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Spousal RSP Contributions

[[income_splitting_and_spousal_retirement_savings | Spousal RSP contributions]] are effective for high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### How it Works
High-income earners can contribute to a spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), allowing income to be shifted to the lower-income spouse when they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This equalizes retirement withdrawals and reduces overall taxes for the household <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Example
> [!EXAMPLE] Emma and Liam
> Emma earns $120,000 per year and contributes $10,000 annually to a spousal RSP for her husband, Liam, who earns $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
> By the time they retire, Liam's spousal RSP has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. In retirement, Liam withdraws $20,000 per year from the spousal RSP, taxed at his lower rate of 15%, instead of Emma's higher rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
> This shift results in a tax savings of $3,000 annually, reducing their household tax burden and providing more income at a lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Considerations
*   Withdrawals are taxed in the lower-income spouse's hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Attribution Rule:** Contributions made within two years of withdrawals will be taxed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

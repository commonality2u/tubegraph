[[Introduction to income splitting strategies|Income splitting strategies]] can significantly help retirees reduce their overall tax burden, particularly when one spouse or common-law partner is in a higher tax bracket than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.

## Strategies Overview

### CPP/QPP Pension Sharing

Sharing Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits allows higher-income retirees to allocate a portion of their CPP payments to a lower-income spouse, thereby reducing the household's total tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

**Eligibility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
*   Both spouses must be at least 60 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   They must live together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   They must have made contributions to either CPP or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) during their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

**Example** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>:
Mark receives $1,200 per month in CPP (or $14,400 annually) and is taxed at a 42% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. His spouse, Linda, has no CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. By splitting 50% of his CPP with Linda, Mark's taxable income drops to $7,200, taxed at 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Linda's $7,200 is taxed at only 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This strategy reduces their total tax bill from $6,048 to $4,750, a savings of almost $1,300 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Pension Income Splitting

[[Pension Income Splitting|Pension income splitting]] allows retirees aged 65 and older to allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income, such as RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) payments or annuities, to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This allocation can be adjusted annually based on their tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

**Example** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>:
Sarah receives $60,000 annually in RRIF income, taxed at 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Her spouse, John, earns $40,000 and is taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. By allocating 50% ($30,000) of her RRIF income to John, Sarah's taxable income is reduced, and they both benefit from John's lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This strategy saves them $3,900 annually by lowering their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It also helps prevent potential OAS clawbacks, allowing them to retain more retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Spousal RRSP Contributions

High-income earners can contribute to a spousal RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan), allowing income to be shifted to the lower-income spouse upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This practice equalizes retirement withdrawals and reduces overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

**Example** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>:
Emma, who earns $120,000 per year, contributes $10,000 annually to a spousal RRSP for her husband, Liam, who earns $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. By the time they retire, Liam's spousal RRSP has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. In retirement, Liam withdraws $20,000 per year from the spousal RRSP, taxed at his lower rate of 15% instead of Emma's higher rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This shift results in a tax savings of $3,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

**Considerations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>:
*   Withdrawals are taxed in the lower-income spouse's hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   The attribution rule applies: Contributions made within two years of withdrawals will be taxed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Advanced Strategies

### Family Trusts

Family trusts can be a versatile part of a retirement plan, allowing for tax-saving strategies like [[income_splitting_to_reduce_tax_burden|income splitting]], capital gains exemptions, and bypassing probate fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

**Income Splitting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>:
Income from trust-held assets can potentially be allocated to family members in lower tax brackets, reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. For example, if trust investment income is generated, it can be directed to family members with a lower tax rate, allowing the family to collectively save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

**Key Considerations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>:
*   **Attribution Rules**: Income generated from transferred assets may still be taxed back to the original owner, reducing income splitting benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Proper structuring of family assets is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **21-Year Rule**: Trust assets are deemed disposed of every 21 years, triggering capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Planning to transfer assets to beneficiaries before this deadline can avoid this tax impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

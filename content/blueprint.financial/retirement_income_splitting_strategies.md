[[Income splitting strategies]] can help retirees reduce their overall tax burden, especially when one spouse or common-law partner is in a higher tax bracket than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## CPP/QPP Pension Sharing

This strategy allows higher-income retirees to allocate a portion of their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) payments to a lower-income spouse, thereby reducing the household's total tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Eligibility
For pension sharing, both spouses must be at least 60 years old, live together, and have made contributions to either CPP or QPP during their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Example
Mark receives $1,200 per month in CPP, totaling $14,400 annually, and is at a 42% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. His spouse, Linda, has no CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

By splitting 50% of his CPP with Linda:
*   Mark's taxable income drops to $7,200, taxed at 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Linda's income also becomes $7,200, but is taxed at a lower 22% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

This reduces their total tax bill from $6,048 to $4,750, resulting in a savings of almost $1,300 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## [[Pension income splitting]]

[[Pension income splitting in Canada]] allows retirees aged 65 and older to allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This includes income from sources such as Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) payments or annuities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, and the allocated amount can be adjusted annually based on their tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Example
Sarah receives $60,000 annually in RRIF income, taxed at a 33% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Her spouse, John, earns $40,000 and is taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

By allocating 50% of her RRIF income, or $30,000, to John:
*   Sarah's taxable income is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   They both benefit from John's lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This strategy saves them $3,900 annually by lowering their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> and helps prevent potential OAS clawbacks, allowing them to retain more of their [[understanding_income_sources_and_withdrawal_strategies_in_retirement | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Spousal RRSP Contributions

High-income earners can contribute to a spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), which allows income to be shifted to the lower-income spouse upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This helps equalize retirement withdrawals and reduces overall taxes for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Example
Emma earns $120,000 per year and contributes $10,000 annually to a spousal RRSP for her husband, Liam, who earns $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. By the time they retire, Liam's spousal RRSP has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

In retirement, Liam withdraws $20,000 per year from the spousal RRSP, taxed at his lower rate of 15% instead of Emma's higher rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This shift results in a tax savings of $3,000 annually, reducing their household tax burden and providing more income at a lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Considerations
*   **Attribution Rule**: While withdrawals are taxed in the lower-income spouse's hand, contributions made within two years of withdrawals will be taxed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

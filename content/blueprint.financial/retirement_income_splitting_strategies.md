[[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | Income splitting strategies]] are effective methods to help retirees reduce their overall tax burden, particularly when one spouse or common-law partner is in a significantly higher tax bracket than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. These proven strategies can help keep more money in retirement for various pursuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## CPP or QPP Pension Sharing

This strategy involves sharing Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Why it Works
By sharing CPP benefits, higher-income retirees can allocate a portion of their payments to a lower-income spouse, which reduces the household's total tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Eligibility
Both spouses must be at least 60 years old, live together, and have made contributions to either CPP or QPP during their relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Example
Mark receives $1,200 per month in CPP, totaling $14,400 annually, and is in a 42% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. His spouse, Linda, has no CPP income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. By splitting 50% of his CPP with Linda, Mark's taxable income drops to $7,200, which is taxed at 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Linda also receives $7,200, but hers is taxed at only 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | income splitting strategies]] reduces their total tax bill from $6,048 to $4,752, resulting in annual savings of almost $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Pension Income Splitting Strategy

This strategy focuses on splitting eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### How it Works
Retirees aged 65 and older can allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income, such as Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) payments or annuities, to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This allocation can be adjusted annually based on their tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Example
Sarah receives $60,000 annually in RRIF income, taxed at a 33% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Her spouse, John, earns $40,000 and is taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. By allocating 50% of her RRIF income ($30,000) to John, Sarah's taxable income is reduced, and they both benefit from John's lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This [[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | pension income splitting]] strategy saves them $3,900 annually by lowering their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It also helps prevent potential Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks, allowing them to retain more of their retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Spousal RRSP Contributions

[[Income splitting with RRSPs | Spousal RRSP contributions]] are an effective way to shift income for tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Why it's Effective
High-income earners can contribute to a spousal RRSP, allowing income to be shifted to the lower-income spouse when they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This strategy equalizes retirement withdrawals and reduces overall taxes for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Example
Emma earns $120,000 per year and contributes $10,000 annually to a spousal RRSP for her husband, Liam, who earns $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. By the time they retire, Liam's spousal RRSP has grown significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. In retirement, Liam withdraws $20,000 per year from the spousal RRSP, which is taxed at his lower rate of 15% instead of Emma's higher rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This shift results in a tax savings of $3,000 annually, reducing their household tax burden and providing more income at a lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Considerations
*   **Attribution Rule:** While withdrawals are taxed in the lower-income spouse's hand, contributions made within two years of withdrawals will be taxed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Proper Structuring:** Proper structuring of these family assets is crucial to maximize [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_families_and_retirees | income splitting benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

These [[income_splitting_for_tax_savings | income splitting strategies]] can be complex for many couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

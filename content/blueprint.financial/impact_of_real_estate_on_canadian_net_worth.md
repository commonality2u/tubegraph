Canadian household net worth saw a steady increase between 2020 and 2024, largely fueled by gains in real estate and financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Net worth rose from approximately $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Although there was a slight dip to about $979,000 in 2023, attributed to inflation and post-pandemic spending, it recovered to over $1 million by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Real Estate's Dominant Role
Real estate is a cornerstone of Canadian wealth, accounting for over 50% of household net worth during this period, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This highlights the significant reliance Canadians place on property for building and storing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The appreciation of real estate drove much of the net worth increase from $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Risks of Heavy Reliance
However, this heavy reliance on real estate carries risks. A downturn in the housing market could severely impact households, potentially wiping out a substantial portion of their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pro Tip: Diversify Your Portfolio
> While real estate may seem like a safe investment, it's crucial to diversify your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Over-reliance on a single asset class, especially in a volatile market, significantly increases risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Spreading investments across real estate, stocks, bonds, and other assets can help protect against potential downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

A significant wealth gap exists between homeowners and renters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In 2024, homeowners boasted an average net worth of $1.38 million, nearly five times higher than renters, whose average net worth was $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This disparity is primarily driven by real estate appreciation, which significantly boosts the net worth of homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Renters, with limited exposure to real estate, predominantly build wealth through financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Both groups saw steady net worth growth from 2020 to 2024, with homeowners experiencing a 33% increase and renters a 31% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Impact Across Demographics

Real estate plays a crucial role in wealth accumulation across different life stages. Net worth typically peaks in the 45-to-54 and 55-to-64 age groups, significantly driven by real estate and retirement growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This period is considered the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### [[household_vs_individual_net_worth | Net Worth by Household Type]]
Real estate also influences the wealth disparity between single-person and multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. For multi-person households, real estate makes up 55% of their net worth, compared to 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This suggests that multi-person households may be better positioned to afford property, while single-person households might face challenges in the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## International Comparison
Canada's average net worth, while lower than Switzerland and the U.S. (in USD terms), sits between the UK and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Interestingly, Australia's median net worth is 80% higher than Canada's, and its average net worth is 34% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This elevated net worth in Australia is likely bolstered by what is described as a "massive housing bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, suggesting a similar real estate-driven wealth dynamic.

## Strategies for Increasing Net Worth Through Real Estate
Net worth data serves as a valuable tool for setting financial goals and building wealth strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

*   **Leverage Real Estate**: Real estate significantly contributes to wealth building in Canada, making up over 50% of the average Canadian's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If homeownership is a goal, work towards it, or consider how to leverage property you already own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

By understanding the role of real estate in overall wealth, individuals can make informed decisions to optimize their financial position.

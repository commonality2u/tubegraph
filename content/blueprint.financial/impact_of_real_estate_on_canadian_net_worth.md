From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Canadian household net worth has seen a steady increase, rising from approximately $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This growth was largely driven by real estate and financial market gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although there was a slight dip in 2023, bringing net worth down to about $979,000 due to [[impact_of_inflation_on_canadians_financial_struggles | inflation]] and post-pandemic spending, it recovered to over $1 million by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Real Estate's Dominant Role

Real estate plays a significant role in Canadian wealth, often comprising over 50% of household net worth, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This highlights how much Canadians rely on property to build and store wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The appreciation of real estate has been a primary driver behind the increase in net worth from $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

> Heavy reliance on real estate can make households vulnerable to downturns in the housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. To mitigate this risk, it is important to diversify investments across various asset classes such as real estate, stocks, and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

Data reveals a significant [[wealth_disparity_between_homeowners_and_renters_in_canada | wealth gap between homeowners and renters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In 2024, homeowners had an average net worth of $1.38 million, nearly five times higher than renters, whose average net worth was $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This disparity is primarily due to real estate appreciation, which substantially boosts the net worth of homeowners, while renters largely rely on financial assets for wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

[[average_net_worth_in_canada_by_age_group | Net worth evolves through different stages of life]]. Real estate significantly contributes to the peak net worth observed in the 45 to 54 and 55 to 64 age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In 2024, those aged 45 to 54 had an average net worth of $1.35 million, and those aged 55 to 64 reached $1.6 million, largely driven by real estate and retirement growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## [[net_worth_differences_by_household_type_in_canada | Net Worth by Household Type]]

Real estate also plays a major role in [[net_worth_differences_by_household_type_in_canada | net worth differences by household type in Canada]]. For multi-person households, real estate makes up 55% of their net worth, compared to 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This suggests that multi-person households may be more able to afford property, while single individuals might find themselves priced out of the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | Net Worth by Income Level]]

Middle-income households (those in the 41% to 80% income group) have shown the fastest percentage growth in net worth, quietly building wealth by benefiting from rising real estate values and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This demonstrates that substantial net worth growth is achievable even outside the top 20% income earners, through smart investing and asset accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## International Comparison

In an international comparison of net worth, Australia stands out with a median net worth 80% higher than Canadians and an average net worth 34% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These figures are likely inflated by Australia's significant housing bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, further underscoring the impact of real estate on national wealth.

## Using Net Worth Data to Improve Your Finances

Leveraging real estate is a key strategy for wealth building in Canada, as over 50% of the average Canadian's wealth comes from real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If home ownership is a goal, it is advised to work towards it or consider how to leverage property already owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

The creator of Wealth Awesome.com embarked on a "wild adventure" in 2019 with a financial goal of earning $3,000 a month from the website and attracting 30,000 monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This goal was eventually exceeded by almost ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The venture allowed the founder to achieve their dream of living a [[digital_nomad_lifestyle_through_blogging | digital nomad lifestyle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, working remotely and traveling the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The site was also started to create something positive that would educate Canadians and provide a sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Starting Wealth Awesome

Before launching Wealth Awesome, the founder wrote for various Canadian media and investment publications on finance-related topics, including CTV News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This established a following of tens of thousands of monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The idea to start their own financial education site came from a friend, who suggested it given the positive response to their existing writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Observing the existing Canadian financial education blogs, the creator realized they could produce content of equal or better quality, leveraging their extensive education and experience in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Recognizing an opportunity to create great content and share their [[digital_nomad_lifestyle_through_blogging | digital nomad]] journey while indulging a love for writing, Wealth Awesome.com was launched in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Earning Income

Generating income from blogging was not an immediate process. The first dollar was earned about a year after the site's launch, in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This first earning was a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. By this point, the founder had written over 150 articles and dedicated hundreds of hours to the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This initial $50 served as a validation that the idea could work, and from there, income generation "snowballed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The initial goal of $3,000 per month was reached in February 2021, approximately a year and a half after the site's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. In its peak months, the site earned over $20,000 per month, at one point almost reaching $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Cumulatively, Wealth Awesome generated over $500,000 from the website, excluding the eventual sale of the site (the sale amount remains confidential) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Income Streams

Income from Wealth Awesome was primarily generated through two main avenues: advertising and affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

#### Advertising
Once a website achieves a certain level of traffic, it can apply to premium ad networks that help find advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Wealth Awesome applied to Mediavine after reaching 50,000 visitors per month (Mediavine's requirement has since been lowered to 10,000 visitors per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Ad networks typically pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille), which measures earnings per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For finance content on Mediavine, RPMs were notably high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This meant that for 10,000 visitors, the site could earn approximately $500 USD (or nearly $700 Canadian) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

#### Affiliate Commissions
Affiliate commissions involve earning money by recommending and referring specific products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The creator only chose to recommend products they genuinely believed in and personally used, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank, which became top affiliate partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The process works similarly to recommending a product to a friend, but with the added benefit of being compensated for the referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

For example, an article on Wealth Awesome.com reviewing the top trading platforms in Canada included links to recommended products that had been tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. If a reader signed up through these links, the site would receive a commission, typically ranging from $50 to $100, with some partners paying even more, such as $150 or $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This arrangement was described as a "win-win scenario," where users found valuable products or services, and the site received compensation for credible referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Website Traffic and Growth

The site experienced a slow start in terms of traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Traction began after writing around 100 articles, about 11 months into the journey, reaching approximately 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. From there, traffic progressed rapidly; by January 2021, it had increased tenfold to 50,000 visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Wealth Awesome peaked at around 250,000 visitors per month in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Overall, the site attracted approximately 5 million visitors throughout its operational years, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In addition to the website, a linked YouTube channel gained almost 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

The growth of Wealth Awesome was also attributed to fortunate timing, as it launched just before the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to more people being indoors, online, and interested in learning about personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Evolution and Sale of Wealth Awesome

The creator learned numerous technical skills, including website design and building, search engine optimization (SEO), content creation, graphic design, website data analysis, affiliate partner network building, website monetization, hiring and managing personnel, and utilizing various online business tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Past experiences as an analyst, in business-to-business sales, and as a financial advisor were instrumental in the site's growth, aiding in SEO analysis, promotion, and content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Despite its success, the site was eventually sold for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. After several years, the founder began to lose passion for the work, finding it harder to motivate and produce amazing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. There was also uncertainty about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, which caused stress and prompted a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The site was sold to a trusted friend, Q, who sought to add digital assets to his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Following the sale, the founder started a new venture, Blueprint Financial, a financial planning company that builds customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This new direction aligns with their values and skills, allowing them to bring real value to Canadians and businesses nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This builds upon previous experience as a financial advisor, a role that provided personal satisfaction through intimate one-on-one connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

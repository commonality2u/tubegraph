Making informed decisions about when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can significantly impact an individual's [[financial_planning_for_retirement | financial stability]] and overall [[retirement income | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While starting CPP at age 60 might seem appealing, there are several reasons why delaying it could be a more beneficial [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | strategy]] for long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying CPP for Increased Income

### Higher Monthly Benefits
One of the most apparent benefits of delaying CPP is receiving higher monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Starting CPP at age 60 results in a 0.6% reduction per month, totaling a 36% reduction compared to starting at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. For example, a baseline of $1,000 per month at age 65 would be reduced to $640 per month at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP until age 70 increases benefits by 0.7% per month, accumulating to a 42% increase over starting at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means the $1,000 baseline at age 65 would become $1,420 per month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP to age 70 can more than double the monthly benefit compared to starting it at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Leveraging Existing Income or Savings
If an individual has sufficient income or savings to cover expenses between ages 60 and 70, delaying CPP is a viable [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Drawing from a solid retirement savings portfolio, which may include Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), or workplace pensions, allows personal investments to continue growing while deferring CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   This approach can significantly boost [[retirement income | retirement income]] starting at age 70, leading to enhanced [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | financial stability]] and a more comfortable retirement in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Great Health and Life Expectancy
For individuals in good health, delaying CPP beyond age 60 can be a beneficial choice due to increasing life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   A 60-year-old in Canada is currently expected to live to approximately 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Starting CPP at age 60 locks in a lower monthly amount for life, which might not be sufficient to cover needs if one lives longer than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP helps hedge against the risk of outliving other [[financial_planning_for_retirement | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   The break-even point for earning more from CPP by delaying from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Inflation Protection
Concerns about [[inflation_and_retirement_planning | inflation]] can be mitigated by delaying CPP, as the benefits are indexed to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   CPP payouts increase to match high inflation, with the rate increasing by 4.4% in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP means larger inflation-indexed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This feature makes CPP a unique and valuable pension for supporting retirees during periods of high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Trust in CPP Management
The CPP is designed to be financially sustainable for the long term, reducing concerns about its availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   CPP contributions are projected to increase significantly, from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 for the base CPP, and from $9.3 billion to $45 billion for the additional CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   Regular independent peer reviews confirm the CPP's financial sustainability for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   The CPP Investment Portfolio has achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as of the 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Avoiding OAS Clawback
Delaying CPP can be a strategic move to manage overall taxable income and potentially avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   OAS payments, which can be up to $784 per month, are subject to clawback if an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold ($90,995 as of the latest figures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   By delaying CPP, individuals can manage their other income sources (employment, pensions, investments) to stay below the clawback threshold, maximizing their OAS benefits while still receiving higher CPP payments later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Not Qualifying for Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
If an individual anticipates a higher income in retirement from sources like RSPs or work pensions, they likely won't qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In such cases, delaying CPP means receiving larger CPP payments, which will increase overall income, but it won't affect GIS eligibility if the income is already above the qualifying limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### RSP Tax Planning
Delaying CPP can facilitate RSP tax planning, allowing individuals to draw down their RSPs earlier in retirement to minimize taxes upon death and leave more money for their estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   Between ages 60 and 70, individuals can use RSP withdrawals to cover living expenses, reducing their RSP balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Once enhanced CPP benefits begin at age 70, the reliance on other income sources, like RSPs, decreases, which can lead to lower taxes upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Still Working in Your 60s
If an individual plans to continue working into their 60s or 70s, delaying CPP makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   Working income can cover expenses, eliminating the immediate need for CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Continued work requires ongoing CPP contributions between ages 60 and 65, even if benefits are started early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   The benefit of delaying CPP for increased future payments is likely greater than taking it early and attempting to invest it, as achieving comparable returns in the market can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### More Predictable and Stable Income
Delaying CPP can provide a more predictable and stable [[retirement income | income]] stream later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   While delaying, individuals may draw from their investments (RSP, TFSA, non-registered assets) to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   This approach involves trading potentially uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in CPP payments, ensuring a higher, inflation-adjusted income for the rest of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Conclusion
The decision of when to start CPP benefits is deeply personal and depends on individual [[assessing_your_current_financial_situation_before_retirement | financial situations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While delaying CPP often leads to greater [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | financial stability]] and higher guaranteed income in later retirement years, it's crucial to evaluate all [[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | factors affecting retiree financial security]] to make the most informed choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Expert guidance through [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | comprehensive financial planning for retirement]] can help optimize CPP and other [[retirement income | retirement benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

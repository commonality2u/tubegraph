Claiming [[how_to_claim_medical_expenses_on_taxes_in_Canada | medical expenses]] on your tax return can be complex, but understanding the rules allows families to [[maximizing_tax_refunds_from_medical_expenses | maximize a refund]] and keep more of their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) enables Canadians to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions | eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

## How the Medical Expense Tax Credit Works

To claim the METC, medical expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return:
*   Line 33099 is for expenses incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.
*   Line 33199 is for expenses for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. From your total eligible expenses, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. The resulting amount is claimed as a non-refundable credit, which reduces your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Example: Jessica's Claim
Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024.
*   3% of her net income is $1,500 ($50,000 * 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,500 = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Common Eligible Medical Expenses
While the focus is on family strategies, it's important to know what generally qualifies:
*   **Prescribed Drugs and Medications**: These must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Medical marijuana is also covered if prescribed and purchased from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Dental and Vision Care**: Eligible expenses include services from licensed professionals such as dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists. This covers routine checkups, fillings, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening are not eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   *Pro Tip*: Higher-income earners might benefit from timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Travel Expenses**: If you travel at least 40 km one way for medical services unavailable locally, you can claim transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. If traveling over 80 km, meals and accommodations can also be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Travel costs for an accompanied person can also be claimed if certified as necessary by a medical practitioner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Private Health Insurance Premiums**: Premiums paid out-of-pocket for private health insurance covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization may be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Family plans allow claiming premiums for your spouse and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Medical Devices and Equipment**: Costs for items like wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopods, and certain home modifications (e.g., wheelchair ramps) can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. A doctor's prescription is often required, and ongoing maintenance costs (like batteries) may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

Properly claiming family medical expenses can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Knowing who in the family should claim these expenses is crucial for [[examples_of_family_and_retirement_tax_stacking_strategies | maximizing tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

### Family Claim Optimization Example: Richard and Pauline
Consider Richard and Pauline, a couple with a 16-year-old daughter Jen and a 19-year-old son Rob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Their medical expenses for the year were:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>
*   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>
*   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>
*   Total: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses ($1,800) are combined with Richard and Pauline's, totaling $6,300, which are eligible for Line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

To determine who should claim the combined $6,300:
*   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Richard**: Earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim is key to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

Understanding these strategies can contribute to effective tax planning and overall wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

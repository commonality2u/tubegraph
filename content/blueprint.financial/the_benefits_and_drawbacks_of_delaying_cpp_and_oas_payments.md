Retirement planning in Canada involves understanding various government benefits, including the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS). One strategic approach to optimize these benefits and manage your taxable income is to [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delay your CPP]] and OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This strategy can lead to higher lifelong payments and potentially reduce the impact of the OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## How the OAS Clawback Works

The OAS clawback triggers when your income exceeds a certain threshold. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. A 15% recovery tax is applied to the amount of income over this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If your income reaches or exceeds $153,700 for those under 75, or $158,619 annually for those aged 75 and over, the entire OAS benefit can be clawed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

> [!example] David's OAS Clawback
> David, a 75-year-old, has an income of $160,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Because his income is well over the clawback threshold, the 15% recovery tax on the amount above the threshold ($90,995) totals $10,300. Since his annual OAS benefit ($9,481) is less than this amount, David loses all of his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying CPP Payments

[[delaying_cpp_benefits | Delaying your CPP payments]] is one of the most effective strategies to reduce the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

*   **Increased Payments**: By delaying your CPP payments until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70, you can increase your monthly CPP payments by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For instance, if you are eligible for $1,000 per month at age 65, delaying until age 70 would increase your monthly payments to $1,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Reduced Taxable Income**: Delaying CPP lowers your taxable income between the ages of 65 and 70, which is typically when the OAS clawback begins to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Inflation Protection**: CPP payments are indexed to inflation, meaning these higher payments will continue to grow in value for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> [!example] Peter's CPP Delay Savings
> Peter, at age 65, faces an OAS clawback of $811 due to a high taxable income from drawing both CPP and other retirement income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By choosing to [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delay CPP]], his taxable income is reduced, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $584. This represents a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback by delaying CPP alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Additionally, he secures higher CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying OAS Payments

Another smart strategy is to consider [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delaying your OAS payments]] up to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

*   **Increased Payments**: Delaying OAS increases your monthly payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For example, $500 per month at age 65 becomes $680 per month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Clawback Reduction/Elimination**: This strategy reduces or even eliminates the clawback during the earlier years of retirement (65-70) when your income could potentially be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> [!example] Peter's OAS Delay Savings
> Peter faces an OAS clawback of $811 at age 65 due to high taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. By [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delaying OAS]] until age 70, the entire clawback is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This means he avoids losing benefits when his income is higher and instead receives a higher monthly OAS payment after age 70, a 36% increase over receiving it at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Considerations for Delaying CPP and OAS

While delaying these benefits can be highly advantageous, it's not always the best option for everyone.

*   **Health and Life Expectancy**: If you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy, delaying may not be the most beneficial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Individualized Planning**: It is crucial to plan specifically for your own situation, as what works for one person (like Peter with his higher income between ages 65-70) may not be the case for another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

[[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Delaying CPP and OAS]] is just one piece of a comprehensive retirement plan. Other strategies, such as using a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) wisely and managing Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) withdrawals, can further help in avoiding the OAS clawback and preserving more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. These smart financial moves can potentially save you thousands in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

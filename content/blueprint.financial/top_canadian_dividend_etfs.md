Dividend ETFs are popular in Canada, with billions of dollars invested in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article ranks the top five Canadian dividend ETFs and discusses why the overall selection might not be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## 5. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

XDV is designed for investors seeking steady, high-quality dividends from strong Canadian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, selecting stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Strong Dividend Payers**: Holds 31 high-yield Canadian stocks selected for dividend consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Monthly Distributions**: Provides monthly payouts, making it ideal for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Financials-Heavy**: Nearly 60% of the ETF is composed of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Performance & Costs
*   **Dividend Yield**: Approximately 4.2% as of January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: 0.55% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This is considered a bit higher than some alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Assets Under Management (AUM)**: $1.76 billion, indicating its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Top Holdings
The fund is dominated by Canadian financials, making up nearly 60% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Top holdings include:
*   Canadian Tire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   RBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
*   Bank of Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   CIBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
These companies have strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Who Should Invest?
*   **Ideal for**: Retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts and exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Not ideal for**: Growth investors, as it prioritizes income over capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
XDV is a solid pick for those wanting monthly income and exposure to stable, high-yield Canadian companies, but its heavy reliance on financial stocks and moderate fees should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

ZWC is an income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks and uses a covered call strategy to enhance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy results in higher monthly dividends but with very limited upside potential for stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### How Covered Calls Work
ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks, earning extra income (premiums) in exchange for capping potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If stock prices remain flat or fall, ZWC keeps the premium, boosting its dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.If stock prices rise above the strike price, ZWC must sell at the set price, missing out on larger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Essentially, ZWC trades growth potential for more stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Enhanced Income Strategy**: Uses covered calls to generate extra income, leading to a higher-than-average yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Monthly Distributions**: Ideal for retirees or income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Diversified Canadian Portfolio**: Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Performance & Costs
*   **Dividend Yield**: 6.62% as of February 27th, 2025, higher than average due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:56">[02:03:56]</a>.
*   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 12% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>. The 5-year average is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>.
*   **MER**: 0.72% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:13">[02:04:13]</a>, higher than traditional dividend ETFs due to active options management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:17">[02:04:17]</a>.
*   **Trading Expense Ratio (TER)**: 0.20%, for a total expense of 0.92% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:21">[02:04:21]</a>, making it the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:25">[02:04:25]</a>.
*   **AUM**: $1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:29">[02:04:29]</a>.

### Top Holdings
The ETF is heavily weighted towards financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:35">[02:04:35]</a>. Top holdings include:
*   Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotia Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:39">[02:04:39]</a>
*   CIBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:41">[02:04:41]</a>
*   Enbridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:42">[02:04:42]</a>
*   Manulife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:43">[02:04:43]</a>
*   RBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:44">[02:04:44]</a>
*   TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:45">[02:04:45]</a>
These are stable, high-yield dividend payers, but the covered call strategy caps growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:48">[02:04:48]</a>.

### Who Should Invest?
*   **Ideal for**: Retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:55">[02:04:55]</a>. Good for RSP and TFSA investors who don't need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.
*   **Not ideal for**: Growth-focused investors, as covered calls limit potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:05">[02:05:05]</a>.
ZWC is a strong choice for investors wanting high monthly income with reduced market volatility, making it better suited for purely income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:10">[02:05:10]</a>. A TFSA could be a great place to hold this to shield the high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:29">[02:05:29]</a>.

## 3. iShares S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)

CDZ invests in Canadian companies that have increased their dividends every year for at least five consecutive years, known as "dividend aristocrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:53">[02:05:53]</a>. It's a solid choice for those seeking stable dividend growth and monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Dividend Growth Focus**: Includes only stocks with a proven track record of raising dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
*   **Broad Diversification**: Holds 91 stocks across multiple sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:12">[02:06:12]</a>.
*   **Monthly Distributions**: Ideal for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>.

### Performance & Costs
*   **Dividend Yield**: 3.79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:21">[02:06:21]</a>.
*   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 20.07% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:26">[02:06:26]</a>.
*   **MER**: 0.66% per year, slightly higher than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:28">[02:06:28]</a>.
*   **AUM**: Just shy of $1 billion at $940 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:32">[02:06:32]</a>.

### Top Holdings
CDZ is less concentrated in financials compared to other dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:38">[02:06:38]</a>. Top holdings include:
*   BCE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:45">[02:06:45]</a>
*   Allied Properties REIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:46">[02:06:46]</a>
*   Fiera Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>
*   Telus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:49">[02:06:49]</a>
*   Southb Corp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>
This diversification can help reduce risk compared to ETFs heavily weighted towards banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:51">[02:06:51]</a>.

### Who Should Invest?
*   **Ideal for**: Dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:57">[02:06:57]</a>. It is also more diversified than other bank-heavy dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>.
*   **Not ideal for**: Maximum yield seekers, as it has lower dividend rates compared to some other ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.
CDZ is a great choice for long-term investors who value steady dividend growth and broad sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a>.

[!TIP]
For all ETFs on this list, consider setting up a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) to supercharge long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:27">[02:07:27]</a>.

## 2. Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VDY)

### Top Holdings

### Who Should Invest?

*   **Not ideal for**: [[limitations_of_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversification seekers]], as over 85% is in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:53">[02:08:53]</a>.
VDY is a strong, low-cost option for investors focused on high monthly dividend income. While it lacks sector diversification, its focus on Canada's largest dividend payers makes it a good fit for income-seeking investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:57">[02:08:57]</a>.

## 1. iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XEQ)

### Top Holdings
Like others on this list, XEQ is heavily weighted towards financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:23">[02:10:23]</a>. Top holdings include:
*   Enbridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:28">[02:10:28]</a>
*   TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>

XEQ is the top choice for dividend ETFs in Canada due to its low cost and focus on high-quality dividend features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:47">[02:10:47]</a>. While it lacks sector diversification, its focus on financially strong companies and low fees makes it a compelling long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:56">[02:10:56]</a>.

## Why Canadian Dividend ETFs Are Not Always Ideal

While ETFs are generally favored, Canadian dividend ETFs have several [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | downsides]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:03">[02:11:03]</a>.

### 1. Higher Fees
Dividend ETFs often come with higher-than-average MERs, which can significantly reduce returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>. For example, XDV charges a 0.55% MER but only holds 31 stocks, offering poor diversification for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:19">[02:11:19]</a>. A $1,000 investment in XDV would incur $5.50 per year in fees, which compounds and cuts into long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:28">[02:11:28]</a>. To mitigate this, seek lower MER dividend ETFs like the top two on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:40">[02:11:40]</a>.

### 2. Less Diversification
Most Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:46">[02:11:46]</a>. VDY, for instance, has over 85% exposure to just these two sectors, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:54">[02:11:54]</a>. XDV holds only 31 stocks, and XEQ holds only 20, meaning they do not provide broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>. In contrast, a truly diversified ETF like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies, areas where Canadian dividend ETFs are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:07">[02:12:07]</a>. If true diversification is desired, dividend ETFs alone may not suffice, and building a personal portfolio or choosing a globally diversified ETF like VGRO might be better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:22">[02:12:22]</a>.

### 3. US Dividend Stocks Might Be a Better Option
Many of the best dividend stocks are in the US market, offering higher dividend growth rates, potentially more sector diversification, and more blue-chip companies with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:40">[02:12:40]</a>. Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might be better off investing directly in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:52">[02:12:52]</a>. Another strategy is to combine a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:02">[02:13:02]</a>.

[!TIP]
For [[comparison_between_canadian_and_us_dividend_stocks | US dividend stocks]], consider holding them in an RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) and not a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) to avoid withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>. This relates to [[risks_of_keeping_noncanadian_dividend_stocks_in_tfsas | tax saving strategies for investments in Canada]].

In conclusion, Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool for those who prefer not to buy individual dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:17">[02:13:17]</a>. However, concerns regarding high fees, lack of diversification, and lack of control are real [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | concerns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:22">[02:13:22]</a>.

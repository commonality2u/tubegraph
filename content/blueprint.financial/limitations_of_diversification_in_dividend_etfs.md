While [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] are popular, they often present [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | limitations in diversification]] that investors should consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. These ETFs can be heavily concentrated in specific sectors and a limited number of holdings, potentially exposing investors to unforeseen risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

## Sector Concentration

Many [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] are predominantly invested in the financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>:

*   **iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)**
    *   Nearly 60% of XDV is composed of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:19">[01:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This heavy reliance on financial stocks is a notable characteristic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)**
    *   ZWC's portfolio is heavily weighted towards financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VDY)**
    *   VDY has over 85% exposure to financials and energy, making it susceptible to downturns in these specific sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Its top 10 holdings alone constitute 70.6% of the fund, indicating a high concentration in a few major sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.
*   **iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XEQT)**
    *   While a top pick for its low cost, XEQT is also heavily weighted towards financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

### Exception: iShares S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)

CDZ offers comparatively better diversification, being less concentrated in financials than other dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. This broad sector exposure can help reduce risk compared to bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

## Limited Number of Holdings

Beyond sector concentration, some dividend ETFs hold a relatively small number of stocks, limiting true market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>:

*   XDV holds only 31 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   XEQT is concentrated in just 20 holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

This narrow focus means investors are not getting broad market exposure typical of a truly diversified ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

## Comparison with Truly Diversified ETFs

In contrast to dividend ETFs, a truly diversified ETF like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. This highlights the limited scope of diversification found within [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.

## Potential Solutions

*   **Building Your Own Portfolio**: Investors might consider building their own diversified portfolio of 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks from both Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.
*   **Globally Diversified ETFs**: Opting for a globally diversified ETF, such as an [[benefits_of_allinone_etfs | All-in-One ETF]], can provide broader market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.
*   **US Dividend Stocks**: Many of the best dividend stocks are in the US market, offering higher dividend growth rates, more sector diversification, and global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Consider holding these in an RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) rather than a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) to avoid withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

Ultimately, while [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] offer convenience, their higher fees, lack of diversification, and limited control are real concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

Many Canadian retirees can significantly reduce their tax bill by strategically managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals and Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A common mistake is leaving money on the table by not properly managing RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Utilizing a smart RSP-to-TFSA tactic can lead to reduced taxes, boosted tax-free growth, and a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Unused TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue for retirees is wasted TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Statistics show that out of 17.77 million Canadians holding a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to [[maximizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | max out their contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This indicates that the majority are missing out on the substantial tax-free growth potential of the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully [[maximizing_tfsa_benefits | maximize their TFSA contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60 to 64, only 9.48% [[maximizing_tfsa_benefits | maximize contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, peaking at 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This strategy helps explain why this number more than doubles between the ages of 75 to 79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are excellent for saving during working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, but withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. At age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates converting RSPs into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) and beginning mandatory withdrawals, regardless of immediate need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RRIF-to-TFSA Transfer

If excess funds are withdrawn from an RSP or RRIF that are not needed for living expenses, they should be contributed to a TFSA and invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can save thousands in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in taxes, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. If Eddie only needs $11,000 for living expenses (covered by CPP, OAS, and pensions), he has $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Instead of putting this excess income into a normal savings account or taxable non-registered investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Assuming an average annual return of 6%:
*   **Year 1:** Eddie contributes $10,000, which grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie adds another $10,000 annually, and compounding accelerates growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, which has grown to approximately $132,000, all completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Comparison to Non-Registered Account

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would still grow at a 6% annual rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, with 30% of gains lost to taxes each year, his effective growth rate would drop to around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. After 10 years, his non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after accounting for taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, significantly less than the $132,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. If he had put it into a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the amount would be much lower, closer to $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

By contributing excess RRIF income to his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. His TFSA balance grows to $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, and potentially closer to $55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This approach maximizes retirement savings and offers the flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Pro Tips for [[strategies_for_maximizing_tfsa_contributions_and_growth | Maximizing TFSA Contributions]]

*   Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a portion of gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Does this eliminate RSP taxes on withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals are still considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA withdrawals, you can reduce your taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties like Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The goal is to minimize tax impact while [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_accounts | maximizing your overall retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

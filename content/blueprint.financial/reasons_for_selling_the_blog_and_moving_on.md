After years of building and growing Wealth Awesome, a financial blog, the author decided to sell the site and embark on new ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling Wealth Awesome

Several factors contributed to the decision to sell the successful financial blog:

*   **Loss of Passion** After several years, the author lost the passion for creating content for the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. It became harder to motivate to produce amazing content, and excitement for working on the website diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The author learned that once the "fire" is lost, it may be time to move on, suggesting they held onto the site for about a year longer than perhaps ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty in Blogging** There was growing uncertainty about the future direction of the site and the blogging industry itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Concerns included advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, which caused stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Diversification** The author sought to diversify away from the blogging business due to these uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### The Sale Process

The sale of the site happened serendipitously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. A close friend, Q, who previously worked with the author at CI Investments, reached out to inquire about purchasing the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Q was building a portfolio of digital assets after exiting another online business and wanted to add Wealth Awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The deal was finalized over a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The author was pleased the site went to a trusted friend who would bring fresh ideas and a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## What's Next: Blueprint Financial

The author is now focused on [[starting_a_new_financial_planning_company | starting a new business]] called Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### A New Financial Planning Company

Blueprint Financial aims to build customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The author is passionate about this venture, believing that most people haven't optimized their finances and that the company can provide significant value to individuals and businesses across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The author was approached by experienced business partners to collaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. They personally tested these financial plans on themselves and family members, realizing the immense value they provided in terms of peace of mind and potential financial growth for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Connection to Past Experience

This new role aligns with the author's past experience as a financial advisor in the corporate world, which was their favorite job due to the intimate one-on-one connections with clients and the personal satisfaction gained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The author plans to continue creating free financial content on their YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

## Overall Reflection

The journey with Wealth Awesome has been overwhelmingly positive, profoundly changing the author's life and, hopefully, helping many Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

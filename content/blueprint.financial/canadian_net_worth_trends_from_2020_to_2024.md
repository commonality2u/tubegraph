This article delves into Canadian net worth data from 2020 to 2024, examining how it stacks up against averages and within different demographics. It also explores how this data can be leveraged to improve personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overall Canadian Household Net Worth

Canadian household net worth has shown a steady increase from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It rose from approximately $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This growth was largely driven by [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate]] and financial market gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A slight dip occurred in 2023, bringing the average net worth down to about $979,000, likely due to inflation and post-pandemic spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. However, it recovered to over $1 million by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Key Drivers of Net Worth

### [[Impact of real estate on Canadian net worth | Real Estate's Role in Canadian Net Worth]]

[[Impact of real estate on Canadian net worth | Real estate]] plays a significant role in Canadian wealth, comprising over 50% of household net worth during this period, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This highlights Canadians' reliance on property for building and storing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The increase from $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million in 2024 was largely driven by [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] appreciation, despite increasing liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

However, heavy reliance on [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] means that a downturn in the housing market could significantly reduce household net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Diversify Your Portfolio
> While [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] may seem like a safe bet, it is crucial to diversify your investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Over-reliance on a single asset class increases risk, especially in volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Spreading investments across [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]], stocks, bonds, and other assets can help protect against potential downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Wealth Gaps and Demographic Breakdown

### Homeowners Versus Renters

A significant wealth gap exists between homeowners and renters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. In 2024, homeowners had an average net worth of $1.38 million, nearly five times higher than renters, who averaged $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Both groups saw steady growth in net worth from 2020 to 2024, with homeowners increasing by 33% and renters by 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The primary reason for this disparity is [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] appreciation, which significantly boosts homeowners' net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Renters, with limited exposure to [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]], primarily rely on financial assets for wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### [[Average net worth by age group in Canada | Average Net Worth by Age Group in Canada]]

Net worth evolves throughout different life stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The progression by age group in Canada from 2020 to 2024 is as follows:

*   **Less than 35 years:** Net worth is typically lower due to building assets and managing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Canadians under 35 saw their net worth grow from $231,000 in 2020 to $338,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Financial volatility is common in this group due to factors like student loans and early career challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **35 to 44 years:** Net worth grows significantly in this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. By 2024, the average net worth for this group reached $658,000, up from $490,000 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This is a crucial stage for investing in [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **45 to 54 years and 55 to 64 years:** Net worth peaks in these age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. In 2024, those aged 45 to 54 had $1.35 million in net worth, and 55 to 64-year-olds reached $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This growth is largely driven by [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, representing the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **65 years and older (De-accumulation Phase):** Net worth plateaus or grows modestly in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For those over 65, net worth rose from $863,000 in 2020 to $1.12 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, it drops from the previous age groups, indicating that people are drawing down assets for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Net Worth by Household Type

A clear wealth gap exists between one-person and multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By 2024, multi-person households had nearly double the net worth of one-person households ($1.17 million versus $634,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This difference is mainly due to multi-person households having larger total assets ($1.4 million versus $74,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, often because of two income providers and shared expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

However, one-person households are closing the growth gap, with their net worth increasing by 40% from 2020 to 2024, compared to 29.4% for multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. [[Impact of real estate on Canadian net worth | Real estate]] plays a major role for both groups, making up 55% of net worth for multi-person households and 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This suggests that multi-person households may be better able to afford property, while one-person households may be struggling with the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### The Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

According to a 2021 report from the PBO, the threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This group includes approximately 160,000 families and holds nearly 24.8% of the country's total net wealth, highlighting the increasing concentration of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Median Versus Average Net Worth

The **median** net worth is a more accurate measure than the **average** because it represents the middle point, where half of households have more and half have less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The average is skewed by the ultra-wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example, in 2019, the median net worth for multi-person households was $514,000, while the average in 2020 was $97,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This average is significantly distorted by individuals with vast wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

While Statistics Canada stopped reporting median net worth after 2019, it's estimated that the typical household's net worth is likely around 50% lower than the average today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Using the median as a benchmark provides a more realistic picture of financial standing for most Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Net Worth by Income Level

Net worth data by income level shows that higher earners generally have higher net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. In 2024, the top 20% of income earners had a net worth of over $2.29 million, more than six times that of the bottom 20%, who were at $375,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The top group gained almost $460,000 in just four years, further widening the wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

However, middle-income households (41% to 80% income group) experienced the fastest percentage growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. They have been accumulating wealth from rising [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] and investments, demonstrating that significant net worth growth is possible without being in the top 20% of income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Lower-income households saw modest gains of $123,000 over the same period but continue to face challenges in accessing high-growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Comparing Net Worth Internationally

When comparing net worth internationally, it's important to note that data from sources like the UBS Global Wealth Data Book are typically in US dollars and use different reporting standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

*   Canada's average net worth sits between that of the UK and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Switzerland stands out with an average net worth of $685,000 USD, 85% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The US average is 49% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   Germany's average is 31% lower than Canada's, and China's average is almost 80% lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   Australia's median net worth is 80% higher than Canada's, and its average net worth is 34% higher, likely supported by its significant housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## [[Strategies for increasing income and net worth in Canada | How to Use Net Worth Data to Increase Your Own Net Worth]]

Net worth data serves as a tool for setting realistic financial goals and strategically building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

1.  **Set Realistic Goals**: Use net worth data to understand your current standing and set achievable targets. For example, if the average for your age group is $400,000, aim to gradually surpass this benchmark with specific goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize Investing**: Wealthy households grow their net worth through investing, not solely by earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Evaluate your assets and ensure you are investing sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
3.  **Optimize Your Financial Assets**: Focus on optimizing your financial assets. Vehicles like the RRSP, [[tfsa_savings_trends_by_income_level | TFSA]], and other investment vehicles are key drivers of long-term wealth accumulation, especially for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
4.  **Leverage Real Estate**: [[Impact of real estate on Canadian net worth | Real estate]] plays a huge role in wealth building in Canada, making up over 50% of the average Canadian's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If ownership is a goal, work towards it, or consider how to leverage property you already own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
5.  **Benchmark and Track Progress**: Use [[strategies_for_wealthy_canadians | top earners' strategies]], such as minimizing debt and diversifying investments, to guide your financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Regularly track and adjust your strategy to stay on course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

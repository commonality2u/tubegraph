Despite concerns among 64% of Canadians that the CPP might not be available when they retire due to aging populations, rising costs, and potential provincial exits, the CPP is more secure than often perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This security is largely attributed to its robust investment strategies and effective management.

## Outperforming Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth]] has consistently outperformed expectations. In the fiscal year ending March 31st, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return, increasing the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This total asset amount significantly exceeds initial projections. For instance, in 2000, the CPP was expected to reach $425 billion by 2023, but it actually reached $632 billion in 2023, surpassing projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This overperformance is a direct result of smart investment strategies and sound long-term decisions made by fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even during challenging economic periods, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This growth ensures the CPP can effectively handle the increasing number of retirees today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Financial Reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>

The reliability of the CPP's financial reporting provides further assurance of its robust management. Several safeguards are in place:
*   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** This independent body provides an impartial assessment of the CPP's long-term [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | financial and actuarial considerations]] and health, operating free from political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 31st Actuarial report in 2022 confirmed the CPP's [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | sustainability of the CPP over the long term]] for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** The PBO reviews these reports, adding another layer of independent, transparent, and non-partisan scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Their role is to provide objective factual analysis and ensure data trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** External firms like Deloitte conduct audits. For example, Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, reinforcing trust in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

These multiple layers of scrutiny and transparency make the CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Investment Performance and Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>

The performance and management of CPP Investments are crucial to its long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Strong Long-Term Returns
CPP Investments has delivered strong long-term returns, with a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This performance has been instrumental in pushing the fund's assets to $632 billion, exceeding projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Diversified Global Portfolio
The fund employs a globally diversified portfolio across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It invests in various asset classes, including:
*   Public equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   Private equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   Infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the majority spread across international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This strategy helps reduce "home risk" by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy, thereby enhancing the fund's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Active Management Strategy
CPP Investments utilizes an active management approach to achieve returns, investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While this strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term, it can lead to underperformance in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. For example, the CPP's 8% net return for fiscal 2024 fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, for a pension fund like the CPP, active management is essential to address the complexities of [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | pension payouts]] and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The overall growth of CPP assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates the soundness of its investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Understanding the [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | strategies to optimize CPP benefits]] and [[tools_and_strategies_for_optimizing_cpp_benefits | tools and strategies for optimizing CPP benefits]], including knowing [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payout | when to start CPP]], can help Canadians leverage this secure retirement backbone for a more secure financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

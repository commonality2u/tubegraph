The amount you receive from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) retirement pension is significantly influenced by your contribution history and earnings throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The majority of Canadians receive less than the maximum possible payout, with the average Canadian getting 40% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Factors Affecting CPP Payouts

Several key [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | factors determine your CPP payouts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>:

*   **Contributions**: Your CPP retirement pension benefits depend heavily on the amount and duration of your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. The more you contribute and the longer your contribution period, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Average Earnings**: Your average earnings over your career also directly affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Consistently higher annual earnings that meet or exceed the YMPE lead to maximized CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Impact of Salary on CPP Contributions
[[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions | The more you earn]], the more you pay out of your paycheck to CPP, which in turn leads to higher CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

### Contribution Gaps and Their Effect on CPP
[[contribution_gaps_and_their_effect_on_cpp | Gaps in earnings]] or years with lower/no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. For example:
*   **Sarah**: Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period and consistently earned at or above the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This allowed her to max out her CPP benefits, receiving $1,364 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **David**: Had gaps in employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. He also had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Due to fewer contribution years and lower earnings, David received an average amount of $816 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize CPP Payments

You can potentially move from below-average or average CPP payments to the maximum through several strategies:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working and contributing to the plan up to age 70, you can earn a post-retirement benefit (PRB), which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### 2. Drop Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions to help exclude periods of low or no earnings from your calculation, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation:
*   **General Dropout Provision**: Allows you to drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equates to about 8 years if you contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Dropout**: If you took time off to raise children under the age of seven, these lower earning years can be excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions**: Periods of disability can adjust lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### 3. Maximize Your Earnings and Contributions
Strive to have your annual income meet or exceed the YMPE, which was $68,500 in 2024 and increases over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher paying positions throughout your career, as more earnings mean more CPP contributions and higher future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Contributions**: Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistently high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Since CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, a longer contribution period with higher earnings during those years will lead to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## Estimating Your CPP Benefits
You can use various [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits | methods to estimate your CPP benefits]] for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Distinction from Delaying CPP
While delaying your CPP start age significantly increases your payout, it does not, by itself, boost you from the average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. The factors related to contribution history and earnings discussed above are what move you closer to the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. It's generally advised for most individuals to delay CPP as long as possible, even if not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

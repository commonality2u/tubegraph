In Canada, the landscape of income distribution reveals a significant disparity between top earners and the general population, highlighting trends of economic resilience among the wealthy and a widening [[income_inequality_in_canada | income inequality]]. This article explores the thresholds for entering the top income brackets, the characteristics of these earners, and how their financial situations compare to the average Canadian, particularly in the face of economic challenges.

## Top 10% Earners in Canada

To be considered among the top 10% of individual income earners in Canada as of 2022, an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Within this group, the median income was $147,100, and the average income stood at $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Key Trends and Insights
*   **Rising Entry Bar:** Between 2018 and 2022, the threshold to enter the top 10% rose by 14.3%, from $97,000 to approximately $111,000, reflecting higher overall income levels among Canada's top earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average Gap:** By 2022, the average income in this group was over $50,000 higher than the median of $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This gap indicates how a small number of ultra-high earners significantly influence the average, underscoring growing income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Billionaires like Jim Patterson, with an estimated net worth over $11 billion, notably skew this average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Economic Resilience:** Despite significant events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, top earners continued to experience substantial income growth, suggesting this segment remained relatively insulated from broader economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Growing [[income_inequality_in_canada | Inequality]]:** The faster rise in both median and average incomes within the top 10% compared to national income averages points to a continued widening of [[income_inequality_in_canada | income inequality]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The minimum income to crack the top 10% in Canada ($111,000) is often perceived as lower than many might expect, possibly surprising those who anticipate a threshold of at least $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Top 5% Earners in Canada

To enter Canada's top 5% income bracket, an individual needed to earn at least $147,100 in total income as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The median income for this group was $193,800, and the average income reached $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Key Trends and Insights
*   **Steady Climb in Entry Threshold:** From 2018 to 2022, the minimum income required to join the top 5% increased by 16.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average Gap:** The average income for the top 5% was over $75,000 more than the median, further indicating growing income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **High Tax Contribution:** In 2022, the top 5% of earners paid an average of $87,700 in income taxes, contributing over 41% of all federal and provincial personal income taxes, despite representing only 1 in 20 taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Consistent Membership:** Approximately 76% of top 5% earners in 2022 were also in this group the previous year, and 86% had been in the top 5% at least once in the prior five years, suggesting that many high earners maintain their top positions for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Top 1% Earners in Canada

Reaching the top 1% income level in Canada required earning at least $283,200 in total income in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Within this exclusive group, the median income was $388,200, and the average income was $586,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Key Trends and Insights
*   **Significant Growth:** From 2018 to 2022, the threshold to enter the top 1% increased by 15.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Median income rose by nearly 14.7%, while average incomes surged by 18.3%, outpacing both inflation and broader wage growth in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This phenomenon is often summarized as "The rich truly do get richer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Extreme Income Concentration:** The average income for the top 1% was nearly $200,000 higher than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This substantial gap clearly signifies the concentration of income among the ultra-elite, particularly the top 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Heavy Tax Contributions:** In 2022, the top 1% of earners paid an average of $231,600 in income taxes, contributing over 22% of all federal and provincial income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Exclusivity and Persistence:** Around 69% of top 1% earners in 2022 were also in this group the previous year, and 96% had been in the top 5% at least once in the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While challenging to enter, consistent membership is common once achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Comparison to Average Canadians

A stark contrast exists between the incomes of top earners and the average Canadian. The median income for most Canadians ranges between $35,000 and $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

*   The highest median income for Canadians aged 45 to 54 is $51,500, which is still $60,400 below the top 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The top 5% threshold of $147,100 is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

This comparison vividly illustrates the pronounced [[income_inequality_in_canada | income inequality]] present in Canada. While high income facilitates greater freedom, flexibility, and wealth accumulation, financial success is not solely dependent on high earnings. As exemplified by Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through consistent investing despite a modest salary, it is "what you do with it that builds freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

A common concern arises when a salary increase appears to push an individual into a higher tax bracket, such as moving from $55,000 to $60,000 a year in Canada, which would seemingly jump them from paying 15% to 20.5% federal tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, this concern often stems from a misunderstanding of how progressive tax systems operate.

## The Common Misconception

Many Canadians mistakenly believe that when their income enters a new federal tax bracket, their *entire salary* will be taxed at that new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This misconception can lead them to feel as though they are losing money by earning more, or that the [[impact_of_salary_increase_on_taxes | impact of salary increase on taxes]] is entirely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This is one of the prevalent [[myths_about_higher_tax_brackets | myths about higher tax brackets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## How Progressive Tax Brackets Work

The Canadian tax system, like many others, uses a progressive structure, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is key to [[understanding_tax_brackets | understanding tax brackets]]. For instance, if the federal tax bracket threshold is $57,375:
*   The first $57,375 of your income is still taxed at the lower rate, such as 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   The remainder of your income continues to be taxed at the rates of the lower brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Real-World Example

Consider an individual whose salary increases from $55,000 to $60,000, causing them to enter a new bracket where the marginal rate is 20.5% (above $57,375) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In this scenario:
*   The initial $57,375 of their income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Only the additional $2,625 (the difference between $60,000 and $57,375) is taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This means the individual's average, or effective, tax rate is significantly lower than 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Takeaway

Even if a salary increase places an individual in a higher tax bracket, they will still take home more money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Therefore, individuals should not let [[myths_about_higher_tax_brackets | tax myths]] deter them from pursuing or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

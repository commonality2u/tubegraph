Keeping non-Canadian dividend stocks within a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is identified as a "lesser known wealth killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Many people are unaware that these dividends are subject to foreign withholding taxes, which can reduce returns and cannot be recovered within the TFSA structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This oversight makes it a "truly silent wealth killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Impact of Foreign Withholding Taxes

US dividends, for example, typically face a 15% withholding tax when held in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Example Scenario
Consider an investment of $10,000 in a US stock that pays a 6% annual dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. With the 15% withholding tax, $90 is deducted at the source in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This deduction directly reduces the overall return on the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Optimization Strategies

To optimize a portfolio and avoid these foreign withholding taxes:
*   It is recommended to keep [[top_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend stocks]] or growth-oriented assets in your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Foreign dividend stocks should ideally be held in your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), as the RSP does not have this withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

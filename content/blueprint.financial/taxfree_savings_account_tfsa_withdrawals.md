When managing your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_strategies | Tax-Free Savings Account]] (TFSA), strategic withdrawals can significantly impact your future contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Understanding [[proper_strategies_for_tfsa_withdrawals | proper strategies for TFSA withdrawals]] is key to maximizing your benefits.

## Regaining TFSA Contribution Room

It is important to withdraw funds from your TFSA before December 31st if you need to access them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Any amount withdrawn from your TFSA during the current year will free up an equivalent amount of contribution room for the subsequent year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Waiting Until January
> If you wait until January to make a withdrawal, you will have to wait an additional entire year to regain that contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Delaying this can cost you valuable contribution space, thereby limiting your ability to grow your investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[tax_efficient_strategies_for_withdrawing_from_a_tfsa | tax-efficient strategies for withdrawing from a TFSA]].

### Example

If you need $5,000 for an unexpected expense or a large purchase, withdrawing it before December 31st ensures that you can re-contribute that same $5,000 back into your TFSA in the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

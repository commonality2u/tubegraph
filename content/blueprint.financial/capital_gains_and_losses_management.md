Managing capital gains and losses effectively before year-end can significantly reduce an individual's tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This strategy is crucial for individuals looking to optimize their tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Key Strategies

### [[tax_loss_harvesting_to_minimize_investment_taxes | Tax Loss Harvesting]]
If capital gains have been realized earlier in the year, consider realizing capital losses by selling underperforming investments to offset those gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This strategy, known as [[tax_loss_harvesting_to_minimize_investment_taxes | tax loss harvesting]], reduces taxable income and can help rebalance a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If an individual made $10,000 in capital gains from a property sale, and then sells another property at a $4,000 loss before year-end, their taxable gain drops to $6,000, leading to substantial tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
>
> [!CAUTION]
> Selling decisions should not be based solely on this factor, but it is a valuable consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Deferring Capital Gains
Another strategy involves delaying the sale of profitable investments until the new year (January or later) to defer taxes for another year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Selling a stock for a $15,000 gain in January 2025 pushes the tax payment into 2026, providing extra time to manage cash flow and potentially accumulate more interest or investment returns on the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Complex Scenarios and Considerations

While these examples are simplified, capital gains and losses scenarios can become complex, especially when dealing with:
*   Capital losses that can be carried forward or backward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Income that varies significantly from year to year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### New Capital Gains Inclusion Rules
Individuals must also factor in the new capital gains inclusion rules, which set the inclusion rate at 66.7% for capital gains exceeding $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This is part of [[strategies_for_managing_increased_tax_liabilities | strategies for managing increased tax liabilities]].

### Retiree Considerations
Retirees need to manage capital gains carefully to avoid triggering Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks and other recovery taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Importance for Business Owners
[[Strategies for investors and business owners in response to tax changes | Capital gains and losses planning]] is an area where business owners, in particular, spend considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It is crucial to carefully figure out these calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

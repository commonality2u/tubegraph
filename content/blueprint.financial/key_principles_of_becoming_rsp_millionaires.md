Building a seven-figure Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) is achievable for many Canadians, even those who are not the highest earners or "stock-picking geniuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This success stems from following a set of key principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Secret 1: Make RSP Contributions "Hurt" (In a Good Way)

Unlike average savers, RSP millionaires push themselves to save more, even when it feels uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This approach is likened to a brutal workout: the soreness proves limits were pushed and strength is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Most people save whatever is left after expenses like bills and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. RSP millionaires, however, "flip this on its head" by prioritizing their RSP contributions first, before rent, bills, or anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. They understand that forced saving is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

They achieve this through several strategies:

*   **The "Force Scarcity" Trick**
    *   They increase RSP contributions every time they receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. For example, a 5% raise might prompt a 2-3% increase in RSP contributions, meaning they never truly feel the extra money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Treating RSP Savings Like Rent or Mortgage**
    *   RSP millionaires consider their savings non-negotiable, just like rent or a mortgage payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Rounding Up Savings**
    *   If they plan to save $500 a month, they push it to $550 or $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This small, consistent stretch adds up significantly over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Lifestyle Creep**
    *   While many people upgrade their lifestyle with every raise, RSP millionaires upgrade their savings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

There is a balance to saving intensely; pushing too hard can lead to burnout, while not pushing enough results in minimal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The key is to find a challenging yet sustainable "sweet spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. If saving causes stress, isolation, or prevents enjoying valued activities, it might be "overtraining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

As Warren Buffett stated, "Do not save what is left after spending but spend what is left after saving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This demonstrates the [[importance_of_prioritizing_rsp_contributions | importance of prioritizing RSP contributions]].

## Secret 2: RSP Millionaires Are Stoic Investors

Adopting a [[stoic_investing_approach_for_rsp_growth | stoic investing approach]], which involves controlling what can be controlled and ignoring what cannot, is transformative for investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Many investors are swayed by emotions, reacting impulsively to market ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. RSP millionaires, conversely, follow a rules-based system and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Key practices of stoic investors include:

*   **Ignoring Market Noise**
    *   They disregard constant financial media headlines that predict doom or hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Short-term market fluctuations are considered noise, irrelevant to their long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Not Letting Fear or Greed Control Them**
    *   They avoid chasing "hot stocks" when markets are high and resist panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. They trust their [[the_importance_of_having_a_clear_rrsp_investment_strategy | RSP investment strategy]], knowing consistency outperforms emotional decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Accepting Volatility as Part of the Game**
    *   Market ups and downs are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Instead of fearing drops, stoic investors often view downturns as buying opportunities, continuing to invest with confidence that markets will recover and grow over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

This steady approach, rather than brilliant stock picks, leads to greater wealth over time by avoiding common emotional pitfalls and trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Secret 3: RSP Millionaires Trick Their Future Selves Into Being Rich

Building wealth doesn't always require immense discipline; it can be achieved by "tricking" oneself into saving more without noticing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The secret lies in automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

They do this by:

*   **Setting Up Pre-Authorized RSP Contributions**
    *   Contributions are automatically deducted on payday, preventing opportunities to spend the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Automatically Increasing Contributions Annually**
    *   They set up a small automatic increase (e.g., 1%) annually, allowing savings to grow effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Investing Their RSP Tax Refund**
    *   Instead of spending tax refunds on luxuries, RSP millionaires reinvest them, potentially adding hundreds of thousands to their portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Taking Full Advantage of Free Money**
    *   This includes utilizing employer RSP matching, spousal RSPs to balance taxes in retirement, and claiming deduction carry-forwards when it saves the most tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

This strategy removes human error from the equation, leading to significantly greater wealth by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. These are all part of the [[key_ingredients_for_growing_retirement_savings | key ingredients for growing retirement savings]].

## A Major Mistake Even RSP Millionaires Make: Lack of an Exit Strategy

One common and costly mistake among RSP millionaires is focusing solely on growing their RSP without planning a tax-efficient withdrawal strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. RSPs are tax-deferred, not tax-free; every dollar withdrawn is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Without a plan, individuals risk paying high tax rates or leaving heirs with a substantial tax bill upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This is a crucial element of [[common_mistakes_in_rsp_withdrawal_strategies | RSP withdrawal strategies]].

Solutions to mitigate this mistake include:

*   **Starting Early Withdrawals**
    *   This helps spread taxable income and avoid tax spikes when Registered Income Fund (RIF) withdrawals begin after age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Shifting Funds into a TFSA**
    *   Moving funds into a [[strategies_to_build_a_million_dollar_tfsa | million dollar TFSA]] allows investments to continue growing tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Coordinating RSP Withdrawals with Other Income**
    *   Aligning withdrawals with Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and other income sources helps avoid higher tax brackets and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning with Life Insurance**
    *   Life insurance policies can offset the tax burden, ensuring more wealth remains with the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Most retirees unknowingly lose tens of thousands of dollars in taxes by not properly planning their RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Developing a personalized, tax-efficient withdrawal strategy is crucial for maximizing retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

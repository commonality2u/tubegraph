The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offers hundreds of tax deductions and credits, but many Canadians miss out on money they are entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While it's impossible to cover every tax break, certain tools and strategies can help ensure you claim everything you're entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Free Tax Filing Options

Filing your taxes does not have to cost money, and the right tools can automatically flag missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

*   **Use Free Tax Software**
    For simpler tax returns, utilize free tax software programs like Well Simple Tax and TurboTax Free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. These programs can flag missing credits and deductions and guide you through your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Check CRA My Account**
    You can review past tax returns through your CRA My Account and amend them for a certain period if you missed a [[key_canadian_tax_credits_to_claim_before_april_30th | tax credit]] in previous years, potentially getting money back retroactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Use Autofill**
    Many tax programs offer an autofill feature that pulls your tax slips, such as T4s and RRSP contributions, directly from the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This reduces mistakes and helps ensure you don't forget anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid Missing Tax Breaks

Most people miss tax deductions not because they don't qualify or are unaware, but because they simply forget to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The key is to set up simple systems that do the work for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

*   **Use Receipt Scanning Apps**
    Apps like Expensify or QuickBooks can automatically track receipts by scanning them with your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This eliminates the need to dig through old emails and paper piles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Create a Tax Receipts Email Folder**
    Many tax-related documents arrive via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Create a dedicated folder now, perhaps a separate one for each year, to easily find everything when tax season arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Maintain a Quick Tax Deductions Checklist**
    Before filing each year, run through a simple checklist of common deductions, such as home office expenses, [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | medical expenses]], and [[reducing_taxes_on_investments_in_canada | investment fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. A quick five-minute review can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Keeping this in a spreadsheet and updating it annually with new knowledge can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

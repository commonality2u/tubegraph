Concerns often arise regarding the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and its long-term financial health, with some expressing mistrust that the system might run out of money or that payments won't be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. However, an analysis of the CPP's structure and performance suggests these fears are largely unfounded.

## Financial Sustainability of the CPP

The CPP is considered highly unlikely to face underfunding issues, unlike some private pensions that have experienced problems (e.g., General Motors in 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Several factors contribute to the [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | CPP's sustainability]]:

*   **Growing Contributions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>:
    *   Base CPP contributions are projected to increase from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
    *   Additional CPP contributions are expected to rise from $9.3 billion to $45 billion over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
    *   This indicates a substantial cash flow into the CPP system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Independent Reviews** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>: The CPP undergoes regular independent peer reviews to ensure the actuarial methods and assumptions used are sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Solvency Projections** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>: The latest report determined that the CPP has sufficient funds to be financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years, extending well beyond the current working generation's lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   **Well-Funded Status** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>: Overall, the CPP is considered well-funded, posing a very low risk of underfunding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This provides assurance regarding the [[sustainability_of_cpp_for_future_generations | sustainability of CPP for future generations]].

## Investment Strategies and Management

The [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment strategies and management of CPP]] have contributed to its robust financial standing:

*   **Decent Investment Returns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>: According to the 2023 annual report, the CPP's investment portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. These returns are considered favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation Indexing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>: The CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning payouts increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. This unique feature provides support to retirees during times of high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

Given these factors, the CPP is presented as a secure and well-managed pension plan designed to support retirees over the long term.

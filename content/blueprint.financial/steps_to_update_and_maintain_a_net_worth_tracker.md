Since 2019, [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | tracking net worth]] has transformed personal finance management and helped grow wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. [[using_a_spreadsheet_to_track_net_worth | Tracking net worth]] is comparable to tracking weight loss, where small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Research shows that weight loss participants who tracked their diets regularly saw significant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

[[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is like steering a ship with a compass; without it, you won't know if you're drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Getting Started with the Net Worth Tracker
A simple Google Sheet can make [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Setting up the tracker takes about 10 to 20 minutes, and monthly updates can be done in about 2 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

To begin, you can obtain a free [[using_a_spreadsheet_to_track_net_worth | spreadsheet]] from the provided website link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
1.  **Download and Make a Copy**: After accessing the Google Sheet, go to "File" and "Make a copy" to save it to your own computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It's recommended to name the copy with the year (e.g., "2025 net worth tracker") and start a new tracker at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
2.  **Set Start Month and Goal**: In the "Inputs" section, double-click to set the start month to the beginning of your current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Then, input your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. If you're unsure about your goal, refer to videos on the [[importance_of_reaching_a_100000_net_worth | average net worth in Canada and how your net worth increases after $100,000]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Pro Tip**: Set a recurring monthly reminder (e.g., on the first of each month) to fill out the tracker, as it takes only about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Entering Your Financial Data
The spreadsheet works for individuals or households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
1.  **Current Assets**: List all your current assets, such as checking accounts, savings accounts, GICs, cash accounts, PayPal, prepaid cards, and potentially a car (though you'll need to depreciate it over time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. If you run out of rows, you can increase the Dropbox size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   *Recommendation*: If you have many accounts, consider trimming down to three to five to avoid tracking becoming too cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Assets**: Include registered accounts (like TDSP, TFSA, RSP, LIRA) and property (e.g., a house) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
3.  **Current Liabilities**: Add short-term debts such as credit card balances, revolving lines of credit, and car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
4.  **Long-Term Liabilities**: List long-term debts like student loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Understanding Your Dashboard and Analyzing Data
Once you've entered your data, the dashboard becomes valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. It displays:
*   Your current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   Total assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   Your net worth goal and the shortfall needed to reach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: This visual should ideally show a gradual increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. If you see dips, investigate what happened during those periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For example, a significant drop in long-term assets like an RSP or LIRA could be a red flag, prompting you to re-evaluate your [[investing_strategies_for_increasing_net_worth | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_data | Identifying these issues]] helps to hone in on problems and adjust your approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Assets vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: This graph shows the proportion of your assets (current vs. long-term) compared to your liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: A table tracks the monthly change in your net worth, highlighting drops or increases and their percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This provides [[benefits_of_tracking_financial_trends_and_making_decisions | valuable data]] for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Maintaining the Tracker Annually
After filling out and analyzing data for one year, create a new copy of the spreadsheet for the next year (e.g., 2026, 2027), delete the old data, and start fresh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This allows you to [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | look back and compare]] your performance to previous years, accumulating a balance sheet of your net worth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Alternative Tracking Methods
While a custom [[using_a_spreadsheet_to_track_net_worth | spreadsheet]] offers full control and customizability for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, other tools are available for Canadians to [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | track net worth]]:
*   **Wetha**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview but locks advanced features behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Quicken (formerly Mint)**: Mint was free but has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While it offers robust financial tracking, its cost might not be worth it compared to free alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Pocket Guard**: A budgeting app with a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

[[comparisons_between_free_and_paid_net_worth_tracking_tools | These automated tools come with costs]], whereas a [[using_a_spreadsheet_to_track_net_worth | spreadsheet]] is free and puts you in charge of the tracking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

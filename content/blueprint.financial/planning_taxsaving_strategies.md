The start of a new year is an ideal time to get your finances in shape and save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Proactive planning helps reduce your tax liability, allowing you to keep more of your hard-earned money for your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Prioritize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Tax-advantaged accounts, such as the TFSA, FHSA, and RRSP, offer unmatched tax savings and compounding growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Contributing early in the year gives your investments more time to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

*   **TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)**: Max out your contribution room, which is $7,000 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Tax-free growth makes the TFSA a powerful wealth-building tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. See [[taxfree_savings_account_strategies | TaxFree Savings Account Strategies]] for more.
*   **FHSA (First Home Savings Account)**: Ideal for first-time home buyers, this account offers tax deductions similar to an RRSP and tax-free withdrawals for a home purchase, like a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)**: Review your RRSP contributions for the previous year or plan for the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This is perfect for high-income earners who expect a lower tax bracket in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Be mindful of contribution limits and the March 3rd deadline for previous year contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. See [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burdens | Strategies to minimize RRSP tax burdens]] for more.
*   **RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)**: If you have kids, contribute regularly to maximize government grants, up to $500 annually per child, and benefit from tax-sheltered growth for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Prioritization Rule of Thumb

*   **High-income earners**: Consider prioritizing RRSP contributions for tax breaks, especially if your employer offers matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Moderate or low-income earners**: Focus on the TFSA for its flexibility and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Saving for a home**: Use the FHSA for its unique tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Review Retirement Income and Benefits (for Retirees)

Retirement planning doesn't stop after you stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Managing income sources, taxes, and benefits ensures your savings last and helps sustain your lifestyle without overpaying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

*   **CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security)**:
    *   **Optimize timing**: Delaying CPP to age 70 can increase payments by 42% for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   **Avoid OAS clawbacks**: If your income exceeds the OAS clawback threshold (almost $91,000 in 2024), consider deferring OAS or adjusting income sources to avoid losing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Pension Splitting**: Split eligible pension income with a lower-income spouse to reduce household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For example, transferring $20,000 can lower tax brackets for both partners combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) Withdrawals**: Withdraw strategically to avoid higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. You can transfer excess withdrawals into a TFSA to further shelter growth from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. See [[tax_minimization_strategies_for_rrif | Tax Minimization Strategies for RRIF]] and [[taxefficient_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | Tax-efficient withdrawal strategies for retirement]] for more.
*   **Government Credits and Benefits**: Claim the age credit and pension credit if eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Utilize the home accessibility tax credit for renovations improving home safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning**: Update your wills and beneficiaries to align with your wishes and minimize estate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Stress test your plan for scenarios like market downturns or unexpected medical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Check if your portfolio can handle a 20% drop or an extra $10,000 in annual expenses for healthcare or travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Organize and Prepare for Tax Filing Season

Staying organized simplifies the process, saving you time and stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

*   **Gather Documents**: Collect RRSP slips, donation receipts, T4s, T5s, tuition credits, and receipts for medical, childcare, and home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Keep everything in a digital or physical folder for easy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Review and Update Details**: Update your will and check your insurance coverages, confirming your coverage and updating beneficiaries for life and home insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Get Help**: Use tax software for simple returns or consider hiring a professional for complex needs, such as if you have a corporation, small business, or multiple rental properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] File early if you expect a refund to get your money back faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. If you owe taxes, filing early gives you time to plan payments and avoid late fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

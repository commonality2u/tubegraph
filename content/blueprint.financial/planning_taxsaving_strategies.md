> [!NOTE] Prioritization Rule of Thumb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>

## Strategies for Retirees

Managing income sources, taxes, and benefits in retirement ensures savings last and helps sustain your lifestyle without overpaying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

*   **Optimizing CPP and OAS**
    *   Delaying Canada Pension Plan (CPP) to age 70 increases payments by 42% for the rest of your life, providing more stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks; if income exceeds the clawback threshold (e.g., ~$91,000 for 2024), defer OAS or adjust income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Pension Splitting**
    *   Split eligible pension income with a lower-income spouse to reduce household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Transferring $20,000 can lower tax brackets for both partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **RRIF Withdrawals**
    *   Withdraw strategically from your Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) to avoid higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Transfer excess withdrawals into a TFSA to further shelter growth from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Government Credits and Benefits**
    *   Claim the age credit and pension credit if eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    *   Utilize the Home Accessibility Tax Credit for renovations that improve home safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning**
    *   Update wills and beneficiaries to align with your wishes and minimize estate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Preparing for Tax Season

Starting early to organize for the upcoming tax filing season helps avoid mistakes, claim all deductions and credits, and maximize your refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

1.  **Gather Documents:** Collect RRSP slips, donation receipts, T4s, T5s, tuition credits, and receipts for medical, child care, and home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Keep everything in a digital or physical folder for easy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
2.  **Review and Update Details:** Beyond tax documents, update your will and confirm insurance coverages (life, home) and beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
3.  **Get Help:** Use tax software for simple returns or consider hiring a professional for complex needs like corporations, small businesses, or multiple rental properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

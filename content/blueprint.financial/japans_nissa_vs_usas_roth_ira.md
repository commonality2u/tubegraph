### Flexibility
*   **Japan's Nissa**: Allows tax-free withdrawals at any time with no age restrictions from either account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, withdrawn amounts cannot be recontributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **USA's Roth IRA**: Its rules on early earnings withdrawal are more restrictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. While contributions can be withdrawn tax-free and penalty-free at any time, withdrawing earnings before age 59.5 may incur taxes and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

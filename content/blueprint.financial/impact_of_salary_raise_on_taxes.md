A common misconception exists regarding the [[impact_of_taxes_on_high_income_earners | impact of a salary raise]] on an individual's net income, particularly concerning federal tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Some individuals mistakenly believe that crossing into a higher tax bracket due to a raise will result in taking home less money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. However, this is a myth, especially in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Progressive Tax System in Canada

Canada operates on a [[incremental_taxation_in_canada | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Tiered Taxation:** Only the income earned *above* a specific tax bracket threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Lower Income Retains Lower Rate:** All income earned *below* that threshold continues to be taxed at the previously applicable lower rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider an individual with a current salary of $56,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

*   **Current Tax Bracket:** Their current federal tax bracket is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
*   **Proposed Raise:** They are offered a raise to $60,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
*   **Next Tax Bracket:** The threshold for the next federal tax bracket is $57,375, after which the rate increases to 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

In this scenario:
*   The first $57,375 of their income would still be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the portion of their income *above* $57,375 (i.e., $60,000 - $57,375 = $2,625) would be taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Conclusion: [[Benefits of earning more despite higher taxes | Always Better to Get a Raise]]

Due to the progressive nature of the Canadian tax system, receiving a salary raise always results in an increase in take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The [[benefits_of_higher_income | financial benefits of increased earnings]] are always realized, as only the marginal income is subject to the higher tax rate, not the entire salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

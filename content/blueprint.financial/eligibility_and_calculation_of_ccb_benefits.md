The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17, or approximately $17,235 per year for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Families earning over $135,000 annually may spend even more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. In contrast, families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

The [[canada_child_benefit_program | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) program can provide significant financial support to help cover these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. For lower-income families, the CCB could cover over 50% of the total cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## What is the CCB?

The [[canada_child_benefit_program | Canada Child Benefit]] is a tax-free payment designed to assist families with children under 18 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

Key features of the CCB include:
*   **Indexed to Inflation** The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs, meaning future payments will be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Completely Tax-Free** Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **No Spending Restrictions** Families can use the CCB funds as needed for expenses like food, housing, education, or other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Maximum CCB Payments

If a family qualifies for the maximum CCB, the total payments over 18 years can be substantial:
*   **Children Under 6:** Up to $7,787 per year, totaling $46,722 over 6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **Children Age 6 to 17:** Up to $6,570 per year, totaling $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

Altogether, this adds up to $125,562 per child over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

### Multiple Children Benefits
There is no limit to the number of children for whom you can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>:
*   **One child:** ~$125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Two children:** ~$251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Three children:** ~$376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   A family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## How to Qualify for the CCB

CCB eligibility and payment amounts are based on your **Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. If you are married or in a common-law relationship, your AFNI is calculated by combining your income and your spouse's income, minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families will see reduced payments or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

## CCB Benefit Reduction Based on Income

The CCB amount decreases as your AFNI rises, with reductions happening in two stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>:

1.  **Stage 1 Reduction:** If your AFNI is between $36,525 and $79,800, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Stage 2 Reduction:** If your AFNI is above $79,800 (after the previous $3,000 reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over the $79,800 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### Example: CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six

| Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) | Annual Benefit | Monthly Benefit |
| :-------------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| $35,000 or less                   | $7,777         | $649            |
| $50,000                           | ~$6,840        | ~$570           |
| $100,000                          | ~$2,776        | ~$231           |
| $130,000                          | ~$1,814        | ~$151           |
| Very High Income Levels           | Phased out completely | Phased out completely |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>

As your income increases, the annual and monthly benefit decreases, eventually being phased out completely at very high income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. For exact numbers, especially with multiple children, it is recommended to use the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) CCB calculator or contact the CRA directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## How to Get Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward:
*   **Automatic Calculation:** Once you file your taxes, the CRA automatically calculates your payments; no extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Filing Requirement:** Ensure you and your partner file your taxes every year, and your child is registered with the government for payments to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the climate action incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Deposit:** Set up direct deposit with the CRA for faster payments directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **Payment Dates:** CCB payments are typically issued between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## Important Tips for CCB Recipients

*   **Keep Information Up-to-Date:** If your family's income changes due to job loss, or if there's a life event like marriage, the birth of a new baby, or divorce, update the CRA immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. You may qualify for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.
*   **Shared Custody Arrangements:** Inform the CRA of any changes in shared custody arrangements, as payments are typically split 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Purpose of the CCB

The [[canada_child_benefit_program | Canada Child Benefit]] is a crucial government tool aimed at reducing child poverty and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has significantly impacted poverty reduction, helping to lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. In the same year, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also attempts to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

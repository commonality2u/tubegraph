When planning your [[pension_income_splitting_strategies | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] strategy, it is crucial to consider how your decisions will affect your spouse or common-law partner, particularly regarding pension sharing and survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## CPP Pension Sharing

[[pension_income_splitting | Pension sharing]] involves you and your spouse splitting your CPP income, which can significantly reduce your combined tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. For example, if one spouse receives $1,200 per month in CPP and the other receives very little, you can potentially share the CPP so that each spouse reports approximately $600 in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This strategy can lead to substantial tax savings and make your overall retirement income more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Ignoring this option could result in missed [[tax_implications_of_cpp_benefits | tax savings]] that could enhance your retirement comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. Financial advisors often focus on the impact of [[pension_income_splitting_strategies | spousal CPP pension sharing]] to help partners maximize their benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## CPP Survivor Benefit

The [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | CPP Survivor benefit]] provides ongoing income to your spouse if you pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. The amount your spouse receives is heavily influenced by when you begin receiving your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

Consider the following impact of early CPP withdrawal on survivor benefits:
*   Starting your CPP at age 60 results in a 36% reduction in your monthly benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   If your monthly benefit at age 65 would have been $1,000, starting at age 60 reduces it to $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   Should you pass away, your spouse might receive 60% of this reduced amount, which is approximately $384 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   This is significantly less than the $600 they could have received if you had waited until age 65 to start your CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

Ignoring these factors can mean your spouse has less financial support if you are no longer able to provide for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

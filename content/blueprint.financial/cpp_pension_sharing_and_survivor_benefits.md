When planning your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) strategy, it is crucial to consider how your decisions will impact your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Two key aspects to consider are [[pension_income_splitting | pension sharing]] and the [[cpp_survivor_benefit_amounts_and_calculations | CPP Survivor Benefit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## CPP Pension Sharing

[[Pension income splitting | Pension sharing]] involves you and your spouse splitting your CPP income, which can significantly help with taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

For example:
> If one spouse receives $1,200 per month in CPP and the other receives very little, they can potentially share their CPP so that each reports about $600 in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

This strategy can result in substantial tax savings for both individuals, making your overall retirement income much more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Ignoring the impact of spousal [[pension_income_splitting | pension sharing]] could mean missing out on significant tax savings that could enhance your retirement comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## CPP Survivor Benefit

The [[cpp_survivor_benefit_amounts_and_calculations | CPP Survivor Benefit]] provides ongoing income to your spouse if something happens to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The amount your spouse receives heavily depends on when you start your own CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

For example:
> If you start your CPP at age 60, your monthly benefits are reduced by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If your benefits at age 65 would have been $1,000 per month, starting at 60 would drop it to $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Should you pass away, your spouse might receive 60% of that reduced amount, approximately $384 per month, instead of the $600 they could have received if you had waited until age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Ignoring these factors could lead to your spouse having less financial support in the event of your death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

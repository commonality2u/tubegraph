Many Canadians are potentially "leaving money on the table" with their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, with the average recipient receiving 40% less than the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## CPP Payouts by Age (2024)

The amount of CPP you receive varies significantly based on your age when you begin receiving benefits, and whether you qualify for average or maximum payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Age 65 (Standard Age)**:
    *   Maximum Monthly Amount: $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
    *   Average Monthly Amount: $816.52 (as of April 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
    *   The average amount is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Age 60**:
    *   Maximum Monthly Amount: $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
    *   Average Monthly Amount: $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **Age 70**:
    *   Maximum Monthly Amount: $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   Average Monthly Amount: $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

## Factors Determining CPP Payouts

Several [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | key factors]] contribute to the difference in CPP payouts between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. These [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefits | factors]] are crucial for maximizing your benefits.

### Contributions

Your CPP retirement pension benefits heavily depend on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   To receive the maximum benefit, you typically need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Average Earnings

Your average earnings over your career directly relate to your contributions and affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Consistently high annual earnings (at or above the YMPE) maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Gaps in earnings or years with lower income can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Example: David and Sarah

David and Sarah are both 65 years old and receiving CPP, but with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This illustrates the [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | impact of contribution history and earnings]]:
*   **David**: Started CPP at age 60 and receives an average of $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   He had gaps in employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   David had many years of much lower earnings, reducing overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   His contributions were inconsistent due to career changes and lower-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Sarah**: Started CPP at age 65 and receives the maximum of $1,364 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   She contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   Sarah consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   She ensured her earnings met or exceeded the YMPE every year, maximizing her contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

In summary, the more you earn and contribute from your paycheck to CPP, the higher your eventual CPP benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize CPP Payouts

Here are some [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | ways]] to potentially move from average to maximum CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working and contributing to CPP up to age 70 while receiving benefits, these additional contributions earn you a post-retirement benefit, increasing your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### 2. Dropping Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions to exclude certain periods of low or no earnings from your benefit calculation, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **General Dropout Provision**: Allows you to drop out up to 17% (around 8 years if you contributed for 47 years from age 18 to 65) of your lowest income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This is helpful for early career years with lower income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Dropout**: If you took time off to raise children under age seven, these lower earning years can be excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions**: Periods of disability can adjust lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### 3. Maximize Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career
Aim to have your annual income meet or exceed the YMPE (Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings), which was $68,500 for 2024 and will increase annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Higher contributions lead to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting CPP contributions and future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career, as more earnings mean more CPP contributions and higher future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Contributions**: Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings. Your CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with higher earnings during those years leads to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Estimating Your CPP Benefits

There are several [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits | ways to estimate]] your CPP benefits in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### 1. Rule of Thumb
The CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Previously, it replaced 25% of average work earnings, but with enhancements, it can now replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For example, $40,000 average annual earnings would replace $10,000 annually before the enhancement, and $13,332 annually after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This method is best for a very general estimate due to its complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### 2. Using Calculators
For a more tailored estimate, online calculators are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator**: Comprehensive and provides a detailed estimate, though it can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator**: A quicker and easier option, though less accurate the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Statement of Contributions
Your Statement of Contributions provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at various retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Online**: Access via My Service Canada Account. If you have an account, sign in (e.g., through your bank), then navigate to the CPP OAS section and scroll to contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **By Phone**: You can call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Important Distinctions Regarding CPP Start Age

While delaying your CPP start age significantly increases your payout, it does *not* automatically boost you from an average payout to a maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. The other factors mentioned (contributions, earnings history, dropouts) are what enable you to reach the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

It is a misconception that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The reduction for starting CPP early is generally much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. For most clients, it is often better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

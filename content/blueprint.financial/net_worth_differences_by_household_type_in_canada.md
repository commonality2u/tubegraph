When comparing one-person and multi-person households in Canada, a clear wealth gap is evident, though interesting trends have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.

## The Wealth Gap

By 2024, multi-person households had nearly double the [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | net worth]] of one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The average [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | net worth]] for multi-person households was $1.17 million, compared to $634,000 for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. This significant difference is primarily attributed to multi-person households possessing larger total assets, with $1.4 million compared to $74,000 for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. This often makes sense due to the presence of two income providers and the ability to split expenses within multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Growth Trends

Despite starting with less, one-person households are showing progress in closing the wealth gap in terms of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. From 2020 to 2024, their [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | net worth]] increased by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. In contrast, multi-person households saw a 29.4% increase over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## The Role of Real Estate

[[Impact of real estate on Canadian net worth | Real estate]] plays a major role in the [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | net worth]] of both household types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. It constitutes 55% of the [[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | net worth]] for multi-person households and 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. This data suggests that multi-person households might be more capable of affording property, while one-person households could be getting priced out of the Canadian [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | housing market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

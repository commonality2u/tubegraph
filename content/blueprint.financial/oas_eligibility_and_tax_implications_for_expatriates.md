The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is based on the time an individual has spent in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. It can be collected as early as age 65, with the option to delay it up to age 70 for increased benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## OAS Eligibility for Non-Residents

To receive OAS benefits while living abroad, you must have lived in Canada for approximately 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Even if this [[oas_residency_requirements_for_retirees | 20-year threshold]] is not met, you might still qualify if you:
*   Worked abroad for a Canadian company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   Lived in a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. A list of these countries is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

However, years spent in countries with social security agreements do not count towards the OAS benefit amount itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Benefit Amounts Abroad

If you meet the eligibility requirements, the OAS benefit amount remains the same regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Additional OAS benefits, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Survivor Allowance, require you to reside in Canada to receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Moving abroad will disqualify you from receiving these additional allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Tax Implications of OAS Abroad

[[potential_tax_implications_of_retiring_overseas | Tax implications]] for OAS payments can vary based on your income and the tax treaty between Canada and your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### OAS Clawback

High-income earners may face the OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax, which applies to earnings over a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This clawback still applies abroad unless you move to a country with a tax treaty with Canada that potentially allows you to bypass it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Non-residents typically must file a T1136 form annually to determine any required repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Withholding Tax

Countries without a tax treaty with Canada may impose a [[tax_implications_for_canadian_benefits_abroad | withholding tax]] on OAS payments, typically around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, there will be no withholding tax on your OAS due to the tax treaty between Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. It is crucial to always check the tax treaty details for your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

To collect OAS abroad, you must file an annual tax return reporting your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Pro Tip: OAS Income Management

*   If you are at risk of the OAS clawback, consider managing your income through strategic withdrawals from other retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Consider deferring OAS payments up to age 72 to increase your monthly benefit by 0.6% for each month deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

For specific details and implications related to your situation, it is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, ideally one knowledgeable in both Canadian tax law and the tax laws of your destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

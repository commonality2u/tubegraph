The start of a new year is an ideal time to get your finances in shape and set yourself up for a successful financial year ahead [00:00:00]. This guide outlines seven actionable steps to help save on taxes, grow wealth, and improve your overall financial well-being [00:00:08].

## Compare Your Net Worth

Comparing your [[benefits_of_tracking_net_worth | net worth]] from the beginning of last year to the end is a crucial first step [00:00:18].

### Why It's Important
[[benefits_of_tracking_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is akin to a financial fitness check, revealing whether you are moving closer to your goals or away from them [00:00:32]. Knowing your exact financial standing empowers you to refocus and make informed decisions for the year ahead [00:00:43]. This is often the very first financial task to complete on January 1st [00:00:49].

### How to Do It
[[how_to_track_net_worth_using_a_spreadsheet | Calculating your net worth]] is straightforward:
1.  **List Assets**
    Include cash, investments, real estate, and any other valuable holdings [00:00:58].
2.  **Subtract Liabilities**
    Deduct mortgages, loans, and credit card debt [00:01:04].
3.  **Choose a Tracking Method**
    Use a method that works best for you, such as a budgeting app, a notebook, or a spreadsheet [00:01:10]. Spreadsheets are personally recommended for their flexibility and customization, allowing you to categorize finances, track trends, and gain a deeper understanding of your financial situation [00:01:16]. A free net worth tracker is available for download with a detailed video on its use [00:01:28].

### Motivation
*   **If your net worth grew:** Take a moment to celebrate achievements like paying down debt, increasing savings, or growing investments [00:01:36]. Understand *why* it grew to replicate those successes in the future [00:01:49].
*   **If your net worth didn't grow:** Use this as an opportunity to reflect on what went wrong and make a plan to course correct [00:01:52]. Knowing where you stand is the first step towards improvement [00:01:59].

## Review Your Investments and Performance

Reviewing your previous year's portfolio is essential for refining your investment strategy [00:02:03].

### Why It's Important
Investments are influenced by market conditions, economic trends, and geopolitical events [00:02:11]. Reflecting on both successes and setbacks from the past year is crucial for making better decisions moving forward [00:02:18].

*   **For strong performance:** Consider what drove the success, such as diversification, strong stock picks, or favorable markets [00:02:30].
*   **For losses:** Analyze the causes, such as overexposure to a certain sector, emotional reactions to dips, or insufficient diversification [00:02:36].
Understanding what worked and what didn't prepares you to make more resilient [[tracking_and_managing_investment_performance | investment decisions]] [00:02:49].

### How to Do It
1.  **Review Performance**
    Assess how each investment has performed and examine underperforming sectors to determine if losses stemmed from trends or specific holdings [00:02:54].
2.  **Assess Allocation**
    Check if your portfolio reflects your goals and risk tolerance, ensuring it's not too equity-heavy or overly conservative [00:03:05].
3.  **Spot Cognitive Biases**
    Avoid pitfalls like recency bias (overweighting recent trends) or loss aversion (focusing too much on avoiding losses) [00:03:14].
    *   **Pro Tip:** When reviewing investments, focus on your long-term goals to avoid reacting emotionally to short-term market fluctuations [00:03:26].
4.  **Rebalance Your Portfolio**
    If your portfolio is overweighted in one sector, rebalance it at the beginning of the year [00:03:34].
5.  **Identify Opportunities**
    Explore sectors with long-term growth potential [00:03:43].
6.  **Document Your Strategy**
    Write a clear plan for the upcoming year, including when to rebalance and how to manage volatility to stay focused and disciplined [00:03:48].

## Prioritize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts

Tax-advantaged accounts like TFSAs, FHSAs, and RRSPs offer unmatched tax savings and compounding growth potential [00:03:56].

### Why It's Important
Contributing early in the year gives your investments more time to grow, helping you build [[strategies_for_wealth_optimization | wealth]], save for a home, or prepare for retirement [00:04:08].

### How to Do It
*   **TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)**
    Try to max out your contribution room (e.g., $7,000 for 2025) [00:04:15]. Tax-free growth makes this a powerful [[strategies_for_wealth_optimization | wealth]]-building tool [00:04:21].
*   **FHSA (First Home Savings Account)**
    Ideal for first-time home buyers, offering tax deductions similar to an RRSP and tax-free withdrawals for a home purchase, like a TFSA [00:04:25].
*   **RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)**
    Now is the time to decide if you want to contribute for the previous year or wait for the next [00:04:34]. This is perfect for high-income earners who expect a lower tax bracket in retirement [00:04:41]. Be mindful of contribution limits and the March 3rd deadline for the previous year's contributions [00:04:46].
*   **RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)**
    If you have kids, contribute regularly to maximize government grants (up to $500 annually per child) and tax-sheltered growth for education [00:04:51].

#### Prioritization Pro Tip
*   **High-income earners:** Consider prioritizing RRSP contributions for tax breaks, especially if your employer offers matching contributions [00:05:04].
*   **Moderate or low-income earners:** Focus on the TFSA for its flexibility and tax-free growth [00:05:12].
*   **Saving for a home:** Use the FHSA for its unique tax advantages [00:05:18].
A quick cheat sheet summarizing the pros and cons of these accounts can help you decide which to prioritize based on your goals [00:05:24]. For a deeper dive into maximizing these accounts, specific resources are available [00:05:35].

## Plan Your Tax Saving Strategies

Proactive tax planning helps reduce your tax liability, allowing you to keep more of your hard-earned money for your goals [00:05:53].

### How to Do It
*   **Income Splitting**
    Contribute to a spousal RRSP to lower household taxes, or hire a family member for business work if you are self-employed [00:06:01].
*   **Deductions**
    Claim eligible expenses like medical expenses, charitable contributions, child care costs, moving expenses, and home office expenses if working from home [00:06:11].
*   **Tax Credits**
    Look into credits such as tuition and education credits, the Canada training credit (often overlooked), and the disability tax credit [00:06:27].
    *   **Pro Tip:** Start early to organize receipts, statements, and expenses to maximize deductions and credits stress-free [00:06:38].

## Set Clear Financial Goals and Automate

Clear [[setting_financial_goals_and_monitoring_progress | financial goals]] give your plan purpose and direction, acting as a blueprint to prioritize and stay on track [00:06:52]. Automation ensures consistent progress by removing the need for constant decision-making [00:07:03].

### How to Do It
1.  **Define Your Goals**
    Make your goals specific and measurable for the year [00:07:11]. Examples include:
    *   Pay off $6,000 in credit card debt by year-end [00:07:18].
    *   Save $5,000 for a vacation [00:07:23].
    *   Build a $15,000 emergency fund (6 months of expenses) [00:07:25].
    *   Contribute the full $7,000 TFSA limit [00:07:30].
    *   Contribute a portion to your RRSP [00:07:35].
2.  **Break Goals into Milestones**
    Instead of a large annual goal, break it into smaller, manageable targets. For example, for $12,000 vacation savings, target $1,000 per month or $250 per week [00:07:39]. For $6,000 in debt repayment, aim for $500 monthly or $125 weekly [00:07:49]. Celebrate your wins to stay motivated [00:07:55].
3.  **Automate Contributions**
    *   **Savings:** Set automatic transfers to a high-interest savings account or TFSA [00:07:58].
    *   **Investments:** Use pre-authorized contributions for RRSPs, FHSAs, or other accounts [00:08:03].
    *   **Debt Repayment:** Schedule payments to reduce balances and avoid late fees [00:08:09].
    *   **Pro Tip:** Schedule contributions right after payday to prioritize savings and avoid spending the funds [00:08:14].

## Review Retirement Income and Benefits (for Retirees)

For retirees or those nearing retirement, managing income sources, taxes, and benefits is crucial to ensure savings last and sustain your lifestyle without overpaying taxes [00:08:21].

### How to Do It
*   **Optimize CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) Timing**
    Delaying CPP to age 70 increases payments by 42% for the rest of your life, providing more stable income later [00:08:38]. Avoid OAS clawbacks if income exceeds the threshold (e.g., $91,000 for 2024) by deferring OAS or adjusting income sources [00:08:49].
*   **Pension Splitting**
    Split eligible pension income with a lower-income spouse to reduce household taxes [00:09:03]. Transferring $20,000 can lower tax brackets for both partners combined [00:09:08].
*   **RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) Withdrawals**
    Withdraw strategically to avoid higher tax brackets and transfer excess withdrawals into a TFSA to further shelter growth from taxes [00:09:13].
*   **Government Credits and Benefits**
    Claim the age credit and pension credit if eligible [00:09:27]. Utilize the home accessibility tax credit for renovations improving home safety [00:09:33].
*   **Estate Planning**
    Update your wills and beneficiaries to align with your wishes and minimize estate taxes [00:09:40].
    *   **Pro Tip:** Stress test your plan for scenarios like market downturns or unexpected medical costs (e.g., can your portfolio handle a 20% drop or an extra $10,000 in annual expenses for healthcare or travel?) [00:09:47].

## Organize for the Upcoming Tax Filing Season

Starting early for tax season helps avoid costly mistakes, ensures you claim all deductions and credits, and maximizes your refund [00:10:13].

### Why It's Important
Staying organized simplifies the process, saving you time and stress [00:10:21].

### How to Do It
1.  **Gather Documents**
    Collect RRSP slips, donation receipts, T4s, T5s, tuition credits, and receipts for medical, child care, and home office expenses [00:10:28]. Keep everything in a digital or physical folder for easy access [00:10:38].
2.  **Review and Update Details**
    Update your will and check your insurance coverages, confirming coverage and updating beneficiaries for life, home, and other insurance policies [00:10:46].
3.  **Get Help**
    Use tax software for simple returns or consider hiring a professional for complex needs, such as owning a corporation, a small business, or several rental properties [00:10:59].
    *   **Pro Tip:** File early if you expect a refund to get your money back faster [00:11:12]. If you owe taxes, filing early gives you time to plan payments and avoid late fees [00:11:17].

A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, left the country permanently in 2024, many seeking to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led many to consider [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retiring abroad]] as a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Retiring abroad can allow savings to stretch further, enabling a more comfortable lifestyle than what might be possible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Retirement Challenges in Canada

Living in Canada, particularly in major cities, is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average Canadian retiree]] receives about $1,300 to $1,500 per month from [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount is often insufficient to cover basic expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

In Toronto, for instance, a one-bedroom apartment averages $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With additional costs like $200 for utilities, $400 for groceries, and a $150 transit pass, monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000 for a modest lifestyle without homeownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] combined barely cover a third of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Numbeo estimates that a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, bringing total modest living costs to $3,500-$4,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with $281,000 in net worth after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto and spending about $50,000 a year, with $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, he relies on RRSP and TFSA withdrawals for the remainder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   By age 70, his TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, taking out over $46,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Taxes eat into his funds, with effective tax rates exceeding 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   By age 74, Seth is out of savings, and by 76, his net worth turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

This illustrates how high costs can quickly deplete even a decent nest egg in a city like Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Retiring Abroad: Stretching Your Savings

Moving abroad can significantly alter a retiree's financial outlook by offering a [[cost_of_living_comparisons | lower living cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This allows [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] to cover a larger portion of expenses, potentially allowing savings to grow rather than deplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Top Retirement Destinations for Canadians

Several [[top_countries_for_canadian_retirees | top countries]] offer an appealing blend of affordability, lifestyle, and healthcare for Canadian retirees.

#### Mexico (Cancun)
Mexico is a [[top_countries_for_canadian_retirees | top pick for Canadian retirees]] due to its warm climate, affordability, and proximity to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper than in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom apartment spends around $1,700 CAD per month all-in, totaling about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

**Seth's Outcome in Cancun**: With the same savings but a lower annual cost of $20,000, Seth's portfolio grows significantly:
*   Age 70: $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
*   Age 80: $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   Age 90: Over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>

This demonstrates the "potential power of location" in transforming retirement finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

#### Portugal (Porto)
Portugal offers a European lifestyle with cobblestone streets, seaside sunsets, an [[cost_of_living_comparisons | affordable cost of living]] (especially for Western Europe), great weather, and a slower pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers; Algarve has beach weather nearly all year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent; residents can access the public system, and private care is affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: D7 passive income visa, requiring about €870 per month (approx. $1,400 CAD) in steady income from sources like [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]], pensions, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from Toronto and Montreal to Lisbon and Porto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: Costs fall between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In Porto, rent might be $1,300 per month, with another $1,700 for other expenses, totaling around $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

**Seth's Outcome in Portugal (Porto)**: With $300,000 in savings and $36,000 annual expenses, including $18,000 from CPP and OAS:
*   By age 75, savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   By age 80, savings are just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   By age 84, Seth runs out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

While better than Toronto, Portugal was not enough for Seth's savings to last through retirement without adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Delaying [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] to age 70 and using RRSP withdrawals from 65-69 extends his savings by two years, making them last until age 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Further adjustments, like working longer, trimming spending, or rethinking travel, could make the plan viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

#### Thailand (Chiang Mai)
Thailand is considered one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Offers cooler mountains (Chiang Mai), beaches (Phuket), city energy (Bangkok), or relaxed beach vibes (Hua Hin), with a developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded, with many English-speaking doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Retirement visa for those 50 or older, requiring 800,000 Thai Baht (approx. $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle, including rent, food, and leisure, can range from $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For someone receiving $1,500 from [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] and OAS, this could be a perfect fit, covering most basic needs and allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

#### Paraguay (Asunción)
Paraguay is an emerging destination, particularly appealing for its tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]], OAS, RIFs, or pensions are not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asunción, monthly living expenses can be around $628, with one-bedroom rent at $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month for a good lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Offers relatively easy permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Financial Sweet Spot**: Very low cost, tax-efficient, and simple to settle long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

#### Spain (Alicante)
Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,570, with one-bedroom rent in the city center at $1,300, bringing total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This is comparable to, or slightly cheaper than, parts of Canada or Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The non-lucrative visa requires about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This may require planning like earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Critical Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### Old Age Security (OAS) Rule
A common mistake is losing OAS payments when retiring abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   To qualify for OAS while living in Canada, only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   However, if living outside Canada, 20 years of Canadian residency are required to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   For example, if David, with 15 years of residency, moves to Thailand (which has no agreement), his OAS stops after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Understanding these rules is crucial to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | impact of retiring outside Canada on Canadian benefits]].

### General Planning Advice
*   **Research Costs**: Use resources like Numbeo to compare [[cost_of_living_comparisons | costs]] (rent, food, utilities) in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Beyond Basic Benefits**: Do not rely solely on [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. [[impact_of_inflation_on_canadian_retirees | Inflation]], currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact budgets, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Adaptation**: Life abroad presents challenges such as distance from family, new systems, and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Solid Plan**: A low-cost retirement must be backed by a solid financial plan that considers tax rules and major financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

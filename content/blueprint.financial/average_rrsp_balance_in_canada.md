The average Canadian's Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance experienced a significant drop of over $30,000 in just one year, from 2022 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite this, the decline is not as concerning as it might appear at first glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Overview of Average RRSP Holdings

Recent surveys indicate a 28% decline in average RRSP account values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The national average dropped to $113,000 in 2023, down from approximately $144,000 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This reduction brings RRSP balances closer to historical averages, suggesting that the elevated levels observed in 2021 and 2022 were temporary spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These spikes were likely influenced by pandemic-related savings habits, where people cut expenses and contributed more to their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

While the 2023 decline might seem alarming, it reflects a return to more typical savings levels after the pandemic-induced boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Although Canadians remain focused on their financial futures, the rising cost of living and inflation are making it more challenging to maintain higher contribution levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## RRSP Holdings by Age Group

When examining RRSP holdings, it's crucial to distinguish between median and average data. Median figures offer a more realistic snapshot, as averages can be skewed by high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The latest available median data for RRSPs, RRIFs, and LIRAs from Statistics Canada is from 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Key takeaways from the data include:
*   **Significant Median vs. Average Difference:** For those aged 65 and older, the median balance is $224,000, which is well over double the average of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This disparity highlights how heavily average numbers are influenced by high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Younger Canadians (Under 35):** This group has a median of only $12,500 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This indicates that many young adults have minimal retirement savings, underscoring the importance of starting to save consistently as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Mid-Life Savings Growth (35-54):** While savings improve in this age range, the median of $30,000 to $70,000 is still considerably below what is typically required for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Individuals in this group often juggle mortgages, family expenses, and careers, making substantial retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Nearing Retirement (55-64):** The median savings for this group grow to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, this is generally insufficient for a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While some are better off with an average of over $216,000, many will still need to rely on additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Retirees (65+):** The median savings remain at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This means a significant portion of retirees will heavily depend on government benefits like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) or other income streams, as private savings often won't cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Impact of Economic Family Types on RRSP Contributions

The data on RRSP holdings includes both combined households and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Households typically have higher savings due to shared financial responsibilities and multiple incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Larger households generally contribute more to their RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. For instance:
*   Two-person households lead with 4.2 million households contributing to RRSPs and a median contribution of $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   Single-person households contribute significantly less overall, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

This pattern suggests that dual-income households are often better positioned to prioritize and increase their retirement savings due to more discretionary income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

A 2023 survey provides insights into how different regions across Canada manage their RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Ontario leads with the highest average RRSP balance at $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Atlantic Canada boasted the highest average contribution at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

This indicates sustained engagement with RRSPs across Canada, whether through accumulating larger balances or making consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## RRSP Contributions at Different Stages of Life

Despite inflation and rising costs, Canadians are prioritizing their RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. In 2023, the average contribution increased to $651, up from $575 in 2022, demonstrating a steady focus on retirement savings amidst economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Contributions vary significantly by age:
*   The 55 and above age group contributes a median of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Younger Canadians, specifically the 15 to 24 age group, contribute a median of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This data shows that as Canadians approach retirement, they tend to increase their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Even younger individuals are making notable contributions, reflecting a clear focus on long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Economic Challenges Impacting RRSP Savings

Saving for retirement has faced headwinds recently due to economic challenges:
*   In 2023, a significant 74% of Canadians expressed concerns about how inflation and rising prices were affecting their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   By 2024, 63% of Canadians still reported that current economic conditions were negatively impacting their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, Canadians continue to demonstrate resilience and focus on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Regardless of one's stage in life, regular RRSP contributions are essential for long-term security, even during challenging economic periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

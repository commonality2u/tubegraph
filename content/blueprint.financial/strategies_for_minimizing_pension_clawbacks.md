## Understanding the OAS Pension Recovery Tax (Clawback)

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension recovery tax, commonly known as the "clawback," requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This repayment is triggered if a senior's net income surpasses a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

For the period spanning July 2024 to June 2025, the OAS clawback threshold is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Seniors whose net income exceeds this amount are required to repay 15% of the excess income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Example of OAS Clawback Calculation
If a senior's net income is $100,000, the repayment would be calculated as 15% of the difference between $100,000 and the $90,997 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This results in an approximate repayment of $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_avoid_oas_clawback|Strategies to Minimize the Impact]]

To minimize the impact of the OAS clawback and help keep net income below the threshold, seniors can consider the following [[strategies_to_avoid_oas_clawback|strategies to avoid OAS clawback]]:

*   **Income Splitting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>: This strategy involves distributing income between spouses to lower individual net incomes, potentially keeping both below the clawback threshold.
*   **Utilizing Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>: Income earned within a TFSA, and withdrawals from it, do not count towards net income for tax purposes, making it a valuable tool for [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks|avoiding OAS clawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

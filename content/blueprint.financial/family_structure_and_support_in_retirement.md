A significant factor contributing to early retirement among Chinese Canadians is their family structure and strong intergenerational support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This support system often means individuals are [[challenges_of_retiring_alone | not retiring alone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

## Filial Piety and Shared Living
In Chinese culture, there is a strong emphasis on "filial piety," which is the belief that children should care for their aging parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This cultural value is evident in living arrangements:
*   In 2016, approximately 17% to 18% of Chinese seniors aged 75 and over resided in multigenerational households, which is nearly three times the overall Canadian average of 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Only 13% of Chinese seniors live alone, compared to nearly 30% of Canadian seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Furthermore, a Stats Canada study revealed that 19% of Chinese Canadian adults aged 25 to 64 live with at least one parent, more than double the national average of 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Unlike in many Western cultures, co-living is viewed as a sign of a close-knit, supportive family rather than a lack of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Financial and Practical Benefits
This family structure has clear financial implications for [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | retirement readiness]]:
*   **Shared Expenses**: When adult children and parents live together, expenses are shared, significantly reducing the cost of living per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Retirees do not need to fund their entire lifestyle or pay for rent or mortgage payments on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Financial Assistance**: It is common for adult children in Chinese families to provide financial support to their parents, covering groceries, bills, or offering a monthly allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Mutual Support System**: This dynamic is often a two-way street, with grandparents frequently assisting with childcare, cooking, and other household tasks in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

This robust family safety net can reduce the financial pressure on seniors, often replacing the need for additional income through extended work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This support system enables aging parents to retire knowing they have a strong support network, making early retirement a more feasible and secure option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

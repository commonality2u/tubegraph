After selling the successful finance blog Wealth Awesome, the founder embarked on a new venture: Blueprint Financial, a financial planning company designed to help Canadians optimize their finances and achieve their financial objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:05">[11:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:19">[11:17:19]</a>.

## Vision and Mission
The core belief behind Blueprint Financial is that many individuals have not fully optimized their finances, and the company aims to provide significant value to Canadians and businesses nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:07">[11:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:44">[11:28:44]</a>. The company builds customized [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial plans]] tailored to individual needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:19">[11:17:19]</a>.

## Development and Impact
The transition to this new business aligns with the founder's personal values and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:07">[11:11:07]</a>. The idea for Blueprint Financial emerged after experienced business partners approached the founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:41">[11:32:41]</a>. Prior to launching, the financial planning strategies were personally tested by the founder and then with family members, demonstrating the immense value these plans could offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:51">[11:37:51]</a>.

The implementation of these plans has provided clients with peace of mind and the potential to significantly increase their funds for [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | retirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:08">[11:48:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:30">[11:51:30]</a>. The company helps individuals achieve their [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:06">[11:55:06]</a>.

## Connection to Previous Experience
The founder's past experience as a financial advisor in the corporate world was particularly fulfilling due to the intimate one-on-one connections formed with clients and their families, which provided significant personal satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:16">[12:00:16]</a>. This positive past experience informs the current dedication to personalized financial planning.

## Future Endeavors
In addition to the new company, there's a commitment to continue providing valuable, free personal finance content on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:06">[12:15:06]</a>. This ongoing educational effort is part of a broader journey that has included living in various countries, meeting diverse people, and making an impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:14">[12:27:14]</a>.

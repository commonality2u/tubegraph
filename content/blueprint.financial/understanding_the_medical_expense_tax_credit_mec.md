Navigating medical expenses in Canada, even with its healthcare system, can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to claim some of these costs on their taxes to help keep more money in their pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide will walk you through how the Medical Expense Tax Credit (MEC) works and five common medical expenses you might not realize are eligible for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How the Medical Expense Tax Credit (MEC) Works

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (MEC) enables Canadians to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions | eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Claiming these expenses can be a bit complex, but it's manageable step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Claiming Medical Expenses on Your Tax Return

To claim the MEC, you must enter medical expenses on specific lines of your tax return, depending on who the expense is for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For expenses incurred for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Calculating Your Eligible Claim

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or a set threshold amount, which for 2024 expenses is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The eligible amount is then claimed as a non-refundable credit, which reduces your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

**Example: Jessica's Medical Expense Claim**
> Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($50,000) is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% of income) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
>
> Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Medical Expenses You Can Claim

Here are five common categories of medical expenses that may be tax deductible:

### 1. Prescribed Drugs and Medications

Prescription drugs and medications can be a significant expense, and you may be able to recover some costs at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Eligibility**: Must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Exceptions**: Over-the-counter medications like vitamins and supplements generally do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Medical marijuana is covered, but with conditions: a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase from a licensed producer are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Record Keeping**: Keep all pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

**Example: Sarah's Prescription Costs**
> Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($60,000) is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $3,000 (total expenses) - $1,800 (3% of income) = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
>
> Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### 2. Dental and Vision Care

Dental and vision expenses can quickly accumulate, but many of these costs are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Eligible Services**: Services provided by licensed professionals such as dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Covered Expenses**: Routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Non-Eligible Procedures**: Purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Example: Alex's Dental and Vision Expenses**
> Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
>
> *   3% of his income ($150,000) is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
> *   The set threshold amount for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
> *   The lower of these two amounts is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
> *   Alex's eligible claim is $3,100 (total expenses) - $2,759 (lower threshold) = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
>
> Alex can claim $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip for High Earners
> Higher income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions, for example, getting laser eye surgery and a root canal in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### 3. Medical Travel Expenses

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Distance Requirement**: Applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Additional Claims**: If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Eligible Costs**: Includes public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights), vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance), lodging (hotel, Airbnb), and meals (for extended stays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

**Example: Jennifer's Medical Travel**
> Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Her expenses were $800 for gas and parking and $1,500 for meals and accommodations, totaling $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,300 (total expenses) - $1,650 (3% of income) = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
>
> Jennifer can claim $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip for Accompanied Travel
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Always keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### 4. Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct these premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: This includes plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Non-Eligible Premiums**: Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed**: Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed as long as they cover [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions | eligible expenses]] and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Family Plans**: Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children, which can help [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

**Example: Mark's Private Health Insurance**
> Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
>
> *   3% of his income ($90,000) is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,500 (total premiums) - $2,700 (3% of income) = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
>
> Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### 5. Medical Devices and Equipment

Medical devices and equipment can be costly, but many of these expenses qualify as tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Home Modifications**: In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Prescription Requirement**: Some medical devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify; keep records of both the prescription and receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance costs for devices, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Example: Emily's CPAP Machine**
> Emily earns $65,000 and purchased a CPAP machine for $2,500 for her sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($65,000) is $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (cost of machine) - $1,950 (3% of income) = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
>
> Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. While this amount may seem small, combining it with other medical expenses could increase her total deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Verify Eligibility
> If you are making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it is on the CRA's list of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions | eligible medical devices]] to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

For families, correctly claiming medical expenses can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

**Example: Richard and Pauline's Family Claim**
> Richard and Pauline, a Canadian couple, have two children: Jen (16) and Rob (19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
> Their medical expenses were:
> *   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
> *   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
> *   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
> *   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
> *   Total: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

> *   Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard and Pauline's, making $6,300 eligible for Line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
> *   Rob's expenses (as an adult dependent) must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
>
> Now, let's determine who should claim the $6,300 on Line 33099:
> *   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>
>     *   3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
>     *   Her eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
> *   **Richard**: Earns $42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
>     *   3% of his income ($42,000) is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
>     *   His eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
>
> Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [!TIP] Strategy for Family Claims
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. By organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim, families can [[strategies_for_family_medical_expense_deductions | maximize tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

Understanding the Medical Expense Tax Credit is a key part of [[maximizing_tax_refunds_from_medical_expenses | maximizing tax refunds from medical expenses]] and making smart financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

[[Tracking and analyzing your net worth | Tracking your net worth]] is a fundamental step towards achieving financial goals, much like steering a ship with a compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Without tracking, it's difficult to know if you're drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?

Research indicates that tracking goals significantly increases the likelihood of achieving them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A study at Michigan State University found that tracking makes you 33% more likely to achieve your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Personal experience shows that tracking net worth can completely transform finance management and help grow wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

[[Comparison between tracking net worth and weight loss | Tracking your net worth is similar to tracking weight loss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>; small, consistent actions drive significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. Research published by Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania revealed that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw substantial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>:
*   Those who tracked about 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   Participants who tracked 70% of the time lost 10% of their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>.

The key takeaway is that tracking correlates with success towards goals, even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This principle applies to finances: by [[tracking and analyzing your net worth | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can identify trends, make smarter decisions, and stay on track towards your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Consistency, not perfection, is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## The Net Worth Tracking Spreadsheet

A custom-built spreadsheet offers [[benefits_of_using_a_spreadsheet_to_track_net_worth | full control and high customizability]] for tracking net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. It is completely free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Setting up the spreadsheet takes approximately 10 to 20 minutes, and monthly updates can be done in about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Getting and Setting Up the Spreadsheet

1.  **Download and Make a Copy**: Obtain the free spreadsheet from the provided link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Save a copy to your computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, naming it with the year, e.g., "2025 net worth tracker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. It's recommended to start a new tracker at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Input Start Month**: Go to the "inputs" section and set the start month to the beginning of your current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
3.  **Set Your Net Worth Goal**: Enter your desired net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. If you're unsure what to set, refer to resources on average net worth in Canada and how net worth increases after $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
4.  **Set a Recurring Reminder**: A pro tip for [[setting and automating financial goals | staying committed]] is to set a recurring monthly reminder on the first of each month to update the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### Entering Financial Data

1.  **Current Assets**: List all your current assets, such as:
    *   Checking accounts (e.g., RBC checking account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>
    *   Savings accounts (e.g., Tangerine savings account, CI Direct Savings Account, EQ Bank Savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>

    *   Car (requires depreciation over time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>

    *Recommendation*: If you have too many accounts, consider trimming them down to three to five to simplify tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Assets**: Include registered accounts and property:
    *   Registered accounts (e.g., TDSP, Wealthsimple TFSA, Wealthsimple RSP, Questrade LIRA, EQ Bank FHSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>

    *   Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>

### Analyzing the Dashboard

The dashboard provides a visual overview of your financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>:

*   **Current Net Worth**: Displays your current net worth, total assets, total liabilities, net worth goal, and the shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: Shows a graph of your net worth progress throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. It's important to identify dips and analyze what caused them (e.g., market dips, changes in asset values) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. This helps in re-evaluating strategies like risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.
*   **Assets vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Provides a visual breakdown of your assets versus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Shows the progress for each month, including percentage increases or decreases in net worth throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

After filling out and analyzing the data for each year, create a new copy of the spreadsheet, delete the old data, and fill it in for the next year (e.g., 2026, 2027) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. This allows you to accumulate a balance sheet of your net worth over the years and compare performance annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.

## Alternative Tools for Tracking Net Worth in Canada

While the spreadsheet offers many [[benefits_of_using_a_spreadsheet_to_track_net_worth | benefits]], several [[alternative_tools_for_tracking_net_worth_in_canada | alternative tools are available for Canadians]]:

*   **Wetha**: Connects to financial accounts and provides an automatic overview of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. However, advanced features are behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
*   **Quicken (formerly Mint)**: Mint, once popular and free in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. While it offers robust financial tracking, its cost might not be justified when free alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
*   **Pocket Guard**: A budgeting app that helps monitor spending and manage finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. It has a free version, but premium features require a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

Although tools like Wetha, Quicken, and Pocket Guard offer automation, they come with costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. A spreadsheet, conversely, is free and provides full control over your tracking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Updating a spreadsheet monthly can be a rewarding experience, keeping you engaged with your finances and providing a clear visual overview of your net worth goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

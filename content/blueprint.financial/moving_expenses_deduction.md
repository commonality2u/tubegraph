One of the quickest ways to grow your bank account in Canada is by spending less on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Canadian government refunded over $30 billion to Canadians for returns received from February to June in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. An H&R Block survey indicates that only 18% of Canadians feel they understand the tax credits and benefits they may be entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This suggests significant opportunities for tax refunds and deductions that could save thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article focuses on lesser-known deductions that can result in hundreds or thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

[[moving_expenses_deduction_in_canada | Moving expenses]] are costs incurred when moving to a new home in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. These expenses can be deducted from your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Example: Emma's Moving Expenses Deduction

Consider Emma, who moved 300 kilometers for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Her expenses were:
*   Moving company: $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>
*   Travel expenses: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses: $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   Real estate commission for selling her old home: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

Her total expenses amounted to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
If her income for that year was $70,000, her new taxable income after deducting the [[moving_expenses_deduction_in_canada | moving expenses]] would be:
$70,000 (Income) - $8,000 (Deduction) = $62,000 (New Taxable Income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

This deduction leads to significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Do not miss out on potential tax savings related to moving. The speaker personally missed out on hundreds of dollars in tax savings during their first move by not knowing about this deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

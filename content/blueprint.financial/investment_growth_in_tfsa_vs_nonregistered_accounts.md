Many Canadians, particularly retirees, leave money on the table by not properly managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals and underutilizing their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores a smart strategy that involves transferring excess RSP/RRIF withdrawals into a TFSA to reduce taxes, [[benefits_of_the_tfsa | boost tax-free growth]], and enhance retirement comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Underutilization of TFSA Potential

Despite the significant benefits, there is widespread [[underutilization_of_tfsa_as_an_investment_tool | underutilization of the TFSA]] as an investment tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
Of the 17.77 million Canadians holding a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This means a vast majority are missing out on the incredible tax-free growth potential offered by the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with significant unused TFSA contribution room, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For instance, among TFSA holders aged 60 to 64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The RSP-to-TFSA Strategy

RSPs are excellent for saving during working years, but withdrawals are taxed as income and can push individuals into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. At age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requires conversion of RSPs into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) and mandates minimum withdrawals, regardless of financial need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The strategy involves taking any excess funds withdrawn from RSPs/RRIFs that are not immediately needed for living expenses and contributing them to a TFSA for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can potentially save thousands in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA mandates a $30,000 annual withdrawal, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In Eddie's 30% tax bracket, this results in $9,000 of tax, leaving him with $21,000 after-tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 of this for his living expenses, as his CPP, OAS, and work pensions cover most of his costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead of placing this in a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it into a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Assuming an average annual growth of 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>:

*   **Year 1**: Eddie contributes $10,000, which grows to approximately $10,600 by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Over 10 Years**: Eddie contributes a total of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This grows to approximately $132,000, *all tax-free* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This demonstrates effective [[strategies_for_maximizing_tfsa_growth | TFSA growth strategies]].

#### Comparison with Non-Registered Accounts

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would still grow at 6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. However, with 30% of the gains lost to taxes each year, his effective growth rate would drop to around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Over 10 years, Eddie's non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after accounting for taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This is significantly less than the $132,000 accumulated in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. If the funds were instead placed in a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the final amount would be much lower, potentially around $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   By contributing all excess RRIF income into his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   His TFSA balance grows to $132,000, compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account or about $55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   This approach not only [[maximizing_tfsa_growth | maximizes Eddie's retirement savings]] but also provides flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or let them continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip
> Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a chunk of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Additionally, avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years when you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Does this strategy eliminate RSP taxes on withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals will still be considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your *overall* taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The key is to minimize the tax impact while [[tfsa_investment_strategies | maximizing your overall retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

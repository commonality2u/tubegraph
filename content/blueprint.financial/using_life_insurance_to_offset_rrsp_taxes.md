Upon death, an entire Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance is added to an individual's income for that year and taxed at the highest marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For instance, in Ontario, this can push income into the highest tax bracket of 53% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. One effective method to minimize this significant tax liability is by using permanent life insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## How it Works

To protect an RRSP from a large tax hit upon death, a permanent life insurance policy can be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The tax-free payout from this policy is designed to cover the estate's tax bill, ensuring that loved ones receive the full value of the RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

A "clever twist" to fund this strategy involves using small, gradual RRSP withdrawals to pay the life insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This spreads out the tax burden over time, making the payments manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Example: John and Mary

John (age 72) and Mary (age 70) had a joint RRSP balance of $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Without proper planning, their estate could have faced up to a half-million dollar tax bill solely on their RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

To prevent this, they purchased a joint last-to-die permanent life insurance policy with a minimum death benefit of approximately $632,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This amount was calculated to cover the entire tax bill and leave extra funds for their beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Their policy required annual premiums of $50,000 for the first six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Instead of paying out-of-pocket, they withdrew $50,000 per year from their RRSP to cover these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. By doing this gradually, they spread out the tax burden, avoiding a large lump-sum tax hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. After six years, the policy was fully paid up, requiring no further premium payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

When John and Mary passed away ten years later, the policy had grown to over $777,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This life insurance payout covered their estate's entire RRSP tax bill, plus extra funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Pros

*   **Double Benefit**: The insurance payout is completely tax-free for the beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Reduces Final Tax Hit**: Using RRSP withdrawals to fund premiums reduces the RRSP balance, which in turn lowers the final tax liability at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This effectively trades RRSP income for tax-free growth within the life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Avoids Large Upfront Payments**: By funding premiums through gradual RRSP withdrawals, individuals avoid making large upfront payments from existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Policy Flexibility**: After a set period (e.g., 6 years in the example), the policy can be fully paid up with no further premium payments required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Growth**: The life insurance payout continues to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Cons

*   **Qualification**: Not everyone qualifies for life insurance, especially those with pre-existing health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Tax on Withdrawals**: The annual RRSP withdrawals used for premiums are taxed as income, which can increase tax liability during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning**: This strategy requires careful planning to avoid paying too much tax due to these withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Integrating with Other Strategies

This strategy can be combined with other [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_to_minimize_taxes | RRSP withdrawal strategies to minimize taxes]] for a comprehensive financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. For example, a common blueprint involves combining:
*   **Spousal RRSP contributions**: A higher-earning spouse contributes to a [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_accounts_for_tax_benefits | spousal RRSP]] in the name of their lower-income spouse. The lower-income spouse then makes withdrawals at a lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Gradual RRSP withdrawals (RRIF conversion)**: Individuals begin making gradual RRSP withdrawals (often after converting to a Registered Retirement Income Fund or RRIF) to spread out the tax burden over time, keeping income in a lower bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Life insurance**: Life insurance is then purchased to cover the remaining taxes owed on the primary RRSP holder's balance after they pass away, ensuring the children inherit the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The gradual RRSP withdrawals can be used to cover the life insurance premiums, effectively trading RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

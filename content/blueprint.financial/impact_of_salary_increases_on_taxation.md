A common concern when receiving a salary raise is the potential for increased taxation, particularly if the raise moves an individual into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For example, a raise from $55,000 to $60,000 a year in Canada can shift an individual from a 15% federal tax bracket to a 20.5% bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Understanding the Tax System

Many Canadians mistakenly believe that their entire salary will be taxed at the new, higher marginal rate, leading to a feeling of losing money by [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | earning more]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, this is not how the Canadian [[progressive_tax_system_explained | tax system]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Instead, Canada employs a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] where different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **Tiered Taxation** The first $57,375 of income is still taxed at the original 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Marginal Rate Application** Only the income *above* this threshold is taxed at the higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. In the example of a raise to $60,000, only the additional $2,625 (above $57,375) would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The remainder of the income remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This means that an individual's average or effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax rate they reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Benefits of Earning More

Despite entering a higher tax bracket, individuals will always take home more money with a salary increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Therefore, [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | more income is always better]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is advisable not to let misconceptions about taxes deter pursuing a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

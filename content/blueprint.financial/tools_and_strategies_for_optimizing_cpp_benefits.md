Deciding when to claim Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices, yet over 95% of Canadians begin receiving CPP at or before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For many, however, waiting until age 70 can prove optimal, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This decision should be viewed as part of a retirement puzzle, with pieces like life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams needing to fit together to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payout | maximize your benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## CPP Basics: Understanding Your Options
While over 70% of Canadians claim CPP at age 60 or 65, there are many other options available, including ages 61 to 64 and 66 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Effects of Starting Early (Age 60)
Choosing to start CPP at age 60 reduces your payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction from age 65 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, if Sarah qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, she'd receive only $640 per month at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Effects of Delaying (Age 70)
Delaying CPP until age 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Using Sarah's example, her monthly payments would jump to $1,420 per month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Actuarial Insights and Strategy Takeaways
A detailed 2020 [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | actuarial study]] provides key takeaways to guide your CPP decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Strategy: Starting CPP at 60
This option is best for those who:
*   **Need immediate income or have health concerns** leading to a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Can achieve high investment returns** (6% or more annually) by investing CPP payments, though this comes with higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Are concerned with GIS and OAS clawbacks** as it can help low-income retirees avoid these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Drawbacks:** Permanent 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Strategy: Starting CPP at 65
This default option balances steady payments and avoids needing savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Ideal for:** Retirees with below-average to average life expectancy and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** Provides predictable, inflation-adjusted income without additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs:** Leaves potential income on the table for those living past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Payments equalize with the 70-option around age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Strategy: Delaying CPP to 70
This option provides the highest guaranteed, inflation-adjusted lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Ideal for:** Those with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Longevity protection:** Payments continue for life, securing income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   **High effective return:** Equivalent to around 6-8% annually, making it a strong alternative to many investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Break-even age:** Becomes advantageous after around age 80 when cumulative payments exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Tools for Estimating Life Expectancy
Your predicted life expectancy is a crucial factor in [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Data from Actuarial Reports and Stats Canada
*   The 2020 CPP take-up decision report highlights that 82% of women and 79% of men with healthy lifestyles or a family history of long life are likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Stats Canada data indicates that the older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   [[estimating_your_cpp_benefits | Life expectancy]] in Canada is often longer than commonly realized, especially for those who have already reached middle age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Women tend to live longer than men across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s, making delayed CPP potentially more beneficial for them due to the higher inflation-protected income for a longer retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Online Life Expectancy Calculators
Several online tools can provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass:** Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It's quick (5 minutes) and offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Living to 100:** Based on the New England Centenarian Study, it asks detailed questions about health and habits, providing personalized feedback over 10-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   *Note:* Results from different calculators can vary (e.g., by 4 years), so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but they offer a more tailored outlook than general statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Methods to Refine Life Expectancy Estimates
For a deeper dive into your longevity, consider these options:
*   **Genetic Testing:** Can uncover health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations:** Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing:** Advanced tests that measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings:** Regular checkups for chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) that impact longevity are crucial, ideally starting in your 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Tool: CPP Present Value Calculator
While CPP break-even tables are a good starting point, they don't consider factors like investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A CPP present value calculator incorporates these additional factors for a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### How to Use a CPP Present Value Calculator (e.g., TaxTips.ca)
This tool allows you to input various factors and see the present value of your CPP benefits based on different claiming ages:
1.  **Estimated Monthly Benefit at Age 65:** Input your projected monthly CPP payment at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
2.  **Estimated Annual Indexation of CPP (Inflation Rate):** The default is typically 2.5%, but this can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. High inflation rates can greatly affect the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
3.  **CPP Start Ages:** Select the ages you want to evaluate (e.g., 60, 65, 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
4.  **Calculate PV of Cash Flows Up To and Including Age (Life Expectancy):** Input your estimated life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
5.  **Rate of Return:** Estimate this based on your current or expected retirement portfolio (e.g., 2-6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. A higher rate of return can significantly narrow the gap between different claiming ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Interpreting Results
The calculator will show the present value of choosing CPP at different ages. For instance, with an estimated life expectancy of 86 and a 2% rate of return, delaying to 70 typically shows the highest present value (e.g., $320,000 vs. $222,000 at age 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. However, if you have a shorter life expectancy (e.g., passing at 72), starting at 60 might prove best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Holistic Income Coordination Strategies
[[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | Optimizing CPP]] is a complex puzzle that requires fitting together various pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Comprehensive CPP planning considers additional factors:
*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points:** Analyzing how long you're likely to live and when delaying CPP becomes profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies:** Understanding how CPP income interacts with your overall tax situation to potentially reduce or increase your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation:** Determining if delaying CPP could help avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks, or if an earlier start is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination:** Integrating CPP with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Most often, delaying CPP into the late 60s or 70s shows benefits, but individual circumstances may lead to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

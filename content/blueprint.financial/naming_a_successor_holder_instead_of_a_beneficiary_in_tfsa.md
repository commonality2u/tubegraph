Choosing between a beneficiary and a successor holder for your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a critical decision, especially if you are married or in a common-law relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This choice can significantly impact the tax implications and future growth potential of your TFSA upon your passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Difference: Beneficiary vs. Successor Holder

When you name your spouse or common-law partner as a **successor holder** for your TFSA, they effectively take over the account completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The TFSA remains intact, and all future gains continue to be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Their own TFSA contribution room remains unaffected, allowing them to continue contributing to their personal account while benefiting from the deceased's TFSA as if it were their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

In contrast, if you name your spouse or common-law partner as a **beneficiary**, they inherit the funds, but the TFSA account is effectively closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The inherited funds must be transferred to a non-registered account, meaning any future gains on that money will be subject to tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Crucially, the TFSA contribution room associated with the deceased's account is lost forever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Illustrative Example

Consider Jack, who has a TFSA containing $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1: Jill (spouse) named as Beneficiary**
    *   Upon Jack's death, Jill inherits the $100,000, but the TFSA is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Jill must transfer the funds to a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   Any future gains on the $100,000 become taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
    *   If Jill earns a 5% annual return, she could owe taxes on $5,000 of gains each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Jack's TFSA contribution room is permanently lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Scenario 2: Jill (spouse) named as Successor Holder**
    *   Jill takes over the TFSA completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   The $100,000 remains within the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   All future gains remain tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Jill's own TFSA contribution room is not affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   If Jill earns the same 5% return, she will not owe any taxes on the $5,000 annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Why This Matters

Naming a successor holder ensures the continued tax-free growth of the TFSA assets for your spouse, preserving significant tax benefits and allowing their money to work harder for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

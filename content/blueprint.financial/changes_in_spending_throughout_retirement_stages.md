## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, aged 65 and over, is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The largest portion of expenditures for retirees in Canada goes to shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This includes the cost of their main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

On average, retirees spend:
*   **Shelter**
    *   Approximately $13,814 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Breaks down to $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Equals about 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Despite many retirees owning their homes, they still incur significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities, underscoring the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses even after mortgage payments end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**
    *   About $767 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Averages $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Represents 12.4% of their monthly spending, including both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Transportation**
    *   Generally lower for retirees compared to younger people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Still represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**
    *   Even with free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation in retirement due to increased medical needs as people age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   Accounts for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**
    *   Take up 5.4% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, highlighting the need for continued financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**
    *   Include expenses for maintaining the home, adding up to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Costs Decrease Throughout Life

Data from Statistics Canada provides a clear picture of how household spending evolves with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years old)**
    *   Spending is at its highest peak, averaging $102,646 annually, or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   This rise is driven by higher family needs like larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there is a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years old)**
    *   Spending decreases slightly to about $99,250 annually on average, or $8,270 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   Child care expenses drop during this period, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   There is a greater focus on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years old)**
    *   Spending drops further to $61,800 annually, or $5,150 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   There is less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Three Phases of Spending in Retirement

The average costs in retirement only tell part of the story. Generally, there are three phases of spending in retirement: high, medium, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Example: Alex's Retirement Spending Journey

Let's look at Alex, a Canadian retiree, to highlight how household expenses change through these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

*   **Early Retirement (65-70 years old) - High Spending Phase**
    *   Alex spends about $70,000 annually, or around $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Housing costs are still high but reduced since his mortgage is paid off, though he still manages maintenance and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease greatly with no more daily commutes, but he still maintains his vehicle and occasionally travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   He spends slightly less on food, dining out less and preparing more meals at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Alex enjoys spending on hobbies and travel, taking advantage of his new free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years old) - Medium Spending Phase**
    *   Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   Housing costs stabilize and may slightly decrease, possibly due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs reduce further as he travels even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Food costs remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Spending on travel also reduces slightly, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Later Retirement (After 75 years old) - Low Spending Phase**
    *   Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year, or around $4,166 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs are significantly lower as he rarely travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Healthcare becomes a major expense, including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Travel spending grounds to a halt, and Alex focuses more on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Real-Life Insights from Clients

Observations from clients reveal a wide range of [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | retirement spending patterns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. On average, retirees tend to spend anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000 or $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-end households might spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this can vary significantly; some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For instance, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This reduction is attributed to factors like:
*   Lower housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Transportation becoming less of a need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Overall lifestyle changes as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends can help in [[financial_planning_for_retirees | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] by anticipating changes in spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, ensuring enough savings to cover needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) closely monitors Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) investments that involve non-arm's length transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These transactions occur when an investor, their family members, or someone they are close with has significant control or influence over the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Such dealings trigger serious penalties because they can be used to unfairly shift wealth into a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## What Triggers a Non-Arm's Length Penalty?
Several types of transactions can trigger a non-arm's length penalty:
*   **Investing in a private business** where the TFSA holder or a family member has control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Buying shares in a company** where the TFSA holder or a relative owns more than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Structuring "friendly transactions"** designed to unfairly boost the TFSA balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Penalties
If a TFSA is found to have non-arm's length transactions, the CRA can impose severe penalties:
*   A 50% penalty on the fair market value of the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   A 100% tax on future gains if those shares grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   A TFSA reassessment, which effectively wipes out the tax-free advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

This enforcement mechanism is designed to shut down TFSA loopholes before they can be exploited for significant tax avoidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Example: Bobby Axelrod
Consider a hypothetical scenario involving "Bobby Axelrod" who invests $50,000 worth of shares in his business partner's new startup within his TFSA, expecting massive tax-free gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Because Axelrod has influence over the business and the transaction is not at arm's length, the CRA could:
1.  Impose a 50% penalty on the shares' fair market value, instantly costing him $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
2.  Levy a 100% tax on any future gains. For example, if the shares grow to $500,000, the CRA would claim all of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
3.  Reassess his TFSA, eliminating its tax-free status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Even with legal counsel, such penalties are difficult to fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## How to Avoid Non-Arm's Length Traps
To avoid issues with non-arm's length transactions:
*   **Do not invest in companies** where you or your family members have ownership or control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Be cautious of structuring transactions** that could be perceived as artificial tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **If a deal appears too favorable** within your TFSA, assume the CRA is monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   As a general rule, [[recognizing_prohibited_investments_in_a_tfsa | avoid private company shares]] if you or a family member have control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Tipping in Canada has evolved significantly, moving from a polite gesture to a widespread expectation, often accompanied by increasing pressure on consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is evident in the rising percentages expected and the expanding range of services where tips are solicited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Historical Context and Evolution
The [[history_of_tipping_in_canada | history of tipping in Canada]] traces back to the early 1900s, originating as a master-servant custom from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. By the 1950s, tipping transitioned from an optional gesture to an expectation in settings like restaurants, hotels, and taxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The late 20th century saw tipping percentages "skyrocket," becoming a "math equation" rather than a "modest token of appreciation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## "Tipflation" and Current Trends
[[Impact of technology on tipping culture | Tipping habits in Canada]] have undergone "tipflation," where expectations have risen across various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Tipping Across Professions
Canadians are tipping more frequently across different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:
*   76% tip hairdressers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
*   74% tip bartenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   71% tip food delivery drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

Tipping remains less common for hotel housekeepers (34%) and coffee shop workers (29%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The average tip has increased from 16% to 20% between 2019 and 2023, reflecting a broader pressure to tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Tipping is now a social expectation in many places, especially restaurants and bars, where the norm has risen to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Even services that historically saw little to no tipping, such as coffee shops and fast food, are experiencing a rise in tips due to the convenience of digital payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[Public opinion on tipping culture | Public Opinion on Tipping Culture]]
Canadians hold "mixed feelings" about current tipping practices, with many questioning its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Recent reports indicate growing frustration:
*   64% of Canadians report being asked to tip more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   62% feel pressured to leave higher tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   The number of Canadians tipping 20% or more has doubled from 8% in 2016 to 21% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

"Tip creep" is causing fatigue, with 83% of Canadians feeling that too many places now ask for tips, yet only 13% believe service has improved as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. A majority of Canadians (59%) now prefer a "service included model" with higher wages for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Furthermore, 73% of Canadians believe the current tipping system enables employers to underpay their staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. British Columbia specifically reports the highest levels of "tip creep" (74%) and "tipflation" (73%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

From a worker's perspective, tips are often relied upon for income, but some workers have begun to view tips as a "right" rather than a reward, leading to a "weird dynamic" where interactions might feel forced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## [[Impact of technology on tipping culture | Impact of Technology: The Awkward Tipping Machine]]
Digital tipping screens have become ubiquitous, appearing in coffee shops and food trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. These machines can make tipping uncomfortable by pushing default options of 15%, 20%, or even 30%, with the cashier watching, creating "unnecessary pressure" <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Strategies to Navigate Tipping Machines
To mitigate the pressure from tipping machines:
*   **Carry cash**: Paying with cash bypasses the tipping machine entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Be quick with the button**: Make your choice quickly to reduce perceived pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Set your tipping rule**: Decide your tipping amount before reaching the counter to avoid being swayed by higher options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Remember it's optional**: Not every situation demands a tip, and it's acceptable to skip it if service doesn't merit one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## The Future of Tipping in Canada
Tipping in Canada is in a state of evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. While percentages may continue to rise, "tipping fatigue" is growing, leading consumers to push back against higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Some establishments are adopting "no tipping models" or "service included pricing," paying staff higher wages and incorporating costs into menu prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This approach, similar to [[comparison_of_tipping_practices_around_the_world | European-style service-included pricing]], is gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Despite these changes, tipping remains deeply ingrained in Canadian culture as a way to reward good service, suggesting it will not disappear entirely soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The future will likely see a mix of rising tip expectations, aggressive tipping technology, and continued experimentation with no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The consumer is ultimately seen as holding the power to influence this direction through vocal feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

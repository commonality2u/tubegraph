The proposed Canadian capital gains tax hike, which would increase the inclusion rate from 50% to 66.67%, has faced significant political and legal challenges since its introduction in June 2024. Its implementation has been delayed until January 1, 2026, amid growing opposition and internal party divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Conservative Party Stance

Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has strongly criticized the capital gains tax hike, calling it a "direct attack on investors, business owners, and retirees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. He argues that the tax will:
*   Hurt investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Slow business growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Make Canada less competitive globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

Poilievre has vowed to repeal the tax if the Conservative party is elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Betting markets suggest a high probability (around 95%) of a Conservative victory in the next federal election, set for October 20, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This makes a tax reversal "highly likely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Liberal Party Stance and Internal Divisions

Initially introduced by former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, the capital gains tax change is now facing crumbling support from within the Liberal party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Freeland herself has stated she would scrap the tax if she becomes the Liberal leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Other Liberal leadership candidates are also reportedly distancing themselves from the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Policy Rationale: Arguments For and Against Reversal

### Arguments Against Reversal (Supporting the Tax Hike)
*   **Revenue Generation**: The tax was projected to generate approximately $17 billion over five years, earmarked for government initiatives like housing, dental care, and pharmacare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Reversing it would necessitate finding new revenue sources or cutting spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Tax on the Wealthy**: The Liberal government framed the tax as a means to ensure wealthier Canadians contribute more, aiming to prevent a rollback from being perceived as benefiting "the top 1%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Arguments For Reversal (Opposing the Tax Hike)
*   **Business Growth**: Higher capital gains taxes are argued to discourage investments, slow business exits, and limit reinvestments in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   [[impact_of_us_tariffs_on_canadian_economy_and_tax_policy | US Tariff Threats]]: New tariffs imposed by the US on Canadian imports further pressure the Canadian economy, potentially pushing businesses and investments south of the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **High Business Costs**: Canada already faces high corporate tax rates, regulations, and labor costs. The capital gains tax increase adds another burden, making it harder for companies to grow, sell, or reinvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios and Outcomes

The future of the capital gains tax is influenced by ongoing legal and political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 1. Full Reversal (Best Case Scenario for Opponents)
*   **Judicial Review**: If the Canadian Taxpayers Federation's court case against the government succeeds, the courts could block the CRA from enforcing the higher inclusion rate, effectively reversing the tax hike before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **New Government**: If Pierre Poilievre wins the election and fulfills his promise, the inclusion rate would likely revert to 50% for all taxpayers, benefiting investors, business owners, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### 2. Partial Rollback or Temporary Freeze (Middle Ground)
*   A newly elected Conservative government might lower the inclusion rate but not return it fully to 50%, possibly applying different rules for corporations versus individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   A new Liberal leader distancing themselves from the tax might also reduce the inclusion rate slightly without full restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### 3. No Reversal (Worst Case Scenario for Opponents)
*   **Legal Challenges Fail**: If the courts rule in favor of the government, the CRA would continue collecting at the higher rate, and the inclusion increase would remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Political Shift**: Even if Poilievre wins, economic pressures or competing priorities could lead him not to follow through on his promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Liberal Continuation**: If the Liberal party remains in power, a reversal might be off the table entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Overall Outlook

Given the widespread opposition, multiple legal and political challenges, the new deferral to January 1st, 2026, and the impact of the [[impact_of_us_tariffs_on_canadian_economy_and_tax_policy | Trump tariffs]], there is an estimated 80% chance of a full reversal of the capital gains tax hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. There is a 5% chance of a partial rollback and a 15% chance that the tax remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Recommendations for Investors and Business Owners

Despite the high likelihood of reversal, it is advised to prepare for all scenarios by:
*   **Staying Informed**: Keep track of court rulings, political shifts, and election timelines, as any reversal will likely take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Using Tax-Efficient Strategies**: Employ strategies like maximizing TFSAs, RRSPs, and corporate structures to reduce taxable capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Planning for Multiple Outcomes**: If considering selling a business or real estate, evaluate whether to sell now in case the tax is ultimately implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

While the capital gains tax hike stands on "shaky grounds," nothing is guaranteed. Strategic planning is crucial to protect wealth regardless of the final policy decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

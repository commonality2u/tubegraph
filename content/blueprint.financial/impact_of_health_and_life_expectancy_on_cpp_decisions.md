The decision of when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can be significantly influenced by an individual's health and [[life_expectancy_and_its_impact_on_cpp_timing | life expectancy]]. Delaying CPP can be a strategic choice, especially for those in good health, due to the potential for increased lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[02:40]</a>.

## Increased Life Expectancy

Modern [[impact_of_increased_life_expectancy_on_retirement | life expectancy]] is considerably higher than many people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>. For instance, a 60-year-old in Canada today is expected to live to approximately 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55">[02:55]</a>. This longer lifespan makes the financial implications of starting CPP early more pronounced.

## Consequences of Early CPP Commencement

Starting CPP at age 60 means locking in a lower monthly benefit amount for the rest of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02">[03:02]</a>. If an individual lives longer than the average, this reduced income might prove insufficient to cover their needs as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying CPP

Delaying CPP acts as a hedge against the risk of outliving other [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12">[03:12]</a>. A key feature of CPP is that once it begins, it continues for the remainder of the recipient's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>. Therefore, living well into one's 80s and 90s makes delaying CPP particularly advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23">[03:23]</a>.

Calculations suggest that to earn more from CPP by delaying from age 65 to 70, an individual would need to live to about 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. If one anticipates living past this age, or even well into their 90s, [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_age_60 | delaying CPP]] can be an excellent financial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39">[03:39]</a>.

For small business owners in Canada, understanding and claiming tax write-offs is crucial to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | maximize deductions]] and retain more earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This guide covers fundamental deductions that are easy to understand and implement into daily business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Simple Deductions Every Business Owner Can Claim

Here are 11 straightforward deductions that small businesses can utilize:

### Meals and Entertainment
You can deduct 50% of the cost of meals and entertainment expenses if they are business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This includes client meetings, business lunches, and staff events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The 50% limit is due to the assumption that a portion of these expenses personally benefits the individual, not just the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
> For example, a $200 client dinner allows for a $100 deduction on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Office Expenses
Most businesses incur office costs, making them one of the simplest deductions to claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This category covers:
*   Rent for office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Utilities like water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Office supplies such as pens, paper, and printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

### Home Office Expenses
This deduction is often overlooked, especially by small business owners operating from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. If a portion of your home is used regularly and exclusively for business, you can deduct a part of your home expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Deductible costs include:
*   Mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

To calculate your claim, measure your workspace and divide it by the total square footage of your dwelling to get a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This percentage is then applied to your total home costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
> For instance, if your 2,000 sq ft home has a 200 sq ft office, 10% of your home is used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If your total home expenses for the year are $2,000, you can claim $2,000 as a business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
While there's no strict rule from the CRA on the maximum portion of your home that can be expensed, deducting up to 20-25% typically doesn't raise concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Vehicle Expenses
If you use your vehicle for business purposes, such as visiting clients or picking up supplies, you can deduct a portion of the costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This includes:
*   Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Lease payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Parking and toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance or CCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

To claim, calculate the percentage of your total driving that was for business and apply that to your vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
> For instance, if you spent $10,000 on your vehicle and 5,000 of your 20,000 km driven were for business, 25% ($2,500) of your vehicle expenses are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
Specific rules apply to certain vehicle types; for luxury cars, the maximum claimable cost for depreciation is capped at $36,000 plus sales tax at a 30% CCA rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Travel Expenses
When traveling for business, a variety of associated costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These include:
*   Transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   Meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Incidentals like tips and internet fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
The key is that these expenses must be directly related to your business activities and not for personal trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
> For example, airfare, hotel stays, meals, and taxi fares for a trip to meet a client in another city are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Financial Fees

*   Credit card processing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>
*   Other financial transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>
It is important to track these fees accurately as they can accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Professional Fees

### Software and Online Tools

The creator of Wealth Awesome, a personal finance website, embarked on a "wild adventure" from the site's inception to its eventual sale, aiming to achieve a [[ways_to_make_money_while_living_overseas | digital nomad lifestyle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Launched in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, the initial financial goal was to earn $3,000 per month and attract 30,000 monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These goals were significantly exceeded, with monthly earnings reaching over $20,000 and nearly $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The website generated over $500,000 in total income, excluding the sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Inspiration for the Digital Nomad Lifestyle

The primary motivation for starting the site was the creator's long-held dream of becoming a [[ways_to_make_money_while_living_overseas | digital nomad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A [[ways_to_make_money_while_living_overseas | digital nomad]] is someone with an online income source that provides the freedom to travel globally and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Having grown up in Alberta, worked in Vancouver in finance and energy, the creator felt a desire to see more of the world and be their own boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Backpacking in Asia during their teens and early twenties fostered a love for adventure, culture, and that lifestyle's energy, inspiring the pursuit of a life offering similar freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Additionally, there was a strong desire to create a net positive impact, educate Canadians, and engage in work that provided purpose and joy by helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The journey began with writing for Canadian media and investment publications, including CTV News, on finance-related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This led to a growing following of tens of thousands of readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The idea to start an independent financial education site came from a friend, prompting the creator to assess existing Canadian financial blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Believing they could produce content of equal or higher quality given their education and experience in the Canadian financial industry, and recognizing a market opportunity, the decision was made to launch Wealth Awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### [[income_streams_from_blogging_and_affiliate_marketing | Income Streams and Growth]]

Achieving [[income_streams_from_blogging_and_affiliate_marketing | income from blogging]] was not immediate; the first $50 affiliate commission from Questrade was earned in November 2020, about a year after the site's launch and after writing over 150 articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This initial earning, despite the hundreds of hours invested, validated the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The initial goal of $3,000 per month was met in February 2021, approximately 1.5 years after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Peak earnings reached over $20,000 per month, at one point almost touching $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Income was primarily generated through:
*   **Advertising**: Once a site reaches a certain traffic volume, it can apply for premium ad networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. After reaching 50,000 visitors per month (now lowered to 10,000), the site joined Mediavine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Ad networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille or 1,000 visitors), which for finance content could reach $50 USD per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions**: Money is earned by recommending and referring products, but only those the creator genuinely believed in and personally used, such as Well Simple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Commissions typically ranged from $50 to $100, sometimes up to $150 or $200 per sign-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Site Traffic
The site's traffic started slow, gaining traction only after about 100 articles were written and 11 months into the journey, reaching around 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Growth then accelerated, reaching 50,000 visitors per month by January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. At its peak in 2022, Wealth Awesome saw approximately 250,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. In total, the site accumulated about 5 million visitors, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. A related YouTube channel also grew to almost 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## [[lessons_and_challenges_from_starting_and_selling_a_website | Key Learnings and Challenges]]

The experience of [[building_a_successful_finance_blog | building a successful finance blog]] provided numerous [[lessons_and_challenges_from_starting_and_selling_a_website | lessons and challenges]]:
*   **Technical Skills**: Learning to design and build a website, perform Search Engine Optimization (SEO), write, create graphics, analyze website data, and use various online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Business Skills**: Building an affiliate partner network, monetizing a website, and hiring and managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience**: Previous roles as an analyst (for SEO and outreach data), in business-to-business sales (for promotion), and as a financial advisor (for content creation and audience connection) were invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Personal Growth**: The venture was the creator's first "real business," fostering a sense of being a true entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Mental Toughness**: A crucial lesson was learning to manage the ups and downs of running a business, riding out bad results, and continuing work despite setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The realization that not everything can be controlled, but reactions can, was profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck**: The site's timing, just before COVID-19 lockdowns, when people were spending more time online and interested in personal finance, was a lucky break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Selling Wealth Awesome

The decision to sell Wealth Awesome stemmed from several factors:
*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the creator found it increasingly difficult to remain motivated and excited about producing content, realizing it was time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty about the Future of Blogging**: Concerns about advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates caused stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The sale happened serendipitously when a friend and former colleague, Q, who was building a portfolio of digital assets, inquired about purchasing the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The deal was finalized within a couple of weeks, with the creator expressing satisfaction that the site went to a trusted friend who would bring fresh ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## The Next Chapter: [[postblogging_ventures_in_financial_planning | Financial Planning]]

The creator is now embarking on a new business, a [[postblogging_ventures_in_financial_planning | financial planning]] company called Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This venture aligns with personal values and skills, focusing on building customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The passion stems from the belief that most people haven't optimized their finances and that real value can be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This new path resonates with a past enjoyment of working as a financial advisor, appreciating the intimate one-on-one connections formed with clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

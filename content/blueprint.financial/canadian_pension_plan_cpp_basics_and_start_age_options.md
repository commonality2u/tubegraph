Over 95% of Canadians begin their [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] benefits at or before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, for many individuals, waiting until age 70 can be optimal, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Deciding when to take [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] is one of the most impactful [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | retirement choices]] that can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This decision should be viewed as part of a retirement jigsaw puzzle, where elements like life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams must fit together to maximize [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## CPP Basics and Start Age Options

Most Canadians claim [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] at age 60, with over 70% starting their [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | benefits]] precisely at age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, individuals have options to start at any age between 61 and 64, and 66 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

*   **Starting Early (Age 60)**: Choosing to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] at age 60 reduces monthly payments by 0.6% for each month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. For example, if Sarah qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, she would receive only $640 per month at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70**: Waiting until age 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Using Sarah's example, her monthly payments would jump to $1,420 per month at age 70, offering significantly more income later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Actuarial CPP Report Insights

A detailed 2020 actuarial study on when to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] provides key takeaways, summarizing probabilities, life expectancies, and expected investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   **Starting [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] at 60**:
    *   **Reasons**: This option is best for those who need immediate income or have health concerns that suggest a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   **Drawbacks**: It comes with permanent drawbacks, including a 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65, significantly impacting long-term income, especially for those living beyond age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Investment Returns**: If investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] at 60 allows for investment of payments, potentially leading to a better outcome, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **GIS and OAS Considerations**: Starting at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on their Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS), smoothing income across retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   *Example Scenario (John)*: John, a 60-year-old with health issues and little savings, decides to take [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] early to secure income and avoid GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

*   **Starting [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] at 65**:
    *   **Default Option**: This option strikes a balance, providing steady payments and avoiding the need for savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Ideal Candidates**: It is ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   **Predictable Income**: Standard [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | benefits]] offer reliable, inflation-adjusted income without requiring additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   **Tradeoffs**: This choice leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    *   **Break-Even Analysis**: Payments equalize with the age 70 option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those uncertain about longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   *Example Scenario (Maria)*: Maria, age 65, retires with modest RSP savings and average health. She decides to take [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] now to maintain predictable income without depleting her savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] to 70**:
    *   **Highest Guaranteed Income**: Delaying provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, increasing payments by the maximum amount, and it is inflation-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   **Ideal Candidates**: This option is ideal for those with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   **Longevity Protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   **High Effective Return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to approximately 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   **Break-Even Age**: For most, delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments start to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   *Example Scenario (Susan)*: Susan, age 70, expects to live well into her late 80s or 90s. With sufficient RSP funds, she decides to delay [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]], maximizing her lifetime inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

All these examples highlight the importance of individual life expectancy in the [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | decision of when to take CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The choice largely depends on two key factors: predicted investment returns and life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Estimating Life Expectancy

Estimating how long you will live is a crucial piece of the [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

*   **2020 [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] Take-Up Decision Report**: This report highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Women Tend to Live Longer**: 82% of women are likely to live past age 80, making delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] especially beneficial for secure, inflation-protected income in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   **Longevity Expectations**: If you have a healthy lifestyle or a family history of long life, your odds increase (79% for men, 85% for women), making delayed [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Delaying Often Pays Off**: Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80, suggesting most retirees would [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_age_60 | benefit from waiting]] to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

*   **Stats Canada Life Expectancy Data**:
    *   **Older Age, Longer Expectancy**: The older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. For instance, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   **Longer Than Realized**: Life expectancy in Canada is generally longer than most people realize, exceeding the conventional wisdom of 80 or 82, especially for those already middle-aged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   **Women Benefit More from Delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]]**: Data shows women live longer across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s, making delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] to age 70 potentially provide a higher inflation-protected income for their longer retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   **Men's Considerations**: Men with shorter life expectancies might still find delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] worthwhile but should carefully consider their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Longevity Insurance**: Delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] acts as a safety net, particularly for women who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Planning**: Integrating [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] timing with strategies like RSP withdrawals ensures optimized retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Women might prioritize strategies to extend income into their late 80s or 90s, while men focus on steady income for shorter time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

*   **Online Life Expectancy Calculators**:
    *   Several online calculators provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by longevity regions, quick to complete (approx. 5 minutes), offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, delves deeper into health and habits, more comprehensive (10-20 minutes), provides personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Results from these calculators can differ significantly (e.g., by 4 years), so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but they offer a more tailored outlook than general statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

*   **Methods to Refine Life Expectancy Estimations**:
    *   **Genetic Testing**: Can uncover potential health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   **Lifestyle Evaluations**: Identify modifiable risk factors such as diet, exercise, and stress management to improve overall health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   **Biological Age Testing**: Advanced tests measure aging at a cellular level, offering a more precise estimate of your true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   **Comprehensive Health Screenings**: Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes can significantly impact longevity, and annual screenings are crucial, recommended starting in your 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## CPP Present Value Calculator

While [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] break-even tables are a good starting point, they fall short by not considering factors like the investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. A [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | CPP present value calculator]] incorporates these additional factors to provide a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

The Tax Tips "CPP Retirement Pension Calculator" is a useful, albeit visually simple, tool for this analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

*   **Inputs (Yellow Fields)**:
    *   **Estimated Monthly Benefit at Age 65**: Defaulted to $1,000, but adjustable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   **Estimated Annual Indexation of [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] (Inflation Rate)**: Defaulted to 2.5%, can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
    *   **Start Ages of your [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] to Evaluate**: Defaults to 60, 65, and 70, but other ages (61-64, 66-69) are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
    *   **Start Year**: Can be adjusted (e.g., 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   **Calculate the PV of Cash Flows up to Including Age (Life Expectancy)**: This is where you input your estimated life expectancy based on calculations or family history (e.g., 86 for an average woman in her 50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
    *   **Rate of Return**: Estimate based on your current or expected retirement portfolio (e.g., 2% to 6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

*   **Interpreting Results (Pink/Light Red Fields)**:
    *   The output shows the present value of choosing [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   **Impact of Rate of Return**: A higher rate of return (e.g., 4% or 6%) can significantly reduce the gap in present value between different starting ages, potentially making age 65 or even 60 more competitive with age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   **Impact of Life Expectancy**:
        *   If you live to 100, starting at age 70 is significantly better, providing over $130,000 more in present value compared to starting at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
        *   If you pass away early (e.g., at 72), starting at age 60 would have been the best choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
        *   It's important to remember that most people live longer than they expect once they reach middle age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
    *   **Impact of Inflation Rate**: High inflation rates (e.g., 4%) generally favor delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] to age 70, while very low inflation (e.g., 1%) makes the choices between start ages much closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Inflation rates are almost impossible to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Holistic CPP Planning

Deciding when to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] is a complex puzzle, and failing to piece it together carefully could lead to missing out on tens of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. A comprehensive approach to [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | CPP planning]] considers several additional factors:

*   **Scenarios and Break-Even Points**: Running various scenarios based on your life expectancy and when delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] starts to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
*   **[[tax_implications_of_cpp | Tax Strategies]]**: Analyzing how your [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] income interacts with your overall [[tax_implications_of_cpp | tax situation]], which can significantly reduce or increase your [[tax_implications_of_cpp | tax bill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining whether delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] could help avoid the OAS clawback, or if starting earlier is a better option in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

It is often observed that delaying [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] into the late 60s or 70s provides [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_age_60 | significant benefits]] for clients, though exceptions exist, making scenario planning very valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Tailored planning helps unlock the full potential of your [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] based on your life expectancy, taxes, and retirement goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Strategically managing capital gains and losses before year-end can significantly reduce an individual's tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Key Strategies

### Realizing Capital Losses (Tax-Loss Harvesting)
If capital gains have been realized earlier in the year, consider selling underperforming investments to realize capital losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This strategy, known as [[tax_loss_harvesting_for_investment_gains | tax loss harvesting]], reduces taxable income and helps rebalance a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

*   **Example**: If you made $10,000 in capital gains from a property sale, and then sell another asset at a $4,000 loss before year-end, your taxable gain drops to $6,000, saving you taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Caution**: Investment selling decisions should not be based solely on this factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Deferring Capital Gains
For profitable investments, consider delaying their sale until January or later to defer taxes for another year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This provides extra time to manage cash flow and allows more money to accumulate interest or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

*   **Example**: Selling a stock for a $15,000 gain in January 2025 pushes the tax payment into 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Complex Scenarios and Considerations
While the examples provided are simplified, actual scenarios can be complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, particularly if:

*   Capital losses can be carried forward or backwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Income varies significantly from year to year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   The size of assets is substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### New Capital Gains Inclusion Rules
It is important to factor in the [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | new capital gains inclusion rules]], which set the inclusion rate at 66.7% for capital gains exceeding $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Retiree Considerations
Retirees need to manage capital gains carefully to avoid triggering OAS clawbacks and other recovery taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Many in Canada believe that [[consequences_of_tax_fraud_in_canada | tax fraud]] is a minor offense, often resulting in only a small fine and a warning from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this is incorrect; within a single year, the CRA convicted 23 people for tax fraud, sending 10 of them to jail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The case of Derek Quasney exemplifies the severe penalties for those who attempt to defraud the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## CFO's Greed Leads to Prison

Derek Quasney, formerly the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Lake Louise Ski Resort, had a strong professional reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He held a position of trust, managing the company's finances from Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, between 2015 and 2017, Quasney began misusing the resort's funds for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, a scheme that ultimately led to the loss of his career, his freedom, and over $700,000 in fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Methods of Fraud

Quasney employed three distinct methods to divert company money into his personal accounts:
*   **Company Checks to Personal Accounts** Initially, he signed company checks, but instead of directing them to vendors or business expenses, he wrote them out to his own credit card and bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This method alone allowed him to pocket $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Double-Dipping on Vehicle Allowance** Quasney was already receiving a $700 per month vehicle allowance through his payroll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. He then claimed this allowance again in his expense reports, illegally gaining an additional $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Duplicated Salary Deposits** In a bolder move, Quasney arranged for his salary to be deposited twice: once into one bank account and again into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This particular "trick" alone yielded him an additional $73,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

In total, Quasney misappropriated over $350,000 from his employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His significant mistake was failing to report any of this income to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### The Cost of Getting Caught

When the case proceeded to court, Quasney faced severe repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:
*   **Fraud Conviction (Canmore Court):** He received a 4.5-year prison sentence and a $669,000 fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Tax Evasion Conviction (Calgary Court):** This resulted in an additional one year in jail and a $106,000 fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Overall, Derek Quasney was sentenced to 5.5 years in prison and ordered to pay $775,000 in fines, a sum far exceeding the amount he gained from his scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Additionally, his CPA designation was suspended, his professional reputation was ruined, and he will carry a criminal record for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Lessons from the Quasney Case

Quasney's downfall serves as a cautionary tale for anyone contemplating defrauding the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **All Income is Taxable:** The case highlights that all income, even stolen money, is subject to taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The CRA expects all earnings to be reported, and unreported income can lead to red flags in their system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Corporate Fraud Rarely Goes Unnoticed:** Large financial discrepancies will raise red flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Audits can uncover the truth, even years after the fraud has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Heavy Consequences for Tax Evasion:** A few years of easy money can lead to substantial fines, loss of career, and prison time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Quasney's story is a clear reminder that when it comes to fraud, the "house" (the CRA) will ultimately win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Understanding changes to household taxes and federal income tax brackets in Canada for 2025 can help individuals maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Federal Income Tax Brackets

For 2025, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has adjusted federal [[tax_brackets_in_canada | income tax brackets]] upwards by 2.7% to account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This adjustment is beneficial as it helps prevent [[myths_about_higher_tax_brackets | bracket creep]], a situation where inflation pushes income into higher tax brackets without an actual increase in real income, leading to higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

*   **Example**: An individual earning $80,000 in 2024 would have paid approximately $3,327 in federal tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In 2025, with the adjustments, the same income would result in approximately $3,244 in federal tax, representing savings of about $82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

In 2025, the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) has increased to $16,128 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This amount is reduced for taxpayers with net incomes above approximately $177,000 and is fully phased out for incomes exceeding around $253,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)

The Educational Assistance Payment (EAP) withdrawal limits for RESPs have increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>:
*   **Full-time students**: The EAP withdrawal limit during the first 13 weeks of enrollment increased from $5,000 to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Part-time students**: The limit increased from $2,500 to $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

These adjustments allow students to access more funds earlier in their studies to cover initial expenses like tuition and textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The annual EAP threshold has also been updated slightly from $28,122 to $28,881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## GST Holiday

A temporary freeze on sales taxes for essential goods has been implemented by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This "GST holiday" is active from December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025, and aims to provide short-term financial relief to consumers during the holiday season and into the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Employment Insurance (EI) Premiums

For 2025, the EI premium rate for employees has slightly decreased to $1.64 per $100 of insurable earnings, down from $1.66 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. For a worker earning $50,000 annually, this reduction translates to an approximate annual saving of $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Tax Credits

It is important to review annual updates to tax credits to maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefit**: Increased to almost $8,000 per child under six and about $6,700 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Medical Expense Tax Credit**: The federal threshold has been updated, allowing claims for slightly more medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

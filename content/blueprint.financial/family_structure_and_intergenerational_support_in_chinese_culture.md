[[Family trusts and wealth management | Family structure and intergenerational support]] is a significant factor enabling many [[early_retirement_patterns_among_chinese_canadians | Chinese Canadians]] to [[early_retirement_patterns_among_chinese_canadians | retire]] earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This support system is deeply rooted in [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | Chinese culture]].

## Filial Piety
A strong value in [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | Chinese culture]] is **filial piety**, which is the concept that children should care for their parents as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This value is visibly reflected in how families live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Multigenerational Households
A notable characteristic is the prevalence of multigenerational households:
*   According to the 2016 census, approximately 17% to 18% of Chinese seniors aged over 75 reside in multigenerational households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   This is nearly three times higher than the 6% of Canadian seniors overall who live in such arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   In contrast, only 13% of Chinese seniors live alone, compared to almost 30% of Canadian seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   A Stats Canada study indicated that 19% of [[economic_habits_of_chinese_immigrant_families | Chinese Canadian]] adults aged 25 to 64 live with at least one parent, which is more than double the national average of 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Shared Expenses and Mutual Support
When adult children live with their parents, or vice-versa, expenses are frequently shared, leading to a reduction in the cost of living per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This means individuals do not need to fund their entire lifestyle alone, and rent or mortgage payments are not borne by one individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

It is common for adult children in [[cultural_habits_influencing_financial_planning_and_savings | Chinese families]] to provide financial assistance, whether through covering groceries, bills, or providing a monthly allowance to their parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. In return, grandparents often contribute by assisting with childcare, cooking, and other household tasks, creating a reciprocal support system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Impact on Retirement
This [[Family trusts and wealth management | family dynamic]] facilitates [[early_retirement_patterns_among_chinese_canadians | early retirement]] because aging parents are assured they will not have to manage everything independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Unlike some Western cultures, co-living is viewed not as a lack of independence but as a characteristic of a close-knit, supportive family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This means seniors are not compelled to continue working solely to maintain financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The family safety net often negates the need for more income, playing a significant role in why many [[economic_habits_of_chinese_immigrant_families | Chinese Canadians]] feel secure enough to [[early_retirement_patterns_among_chinese_canadians | retire]] earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Upon death, an individual's entire RRSP balance is added to their income for that year and taxed at the highest marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. For example, a $700,000 RRSP balance could result in a $371,000 tax bill in Ontario, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. To avoid such a significant tax burden, one strategy involves converting an RRSP to a RRIF for structured withdrawals.

## Strategy: Convert to a RRIF for Early Structured Withdrawals

This approach addresses the risk of a large tax hit on an RRSP at death by allowing individuals to manage their taxable income during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

### How it Works
Instead of leaving an RRSP untouched, it can be converted to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:07">[03:42:07]</a>. This allows for scheduled withdrawals over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:12">[03:49:12]</a>. By spreading out the withdrawals, individuals can keep their taxable income in a lower bracket, thereby reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>.

### Example
Consider David, who retires at 65 with $600,000 in his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:16">[03:58:16]</a>. Instead of delaying withdrawals, he converts his RRSP to a RRIF and begins withdrawing $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This amount is added to his annual income but helps keep him in a manageable tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. If David had waited, his RRSP could have grown, potentially pushing his estate into the top tax bracket of 53% upon his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:59">[04:14:59]</a>. By withdrawing gradually through his RRIF, he minimizes taxes year after year and effectively controls his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:07">[04:26:07]</a>.

### Pros
*   **Smoothed Tax Bill:** This strategy smooths out the tax bill over several years, avoiding a large lump-sum tax hit at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:04">[04:34:04]</a>.
*   **Better Tax Planning:** It allows for potentially better tax planning by providing control over annual withdrawal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:07">[04:40:07]</a>.

### Cons
*   **Taxes Still Due:** Taxes are still owed on the withdrawals, even if in smaller amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:07">[04:45:07]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning Required:** It necessitates careful planning to avoid withdrawing too much, which could push an individual into a higher tax bracket or deplete the RRSP too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:01">[04:52:01]</a>.

This [[rrsp_to_rrif_conversion_process | strategy]] is frequently used to [[tax_minimization_strategies_for_rrif_withdrawals | manage RRSP withdrawals effectively]] and save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

## Combination with Other Strategies
The practice of making gradual RRSP withdrawals through a RRIF can also be integrated into broader [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_to_minimize_taxes | tax minimization strategies]]. For instance, these withdrawals can be used to pay for life insurance premiums, which then covers the estate's tax bill on the remaining RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:44">[05:28:44]</a>. This creates a [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_accounts_for_tax_benefits | tax-efficient]] exchange, trading taxable RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

A common blueprint for [[utilizing_tfsa_and_rrsp_for_tax_efficiency | financial planning]] often combines this strategy. For example, one spouse might make gradual RRSP withdrawals from a RRIF to spread out the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:44">[13:02:44]</a>. To further protect the estate, life insurance may be purchased, with the gradual RRSP withdrawals covering the premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:44">[13:08:44]</a>. This method smooths out the tax burden and maximizes the inheritance for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

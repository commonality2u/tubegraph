A high savings rate is a crucial factor in building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Regardless of how much income you earn, if all of it is spent, your net worth will remain at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Saving serves as the fundamental basis of wealth, enabling your [[savings_versus_investing | investments]] to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Defining Savings Rate

Your savings rate is the percentage of your income that you put aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. For example, if you earn $100,000 and save $20,000, your savings rate is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A higher savings rate allows you to invest more, thereby accelerating your [[impact_of_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | compounding]] and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Canadian Average Savings Rate

In Canada, the average savings rate saw an increase, rising to 7.2% in Q2 2024, up from 4.9% the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While this indicates progress, there is still ample opportunity for individuals to save more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. By maintaining a savings rate higher than the national average, you can differentiate yourself and accumulate more capital for [[savings_versus_investing | investment]] and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Overcoming Barriers to Saving

One significant obstacle to increasing savings is "lifestyle inflation," which refers to the tendency to increase spending as your income rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. To counter this, it is advisable to allocate additional income directly to your savings whenever you receive a promotion or a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### The Power of Early and Regular Savings

It is crucial not to delay the start of your saving journey, as beginning sooner provides more time for [[impact_of_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | compounding]] to work in your favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Even modest, [[impact_of_regular_contributions_on_savings_growth | regular savings]] can accumulate significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Saving should be viewed as a habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Consistently setting aside a fixed percentage of your income each month fosters discipline and helps maintain your financial trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This consistent habit forms the bedrock for achieving substantial financial objectives, such as reaching your first $100,000, a key milestone that propels long-term wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

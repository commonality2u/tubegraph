[[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | Avoiding costly mistakes]] is as crucial as selecting the right investments for achieving financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Several common [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | pitfalls]] can hinder investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## Common Investment Pitfalls

### Emotional Investing
Emotional investing can lead to poor decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Allowing fear to drive your investment choices, such as panic selling during market downturns, locks in losses and prevents recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Such behavior often indicates an incorrect risk tolerance, necessitating an adjustment to align with a long-term plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Overconcentration
A common mistake is [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | overconcentrating]] investments, such as putting an entire portfolio into a single stock like Nvidia due to media hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. While this can yield significant returns when successful, the numerous instances where it goes wrong are often unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Examples of the dangers of [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | overconcentration]] can be observed on platforms like the Wall Street Bets subreddit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. For most investors, spreading risk across different asset classes and geographies is a more advisable approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### High Fees
Investors should be cautious of high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. For example, avoid [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] in Canada that have very high Management Expense Ratios (MERs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Segregated funds, which can have annual MERs upwards of 3%, should also be avoided unless specifically needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Opting for low-cost ETFs or index funds can help retain more returns for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Partnering with portfolio managers who directly invest in these low-cost options can also be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Lifestyle Creep
As income increases, resisting the urge to spend all of it and instead saving more for investments is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. This phenomenon is known as "lifestyle creep."

## Key Takeaway
To reach significant financial milestones, such as turning $100,000 into $1 million, focus on smarter savings habits, optimize investments, and employ tax-efficient strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

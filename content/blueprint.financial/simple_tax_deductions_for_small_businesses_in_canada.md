Understanding and claiming [[overlooked_canadian_tax_breaks | tax deductions]] can significantly increase a small business owner's take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This guide outlines 11 straightforward deductions that are easy to understand and quick to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Meals and Entertainment
You can deduct 50% of the cost of meals and entertainment expenses if they are directly business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This includes:
*   Client meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   Business lunches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
*   Staff events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

The 50% limit is due to the assumption that a portion of these expenses benefits you personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
> For instance, a $200 client dinner allows for a $100 deduction on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Office Expenses
Nearly every business incurs office expenses, which are among the easiest deductions to claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This category covers:
*   Rent for office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Utilities (e.g., water, electricity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Office supplies (e.g., pens, paper, printers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

## Home Office Expenses
Often overlooked, home office expenses are particularly relevant for small business owners who use part of their home regularly and exclusively for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Deductible costs include:
*   Mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

To calculate your claim, determine the percentage of your home's total square footage that your workspace occupies and apply this percentage to your total home costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
> For example, if your 2,000 sq ft home has a 200 sq ft office, 10% of your home expenses are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If your total home expenses are $20,000 for the year, you can claim $2,000 as a business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Accountants suggest that deducting up to 20-25% of your home without raising eyebrows is generally acceptable by the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Vehicle Expenses
If you use your vehicle for business activities (e.g., visiting clients, picking up supplies), a portion of the costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These include:
*   Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Lease payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

At the end of the year, calculate the percentage of your total driving that was for business purposes and apply that to your total vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
> For instance, if you spent $10,000 on your vehicle and 5,000 out of 20,000 total kilometers driven were for business, 25% ($2,500) of your vehicle expenses are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Specific rules apply to certain types of vehicles; for luxury cars, the maximum depreciation claim is capped (currently $36,000 plus sales tax at a 30% CCA rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Travel Expenses
When traveling for business, a variety of associated costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These include:

*   Accommodation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Incidentals (e.g., tips, internet fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

These expenses must be directly related to your business activities and not for personal trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
> For example, airfare, hotel stays, meals, and taxi fares for a trip to meet a client in another city are all deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

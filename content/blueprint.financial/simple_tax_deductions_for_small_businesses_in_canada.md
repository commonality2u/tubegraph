For small business owners in Canada, understanding and claiming tax write-offs is essential for [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | maximizing deductions]] and retaining more hard-earned cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]] offers various simple deductions that are easy to understand and quick to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Key Simple Deductions

### Meals and Entertainment
Businesses can deduct 50% of the cost of meals and entertainment expenses if they are business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This includes client meetings, business lunches, and staff events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For instance, a $200 client dinner allows for a $100 deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The 50% limit is due to the assumption that a portion of these expenses benefits the individual personally, not just the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Office Expenses
Most businesses incur office expenses, which are among the easiest deductions to claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This category covers rent for office space, utilities (like water and electricity), and office supplies such as pens, paper, and printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Home Office Expenses
Often missed by small business owners, home office expenses are particularly relevant with the rise of home-based work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. If a portion of a home is used regularly and exclusively for business, a deduction can be claimed for home expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These include mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To calculate the claim, measure the business workspace and divide it by the total square footage of the dwelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This percentage is applied to total home costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, if a 200 sq ft office is in a 2,000 sq ft home (10% business use) and total annual home expenses are $2,000, then $2,000 can be claimed as a business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While the CRA does not specify a maximum portion, accountants suggest deducting up to 20-25% without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Vehicle Expenses
If a vehicle is used for business activities like client visits or picking up supplies, a portion of its costs is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This includes gas, repairs, insurance, lease payments, parking, toll fees, and even depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The deductible percentage is calculated by dividing business kilometers by total kilometers driven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For instance, if $10,000 was spent on a vehicle, and 5,000 out of 20,000 total kilometers were for business, then $2,500 (25%) is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Specific rules apply to certain vehicle types, such as luxury cars, where the maximum depreciable cost is capped at $36,000 plus sales tax at a 30% Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Travel Expenses
Business-related travel costs are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. These include transportation, accommodation, meals, and incidentals like tips and internet fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, airfare, hotel stays, meals, and taxi fares for meeting a client in another city are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The key is that these expenses must be directly related to business activities and not personal trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Financial Fees
Various fees associated with managing business finances are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This covers bank charges, credit card processing fees, and other financial transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Examples include monthly business bank account fees or charges for processing credit card payments or wire transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Professional Fees
Legal, accounting, and consulting fees incurred for business operations are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This includes costs for legal advice, tax preparation, and business consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. For example, hiring a lawyer to draft contracts or an accountant for tax returns are deductible professional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Online Tools and Subscriptions
In the digital age, subscriptions to software, cloud services, and other online tools essential for business are deductible expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Project management software or cloud storage service fees are fully deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Product Cost
This deduction includes the cost of goods sold, raw materials, and inventory purchased for resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. These expenses are directly related to generating revenue and are fully deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For a retail business, the cost of purchasing inventory for resale is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Advertising and Marketing Costs
Most expenses related to promoting a business are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This includes traditional ads (print, TV) and digital marketing efforts (Google ads, social media promotions, email marketing campaigns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Ensure advertising is directly related to business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Employee Salaries and Benefits
If a business has employees, their salaries, wages, and benefits are fully deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This covers base pay, bonuses, commissions, and perks like health insurance and retirement contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Tracking Your Expenses
Careful expense tracking is crucial for tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Technology can simplify this process, with apps designed to track mileage and categorize business expenses automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Recommended software options include QuickBooks, Xero, and FreshBooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

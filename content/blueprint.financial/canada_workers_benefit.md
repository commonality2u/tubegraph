The Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) is a program designed to assist low-income Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Despite its purpose, a significant number of eligible individuals fail to claim it annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Unclaimed Benefits

An estimated 240,000 eligible people do not claim the CWB each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This results in approximately $175 million in unclaimed funds annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Reasons for Unclaimed Benefits

Several factors contribute to eligible Canadians missing out on the CWB:
*   **Complicated Application Process** The application process set forth by the CRA is considered somewhat complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Lack of Awareness** Many individuals are unaware that they qualify for the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Method of Filing** Paper filing exacerbates the issue; only half of paper filers claim the benefit compared to those using tax software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Using tax software can significantly increase the likelihood of claiming the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

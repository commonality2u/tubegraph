2025 marks Canada's first full year under a new capital gains tax structure specifically for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These changes significantly impact how business owners in Canada plan and invest, particularly those aiming to minimize taxes and protect cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Increased Inclusion Rate

The core change is an increase in the capital gains inclusion rate for corporations from 50% to 66.67%, or two-thirds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This means a larger portion of a corporation's capital gains will now be subject to taxation, affecting after-tax profits, investment decisions, and financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Impact and Example

Consider ABC Corp, a Canadian corporation selling an investment property in 2025 for a capital gain of $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Under Old Rules (50% inclusion)**: $100,000 (50% of $200,000) would be included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. With a simplified 10% corporate tax rate, the tax owed would be $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Under 2025 Rules (66.67% inclusion)**: Approximately $133,334 (66.67% of $200,000) is included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. At the same 10% corporate tax rate, the tax owed increases to $13,334 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

This results in an extra tax liability of $3,334 compared to the old rules for this example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This represents a significant increase in tax liabilities, particularly for businesses that rely on capital gains from investments in real estate, securities, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Who is Not Affected?
It is important to note that these capital gains tax changes **do not affect sole proprietors or self-employed individuals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These individuals will continue to be taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate; the changes are strictly for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | Planning Strategies]] for Businesses

To navigate this new inclusion rate, businesses can explore various [[strategies_for_managing_increased_tax_liabilities | strategies for managing increased tax liabilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Two key approaches include:

### 1. Reassessing Investment Portfolios
If a business invests in high-growth assets or stocks that generate substantial capital gains, it will incur more tax under the new rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. A simpler option might be to switch to Canadian stocks that pay dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Dividends often come with tax perks, such as the ability to recover some tax through the "refundable dividend tax on hand" (RDTOH) mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For example, if a business earns $50,000 from high-growth stocks, two-thirds will be taxable, but switching to a dividend-paying Canadian stock could allow for greater tax recovery via RDTOH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Careful planning and analysis are recommended before implementing this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### 2. Contributing to an Individual Pension Plan (IPP)
Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) serve as a tax-efficient retirement planning tool for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Contributions to an IPP are tax-deductible from corporate income, which can help offset taxable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This strategy not only reduces immediate tax liabilities but also builds a solid retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. IPPs are similar to an RSP for a corporation but offer higher limits and greater flexibility for succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Both portfolio reassessment and IPP contributions require careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Related Incentives

While the inclusion rate for corporations has increased, other incentives exist that can benefit business owners:

*   **[[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase | Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)]]**: For 2025, the LCGE limit has increased to $1.25 million (up from approximately $1 million in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This allows individuals to shield a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The LCGE is available to each individual shareholder, meaning multiple shareholders can claim the exemption on their portion of gains, significantly reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. For many business owners, the LCGE remains a more effective tool than the Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive due to its complete exemption for eligible capital gains, especially with multiple shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)**: The CEI reduces the capital gains inclusion rate to one-third (33.33%) on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This incentive is being phased in, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually until it reaches the full $2 million cap by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, a $100,000 taxable capital gain would only include $33,360 in taxable income under the CEI, compared to $66,670 without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. However, the CEI does not address investment income taxation, which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Strategically allocating gains across shareholders can maximize the benefits of the LCGE without solely relying on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Combining the CEI and LCGE can be a powerful, albeit nuanced, tax planning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

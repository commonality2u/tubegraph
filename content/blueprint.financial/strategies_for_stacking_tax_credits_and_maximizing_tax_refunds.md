The tax deadline is April 30th, and failing to claim eligible credits can result in missed savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canada offers numerous tax credits, and many individuals overlook significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) is automatically applied, most other credits require manual claiming on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The key to maximizing your [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | savings]] is not just knowing individual credits, but understanding how to stack them for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Stacking Multiple Credits for Bigger Refunds

Many Canadians don't realize how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Saving Combo

This strategy is often used for clients seeking [[strategies_to_minimize_taxes_with_a_rrif | tax savings in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

*   **Pension Income Amount**: Up to $2,000 per person for eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, which can reduce taxes for those 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. It's worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Credit**: Provides an additional tax break for those 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

**Example**: John and Linda are both retired. John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Since both are over 65, they can each claim the Pension Income Amount to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. John also qualifies for the Age Amount Credit, adding to his tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

**Stack Savings**: Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

**Bonus Tip**: [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | Pension income splitting]] can save even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo

Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

*   **Canada Child Benefits (CCB)**: Tax-free monthly payments for parents with kids under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Claimable for daycare, babysitting, or after-school program costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)**: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

**Example**: Sarah and Mike have two young children. Their children are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   **Canada Child Benefit**: They receive tax-free monthly payments to help with child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: Since one child has a disability, they receive an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

**Stack Savings**: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

**Bonus Tip**: Families can also [[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | split income]] by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Average Retirement Spending in Canada

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees (aged 65 and over) was $61,800 annually, or approximately $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Key Spending Categories

*   **Shelter**: The largest portion of spending, averaging about $13,814 annually or $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, accounting for 22.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Even with paid-off mortgages, retirees face significant costs for maintenance, property taxes, and utilities, highlighting the importance of budgeting for these ongoing expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**: A significant category, with retirees spending approximately $7,667 annually or $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, which is 12.4% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Generally lower for retirees than younger individuals, but still accounts for 8.8% of the monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Despite free healthcare in Canada, retirees allocate a higher portion to health-related expenses (5.6%) due to increased medical needs as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**: Represents 5.4% of monthly spending, emphasizing the continued need for [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**: Expenses for maintaining the home contribute 5.3% to monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Changes in Spending Throughout Life

Household spending patterns evolve significantly across different life stages, with a general decrease as individuals move from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54)**: Spending peaks during this period, averaging about $110,646 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is driven by greater family needs, larger homes, increased food consumption, education costs for children, rising healthcare expenses, and a focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64)**: Spending begins to decrease slightly to about $99,250 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly. There's also a greater emphasis on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+)**: Spending reduces further to $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare. Transportation costs decline as work-related travel diminishes, and there is less spending on luxuries, with more emphasis on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## [[changes_in_spending_throughout_retirement_stages | Stages of Retirement Spending]]

Retirement spending typically follows three phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Early Retirement (Ages 65-70) - High Spending Phase

In the initial years of retirement, spending tends to be higher. For instance, a retiree might spend around $70,000 annually or about $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

*   **Housing**: Costs are still high, though reduced if the mortgage is paid off, but maintenance and property taxes remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Decreases significantly due to the absence of daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel costs persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Begins to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Food**: Slightly less is spent on dining out, with more meals prepared at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Spending**: Higher spending on hobbies and travel to enjoy new-found free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Mid-Retirement (Ages 70-75) - Medium Spending Phase

As retirees move into their mid-retirement years, annual spending generally decreases to around $60,000, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Housing**: Costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Further reduces as travel becomes less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Continues to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Food**: Costs remain stable or decrease further due to changing dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Spending**: Spending on travel reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Later Retirement (Age 75+) - Low Spending Phase

In later retirement years, annual spending typically drops to about $50,000 per year, or around $4,167 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

*   **Housing**: Remains stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Significantly lower as travel becomes rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Becomes a major expense, potentially including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Food**: Relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Spending**: Travel spending halts, with focus shifting to community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Real-Life [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | Retirement Spending Patterns]]

Financial advisors observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   **Average Range**: Retirees commonly spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Higher End**: Households on the higher end might spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Variability**: Spending can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This reduction is attributed to factors like lowering housing costs (e.g., paid-off mortgages), reduced transportation needs, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, their spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends is crucial for [[financial_planning_for_retirees | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] and anticipating changes in spending habits to ensure sufficient savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

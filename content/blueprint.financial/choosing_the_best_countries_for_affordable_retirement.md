A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, permanently left the country in 2024, many seeking to escape high costs and taxes, and the fear of outliving their [[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores why some Canadians are choosing to [[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | retire abroad]] and how they can do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, covering top countries that offer lower living costs, good healthcare, and desirable lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Canadian Retirement Challenge

Living in Canada, particularly in major cities, is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount may not be sufficient for 2025 living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For example, in Toronto:
*   Average rent for a one-bedroom apartment: $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Utilities: $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Groceries: $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Transit pass: $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   Total modest monthly living cost without home ownership: over $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

CPP and OAS combined barely cover a third of these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Numbeo.com estimates a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, leading to a total of $3,500 to $4,000 per month with a $2,000 one-bedroom rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This high cost causes many Canadians to delay retirement or seek options abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Seth's Toronto Scenario

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto, he spends approximately $50,000 per year, with $18,000 annually covered by CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The remainder comes from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   By age 70: His TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72: He relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, exceeding $46,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Effective tax rates creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   By age 74: He is out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   By age 76: His net worth turns negative, a nightmare scenario for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Seth's situation highlights how a decent nest egg can quickly unravel in a high-cost city like Toronto due to high expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Top Countries for Affordable Retirement

For many, [[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | retiring abroad]] offers a solution where money stretches further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Using Numbeo can provide a rough idea of living costs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Mexico

Mexico is a top choice for Canadian retirees seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper (e.g., 20% of Canadian prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Visas**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring approximately $103,000 Canadian in savings, depending on the consulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities make visiting family easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, and public healthcare is generally not available for foreigners, requiring private insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Some Spanish language skills are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

#### Seth's Cancun Scenario
If Seth, with his $300,000 in savings, retired in Cancun, where a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 Canadian per month all-in ($20,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   CPP and OAS would cover most expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   He would make only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   His portfolio would grow: $387,000 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, $586,000 at age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, and over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
This demonstrates the potential power of location in [[strategies_for_optimizing_retirement_income_for_immigrants | optimizing retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal

Portugal offers a laid-back European lifestyle with old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and a relatively affordable cost of living for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers, with beach weather nearly year-round in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Porto and Lisbon are cooler and breezier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent healthcare; residents can access the public system, and private care is affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visas**: The D7 passive income visa is available for those with steady income from sources like CPP, pensions, or investments, requiring about â‚¬870 per month ($1,400 Canadian) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from Lisbon and Porto to Toronto and Montreal are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Generally falls between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### Seth's Porto Scenario
In Porto, a more upscale choice than Cancun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>:
*   Rent: around $1,300 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Other expenses: $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Total monthly expenses: around $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, similar to lower-end Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
With annual spending of $36,000, and $18,000 from CPP/OAS, Seth draws down his TFSA and then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   By age 75: Savings drop to around $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   By age 80: Savings are just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   By age 84: He is out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

While Portugal offers a better runway than Toronto, it still wasn't enough to sustain Seth's retirement to age 90, which is recommended for [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | retirement planning]] given increasing life expectancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

#### Small Adjustments, Big Impact
If Seth delays CPP to age 70 and draws from his RRSP from ages 65-69, he can lower early taxes, maximize CPP growth, and distribute withdrawals more evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This single adjustment extends his savings by two years, meaning he would run out of money around age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Further [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | financial planning]] adjustments, such as working a bit longer, trimming spending, or earning from a hobby, could make the plan more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Thailand

Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Options include the cooler mountains of Chiang Mai, the beaches of Phuket, the energy of Bangkok, or the relaxed vibe of Huah Hin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded, with many English-speaking doctors in private hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visas**: A retirement visa requires applicants to be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (approx. $33,000 Canadian) in a Thai bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For someone like Seth, receiving $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this could cover most basic needs and allow savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay

Paraguay is an emerging destination, particularly appealing for its tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Tax System**: It operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income (like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions) is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asuncion, living expenses average $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, totaling just over $1,200 per month for a good lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Visas**: Permanent residency visas are obtainable with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
Paraguay offers a low-cost, tax-efficient, and simple long-term settlement option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain

Spain provides a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent healthcare, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,507, with a one-bedroom rent in the city center at about $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Total monthly expenses range from $2,400 to $2,500, similar to or slightly cheaper than parts of Canada and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Visas**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, requiring about $40,000 to $45,000 Canadian per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This is a higher bar, but achievable with proactive [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | planning]] (e.g., earlier RRSP withdrawals or delayed CPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
Spain offers a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Critical Financial Planning Considerations for Retiring Abroad

> [!CAUTION] OAS Payments Abroad
> Many Canadians risk losing Old Age Security (OAS) payments if they retire abroad without meeting a key rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
> *   If you apply while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
> *   If living outside Canada, you need 20 years of residency to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
> *   If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
>
> **Example**: David, 67, with 15 years of Canadian residency, starts collecting OAS in Calgary. When he retires to Thailand (which has no social security agreement with Canada), his OAS stops after 6 months because he didn't meet the 20-year mark for receiving benefits abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It's crucial to know the rules before moving to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### General Advice for [[Retirement planning for Canadian expats | Canadian Expats]]
*   **Research Costs**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs (rent, food, utilities) for your target country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Diversify Income**: Don't rely solely on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **Understand Challenges**: Life abroad isn't for everyone. Distance from family, new systems, and language barriers can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Solid Plan**: An [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | affordable country]] can be amazing, but only if backed by a solid [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | financial plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Location influences tax rules and significant financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

If you are serious about [[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | retiring abroad]], consider mapping out costs, taxes, and potential "what-ifs" to ensure your plan is sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Services like "Exit Canada" offer consultations to help build a [[financial_planning_for_international_retirement | retirement blueprint]] anywhere in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

When considering the optimal time to begin collecting Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, an individual's health and life expectancy play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Delaying CPP collection, particularly past age 60, can be a strategic choice if you anticipate a longer lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Why Health Matters for CPP Timing

### Increased Life Expectancy
Life expectancy in Canada is higher than many people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. A 60-year-old in Canada today is expected to live to approximately 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This extended lifespan makes [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying CPP]] more advantageous.

### Long-Term Financial Security
If you start CPP at age 60, you lock in a permanently lower monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For those who live longer than average, this reduced income might not be sufficient to cover needs in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. By delaying CPP, you [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | hedge against the risk of outliving your other retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### CPP is a Lifetime Benefit
The CPP benefit, once started, lasts for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means that if you live well into your 80s or 90s, the [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_60 | decision to delay CPP]] and receive higher payments becomes even more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Breakeven Point Considerations
Calculations show that the point at which you earn more from CPP by [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying collection]] from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If you anticipate living past this age, or even well into your 90s, delaying your CPP can be an excellent financial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

While delaying CPP offers significant advantages for those in good health, it's crucial to evaluate your [[factors_influencing_cpp_start_age_decision | personal financial situation]] and current health needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. If immediate income is necessary, starting CPP at age 60 might be the right choice despite the reduced amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Professional financial guidance can help optimize your [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | CPP and other retirement benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

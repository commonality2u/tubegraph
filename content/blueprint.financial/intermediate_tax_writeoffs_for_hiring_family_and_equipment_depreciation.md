For small business owners in Canada, intermediate-level tax write-offs can lead to substantial savings, though they require a bit more involvement compared to simpler deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This guide focuses on two key strategies: hiring family members and leveraging equipment depreciation. These fall under the broader category of [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing tax deductions and credits]] for businesses.

## Hiring a Family Member

You can deduct salaries paid to family members, provided the salary is reasonable and accurately reflects the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. To avoid issues with the CRA, it's crucial to treat the employment of family members like any other employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

This strategy can help manage your business effectively and keep funds within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### Example: Deducting a Son's Salary

Consider hiring your son to manage your social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>:
*   **Hourly Rate**: $20 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>
*   **Weekly Hours**: 20 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>
*   **Annual Hours**: 1,040 hours (20 hours/week x 52 weeks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>
*   **Annual Salary**: $20,800 ($20/hour x 1,040 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>

This entire $20,800 is a deductible business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. If your business's taxable income is normally $100,000, deducting your son's salary would reduce your taxable income to $79,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## Equipment Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance - CCA)

When you purchase assets like computers, machinery, or furniture for your business, you generally cannot deduct the full cost in the year of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. Instead, you depreciate the cost over several years, a process known as Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

The CRA categorizes different types of assets into specific classes, each with its own depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. For example:
*   **Computers**: Fall under Class 50, with a 55% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   **Furniture**: Falls under Class 8, with a 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

Applying the correct class and rate is essential for accurate deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

### Example: Depreciating a Computer

Suppose you purchase a computer for $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Since computers are in Class 50, you can depreciate it at a rate of 55% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

In the first year, you can claim 55% of $2,000, which amounts to $1,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The remaining balance can then be depreciated in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

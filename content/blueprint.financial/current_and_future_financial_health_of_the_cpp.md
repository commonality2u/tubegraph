Despite common worries, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is more secure than many Canadians believe. A significant portion of Canadians (64%) do not expect the CPP to be available upon their retirement, a concern fueled by factors such as aging populations, rising costs, and discussions about Alberta potentially leaving the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the CPP's strong financial standing and robust oversight mechanisms indicate its long-term viability.

## Reasons for CPP's Security

### 1. Outperforming Expectations

The CPP has consistently exceeded financial projections, demonstrating its robust health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

*   **Recent Performance**: For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | CPP Investments]] reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return, increasing the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
*   **Exceeding Projections**: This asset total significantly surpasses initial expectations. In 2000, the CPP was projected to reach $425 billion by 2023; instead, it hit $632 billion in 2023, over $150 billion more than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This outperformance highlights the effectiveness of its [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | smart investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: The fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even during challenging economic periods, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This growth ensures the CPP can easily support the increasing number of retirees today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, providing confidence that [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement benefits]] will be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### 2. Sustainability for Generations

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | Canada Pension Plan]] is designed for long-term [[impact_of_demographic_changes_on_cpp_sustainability | sustainability]], ensuring future generations are also provided for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

*   **Actuarial Reports**: Every three years, the Chief Actuary of Canada assesses the CPP's financial health. The latest report confirms the CPP is on solid ground for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Projected Growth**: The fund's assets are projected to grow substantially:
    *   By 2030: Expected to reach about $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   By 2040: Projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   By 2050: Expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Solvency**: These forecasts demonstrate the CPP's long-term [[impact_of_demographic_changes_on_cpp_sustainability | sustainability]] and its ability to support current and future Canadian generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The projections indicate the CPP will likely remain financially stable for at least 75 years, potentially solvent into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 3. Trustworthiness of Reporting

The accuracy of CPP reports is ensured through multiple layers of independent oversight and auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **Chief Actuary of Canada**: This office conducts impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health, operating independently of political influence to ensure accurate reports free from external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 31st Actuarial Report (2022) affirmed the CPP's [[impact_of_demographic_changes_on_cpp_sustainability | sustainability]] for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)**: The PBO independently reviews these reports, adding another layer of nonpartisan scrutiny to ensure financial data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **External Audits**: Further assurance comes from external audits. For example, Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | CPP Investments]] maintained effective internal control over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Peace of Mind**: This multi-layered scrutiny by independent bodies and external auditors provides strong reasons to trust the reliability and transparency of CPP reports, suggesting Canadians do not need to worry about the CPP running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

> ### Pro Tip
> Always seek independent audits or third-party reviews when evaluating financial reports, whether for a [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | pension fund]] or an investment opportunity, to make informed and trustworthy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### 4. Investment Performance and Management

The [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | investment strategies and performance of CPP Investments]] are central to the CPP's long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

*   **Strong Long-Term Returns**: [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | CPP Investments]] delivered a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This performance has driven the fund's assets to $632 billion, significantly surpassing projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Diversified Global Portfolio**: The fund's portfolio is globally diversified across 56 countries, investing in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. With only 12% of the portfolio invested in Canada, the international spread reduces home risk and reliance on any single economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Active Management Strategy**: [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | CPP Investments]] employs an active management approach to achieve returns by investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While this strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term, it may underperform in specific years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, the 8% net return for fiscal 2024 fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Suitability for Pension Needs**: Active management is crucial for a [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | pension fund]] like the CPP to address the complexities of [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | pension payouts]] and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The significant growth of CPP's assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates sound investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The CPP serves as Canada's reliable retirement backbone, with its current financial health and long-term projections supporting its continued security for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

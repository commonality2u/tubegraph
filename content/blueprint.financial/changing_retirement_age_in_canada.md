The traditional notion of retiring at 65, which was prevalent when houses were affordable and life expectancy was shorter, is no longer the norm in Canada [00:00:00]. Today, Canadians can expect to live 30 or more years in retirement, making careful [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | financial planning]] crucial to avoid running out of money [00:00:09]. Increasingly, Canadians are working past 65 [00:00:15].

## The Shifting Landscape of Retirement Age

The average retirement age in Canada has significantly increased over the past few decades [00:00:35]. In 1997, the average retirement age was 60.9 years [00:00:44]. By 2010, it had risen to 62.5 years, and by 2020, it reached 64.3 years [00:00:50]. As of 2024, the average retirement age has climbed to 65.3 years, marking the highest point in nearly half a century [00:00:57]. This represents a four-year increase in less than one generation [00:01:03]. The median retirement age is also now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age [00:01:09].

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed [00:01:21]. Approximately 12% chose to work to remain active, connected, and fulfilled, while 9% did so out of [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | financial necessity]] [00:01:27]. This indicates that over half of older working retirees are doing so by choice [00:01:37].

The type of employment also influences retirement age [00:01:48]:
*   **Public sector employees** tend to retire earlier, around age 63 [00:01:51].
*   **Private sector workers** typically work until about 65 and a half [00:01:56].
*   **Self-employed Canadians** push it further, retiring on average at nearly 69 years old [00:02:01].

## Reasons for Working Longer

There are six primary reasons why more Canadians are choosing to work longer and retire later [00:02:14]:

### 1. Increased Life Expectancy
Canadians are living longer than in the past [00:02:22]. Life expectancy is not fixed; it increases as one ages. For instance, at 40, the average Canadian man can expect to live to 78 and women to 83 [00:02:47]. By 60, men are projected to live to about 80.5 years and women to 85 [00:03:01]. If a Canadian makes it to 65 and is healthy, they likely have two or more decades ahead [00:03:17]. This means retirement is now a 20 to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and health management [00:03:28].

### 2. Changes in Pension Coverage
The traditional defined benefit pension, offering a predictable income for life, is becoming less common, particularly in the private sector [00:03:41]. Many private sector workers now have defined contribution plans, where retirement income depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual [00:03:56]. Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning the majority must manage their own [[retirement_planning_strategies for Canadians | retirement planning]] through savings like RRSPs and TFSAs [00:04:07].

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without a matching increase in income [00:04:28].
*   **Shelter costs** have risen significantly; as of February 2024, they were up 6.2% year-over-year, with mortgage interest costs jumping over 26% [00:04:35].
*   **Food prices** have increased by over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise [00:04:55].
*   **Healthcare costs**, beyond public health services, include out-of-pocket expenses for dental care, glasses, physiotherapy, and prescriptions, which typically increase with age [00:05:04].

For those relying on Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and savings, it is becoming more challenging to make ends meet, especially when dealing with rent, debt, or supporting family [00:05:18]. To help manage finances in retirement, there is a free guide available with [[retirement_tax_strategies in Canada | five proven tax-saving strategies in retirement]] [00:05:31].

### 4. Less Physical Work
Historically, physical demands often dictated retirement age [00:05:41]. However, more Canadians now work in knowledge-based or service jobs that are less physically demanding [00:05:55]. If a job is not physically taxing and one remains mentally sharp, there is less incentive to stop working [00:06:05]. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection [00:07:01].

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
There is a generational mindset shift where retirement is viewed less as an escape and more as freedom [00:06:27]. This freedom might involve part-time consulting, teaching, freelancing, or starting a dream business [00:06:42]. Retirement is increasingly seen as a gradual transition rather than an abrupt stop at 65 [00:06:50]. Many retirees find that endless free time is not always fulfilling, leading them to reshape their work to better fit their lifestyle [00:07:08].

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce," where Canadians over 50 separate, is quietly reshaping retirement timelines [00:07:19]. Late-life separations often necessitate a major financial reset, involving asset division, legal fees, and the cost of supporting two households [00:07:30]. This can derail existing [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement plans]], forcing individuals to delay retirement, downsize, or re-enter the workforce [00:07:54].

### Uncertainty and Peace of Mind
Uncertainty can be a significant deterrent to retirement [00:08:05]. Volatile markets, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation can cause hesitation [00:08:09]. Rising healthcare costs, geopolitical tensions, and general anxiety about the future also contribute [00:08:18]. Many Canadians delay retirement not out of necessity, but to build a larger financial buffer for peace of mind [00:08:24]. Relying on the Canadian [[retirement_income_system in Canada | CPP, OAS]], and personal savings can feel riskier given potential market dips, medical emergencies, or rent hikes [00:08:37]. Therefore, working a few more years to delay tapping into savings and build a buffer is a common strategy [00:08:48].

However, delaying retirement means trading valuable time, which becomes more precious with age [00:09:02]. It's suggested that retiring as early as safely possible allows individuals to buy back time and enjoy more healthy years [00:09:08].

## Retirement Planning Scenario: Keanu

Using financial planning software, even small adjustments can significantly impact retirement outcomes [00:09:21].
Consider Keanu, a 65-year-old single individual aiming for a modest lifestyle with $50,000 in annual spending [00:09:28]. He earned $90,000 annually before retirement, has $400,000 in his RRSP, $100,000 in his TFSA, and his home is paid off [00:09:38]. He has no corporate pension, and his CPP and OAS are assumed to start at 65 [00:09:49].

### Scenario 1: Retiring at 65 (Cold Turkey)
If Keanu retires immediately at 65 and starts collecting CPP and OAS, he would run out of money by approximately age 83 [00:09:55]. His RRSP would deplete quickly, and his TFSA would not cover the remaining years [00:10:07]. By his mid-80s, he would have a negative net worth, assuming no health or inflation surprises [00:10:12]. This shows that $500,000 in savings may not be enough for a 25-year retirement without a solid plan [00:10:17].

### Scenario 2: Working Three More Years
If Keanu works three more years, earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save, while still taking CPP and OAS at 65, his money would easily last through age 90 [00:10:27]. He would also finish with a net estate of over $400,000 [00:10:39]. Just three extra years of work provides over a decade of financial security in retirement [00:10:43].

### Scenario 3: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP to 70 (Aggressive RRSP Withdrawal)
In this version, Keanu works two more years, but instead of starting CPP at 65, he waits until 70 to secure a higher monthly benefit [00:10:52]. However, he still experiences a shortfall [00:11:02]. By aggressively drawing from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69 to fill the income gap, his savings drain too quickly, leaving him with less in his later years, even with a stronger CPP [00:11:05]. This highlights that delaying CPP is powerful, but without a smart withdrawal [[retirement_planning_strategies for Canadians | strategy]], it can backfire [00:11:16].

### Scenario 4: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP to 70 (Strategic RRSP Withdrawal)
Keanu retires at 67 and still delays CPP to 70 [00:11:23]. This time, he draws gradually from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69, taking just enough to cover his needs while keeping taxes low [00:11:28]. This [[retirement_planning_strategies for Canadians | strategic approach]] results in a steady income throughout retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate of over $500,000 remaining by age 90 [00:11:37]. The combination of working two extra years, delaying CPP, and strategically drawing from his RRSP provides the necessary financial balance [00:11:45].

This simplified example demonstrates how the correct sequencing of payments and withdrawals can be powerful [00:12:09]. Keanu did not need to double his savings or work until 70; by adjusting a few variables, such as CPP timing, smart withdrawals, and working slightly longer, he built a feasible plan [00:12:15]. This is a core aspect of [[financial_planning_for_retirement in Canada | financial planning]], which involves considering taxes, OAS clawbacks, draw-down strategies, inflation, health costs, and estate planning [00:12:00].

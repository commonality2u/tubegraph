Moving to a new country requires more than just a change of scenery to ensure a smooth transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. One of the most crucial aspects to figure out is the residency and tax laws of your destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This can be more challenging than understanding Canadian non-residency rules, especially due to potential distance and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Residency Requirements
It is essential to research the [[visa_and_residency_options_for_expatriates | residency requirements]] of your new country, including how to apply for temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Some countries may also require you to register your address with local authorities upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Tax Laws
You need to understand what makes you a tax resident in the new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Additionally, investigate any [[potential_tax_implications_of_retiring_overseas | tax treaties with Canada]] to prevent double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

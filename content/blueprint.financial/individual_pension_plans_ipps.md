Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) are tailored pension plans designed specifically for business owners or incorporated professionals [00:03:34]. Unlike a [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)]], which has a set contribution cap, an IPP allows individuals, especially those over 40, to contribute more money while still benefiting from tax-deferred growth [00:03:43]. It functions as a corporate-sponsored pension plan intended to provide structured retirement income, making it a strategic choice for high-income earners seeking enhanced future savings [00:03:53].

## IPP vs. RRSP

While an [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] is similar to a "savings account on steroids," an IPP is more akin to a personalized pension plan, offering a more structured, powerful, and long-term security-focused approach [00:04:06]. For high-income earners aiming to maximize retirement savings, an IPP may be a more suitable option than an [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] [00:04:16].

### Key Differences:

*   **Reduced [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] Contribution** Once an IPP is established, the ability to contribute to an [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] is reduced or eliminated, as the IPP takes priority in pension contributions [00:04:25].
*   **Larger Contributions** IPPs permit significantly higher contributions than [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSPs]], particularly for older individuals [00:04:39]. This allows for greater tax deferral and faster growth of retirement savings [00:04:46].
*   **Reliable Retirement Income** With an IPP, retirement withdrawals follow a structured, pension-like system [00:04:50]. Unlike an [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]], where individuals control withdrawal timing and amounts, an IPP provides predictable income, aiding in more confident retirement planning [00:04:56]. It is very similar to a defined benefit pension plan [00:05:05].

## When an IPP Outperforms an RRSP

IPPs offer distinct advantages in specific scenarios, making them a powerful tool for wealth building:

*   **High-Income Business Owners**
    *   For instance, Daniel, a 50-year-old business owner earning $250,000 annually, had already maximized his [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] contributions [00:05:14]. Instead of being limited to the 2024 [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] cap of $31,560, setting up an IPP allowed him to contribute over $50,000 annually [00:05:23]. This strategy increased his tax deductions and substantially boosted his retirement savings [00:05:33].

*   **Late Start to Retirement Savings**
    *   Linda, a 55-year-old professional who owns a corporation and realized she hadn't saved enough for retirement, was able to establish an IPP [00:05:41]. This enabled her to make past service contributions, covering previous working years [00:05:50]. This move rapidly grew her retirement fund while simultaneously reducing her corporation's taxable income [00:05:57].

*   **Corporate Tax Efficiency**
    *   Ryan, an incorporated consultant in his 40s, transitioned from an [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] to an IPP for greater tax efficiency [00:06:04]. Since IPP contributions are considered a corporate expense, his company's taxable income was reduced, leading to lower corporate taxes while securing a stable retirement fund [00:06:14].

### IPP Success Story

One client, a doctor, increased his tax deductions by over 50% compared to his [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] after switching to an IPP, securing a steady pension for retirement [00:06:26].

Setting up an IPP can be complex, but it offers significant tax and retirement benefits [00:06:38].

Canadians often miss out on tax-free growth in retirement by not properly managing their RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) withdrawals, leading to wasted TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. A key strategy involves moving funds from an RSP/RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) into a TFSA to reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and secure a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This approach contributes to [[role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | the role of TFSA in retirement planning]] and [[using_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | using TFSA in retirement planning]].

## The Problem: Underutilized TFSA Room in Retirement

Despite the benefits, many Canadians underutilize their TFSA accounts. Out of 17.77 million Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This indicates that the vast majority are missing out on the significant tax-free growth potential offered by the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with substantial unused TFSA contribution room, often tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully [[maximizing_tfsa_for_taxfree_growth | maximize their TFSA contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% of them maximize contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, peaking at 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This suggests a strategic reason for increased TFSA maximization in later retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are effective for saving during working years, but withdrawals are taxed as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This can push retirees into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Upon reaching age 71, the CRA mandates converting an RSP into a RRIF and beginning compulsory withdrawals, regardless of immediate financial need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Conversion

The core strategy is to transfer any excess funds withdrawn from an RSP/RRIF that are not needed for living expenses directly into a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Investing these funds within the TFSA can result in significant long-term tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This method aligns with [[utilizing_tfsa_and_rrsp_for_tax_efficiency | utilizing TFSA and RRSP for tax efficiency]].

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually, which is taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in tax, leaving $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 of this for his living expenses, as his CPP, OAS, and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead of placing this in a normal savings or taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Growth Comparison:**

*   **TFSA Scenario:** Assuming a 6% annual return, Eddie's TFSA grows significantly.
    *   Year 1: $10,000 contribution grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   After 10 years: With consistent $10,000 annual contributions ($100,000 total contributions), the TFSA grows to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **Non-Registered Account Scenario:** If Eddie invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account at a 6% annual rate, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, resulting in an effective tax rate of around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   After 10 years: The non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, which is significantly less than the $132,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   If placed in a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the amount would be much lower, potentially around $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

By contributing his excess RRIF income to his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Increases his TFSA balance to $132,000 compared to $120,000 (or $55,000 in a savings account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

This approach not only [[maximizing_tfsa_for_taxfree_growth | maximizes retirement savings]] but also provides flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or leave them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The example used $10,000 for simplicity, but contribution amounts can vary based on individual TFSA room and situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. [[Importance of consistent contributions to TFSA | Consistent contributions]] are key.

## Important Considerations

*   **Prioritize TFSA:** Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have available TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Avoid Large Withdrawals:** Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, for example, from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Does This Strategy Eliminate RSP Taxes on Withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals are still considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

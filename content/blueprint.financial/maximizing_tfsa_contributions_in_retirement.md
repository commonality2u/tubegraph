Many Canadian retirees can significantly reduce their tax bill by strategically managing their RSP withdrawals and leveraging their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A common mistake is leaving money on the table due to improper RSP withdrawal management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By implementing a smart RSP to TFSA tactic, individuals can reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and enjoy a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

Despite the benefits, many Canadians, including retirees, are not fully [[maximizing_tfsa_growth | maximizing TFSA growth]] potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Out of 17.77 million Canadians holding a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. A significant number of retirees enter their golden years with unused TFSA contribution room, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully [[maximizing_tfsa_growth | maximize TFSA contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For instance, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60 to 64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, peaking at 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This increase in later retirement years is directly related to the strategy outlined below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) are excellent for saving during working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. However, every dollar withdrawn from an RSP is taxed as income, which can push individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Upon reaching age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates the conversion of RSPs into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs), initiating compulsory withdrawals whether the money is needed or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

The key strategy is to deposit any excess funds from mandatory RSP/RRIF withdrawals into a TFSA and invest them, particularly if the funds are not immediately needed for living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can save thousands of dollars over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP into a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Mandatory Withdrawal:** The CRA requires Eddie to withdraw $30,000 per year, which is taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Tax Impact:** In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Living Expenses:** Eddie only needs $11,000 of this amount for his living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Excess Income:** This leaves Eddie with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Instead of putting this excess income into a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

#### TFSA Growth Scenario

Assuming an average annual return of 6%:
*   **Year 1:** Eddie contributes $10,000, which grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie continues to add $10,000 annually, and compounding accelerates the growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, and it has grown to approximately $132,000â€”all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

#### Comparison: Non-Registered Account

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would still grow at 6% annually. However, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, reducing his effective return to about 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. After 10 years, his non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes, significantly less than the $132,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. A taxable savings account earning only 1% would result in an even lower amount, potentially around $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

By contributing his excess RRIF income into his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Increases his TFSA balance to $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account or potentially $55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Maximizes his retirement savings and gains the flexibility to use his TFSA funds for future needs or let them continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Pro Tips for [[Optimizing TFSA for longterm financial goals | Optimizing TFSA for Long-Term Financial Goals]]

*   **Prioritize TFSA:** Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have available TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This allows your money to grow tax-free, preventing a portion of your gains from being lost to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Strategic RSP Withdrawals:** Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years when you anticipate having high income, such as from the sale of a property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Does this Eliminate RSP Taxes?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals remain taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties like OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The goal is to minimize tax impact while [[maximizing_retirement_and_pension_tax_savings | maximizing overall retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

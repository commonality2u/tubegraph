Managing capital gains and losses before year-end can significantly reduce one's tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing Capital Gains and Losses

### Tax Loss Harvesting
If capital gains were realized earlier in the year, consider realizing capital losses by selling underperforming investments to offset those gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This strategy, known as [[advanced_strategies_like_income_splitting_and_tax_loss_harvesting | tax loss harvesting]], reduces taxable income and can help rebalance an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

*   **Example**: If $10,000 in capital gains were made from selling property, and then another property is sold for a $4,000 loss before year-end, the taxable gain drops to $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Caution**: Selling decisions should not be based solely on this factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Deferring Capital Gains
For profitable investments, consider delaying their sale until January or later to defer taxes for another year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Example**: Selling a stock for a $15,000 gain in January 2025 pushes the tax payment into 2026, providing extra time to manage cash flow and allow money to accumulate interest or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Complex Scenarios and Considerations

Capital gains and losses scenarios can become complex, especially with capital losses that can be carried forward or backward, or if income varies significantly year to year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### New Capital Gains Inclusion Rules
For assets of a certain size, the new capital gains inclusion rules must be factored in, which involve a 66.7% inclusion rate for capital gains over $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Retirees and OAS Clawbacks
Retirees need to manage capital gains carefully to avoid triggering OAS clawbacks and other recovery taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Importance for Business Owners
[[planning_and_implementing_taxsaving_strategies | Capital gains and losses planning]] is an area where financial advisors spend significant time with clients, particularly business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It is crucial to carefully determine the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is a critical retirement planning decision, as it significantly impacts a retiree's overall financial picture and interacts with other [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income sources in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While starting CPP at age 60 provides earlier access to funds, delaying it can lead to substantially higher monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying CPP

Delaying CPP beyond age 60, particularly until age 70, results in a considerable increase in monthly benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, if a baseline CPP payment at age 65 is $1,000 per month, starting at age 60 reduces it to $640 (a 36% reduction), while delaying to age 70 increases it to $1,420 (a 42% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This means delaying to age 70 can more than double the monthly benefit compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Utilizing Other Income Sources to Bridge the Gap

One key reason to delay CPP is if you possess sufficient [[alternative_income_sources for retirees | income or savings]] to cover expenses until a later age, such as 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This strategy allows your personal investments to continue growing while you wait for the increased CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

Examples of such sources include:
*   **Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   **Workplace pensions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   **Non-registered assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>

By drawing from these sources during ages 60-70, you can defer CPP and receive a "huge boost" to your [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income]] starting at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This approach can lead to a more financially secure retirement with higher guaranteed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. However, if immediate income is needed at age 60, starting CPP early might be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## CPP's Inflation Indexation

Unlike many other investments, CPP payments are indexed to inflation, meaning they increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For instance, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This feature provides a unique and valuable hedge against inflation in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The longer CPP is delayed, the larger the inflation-indexed payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Interaction with Other Government Benefits

### Old Age Security (OAS) Clawback

Taking CPP early, especially if combined with other high income, can impact Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. If total income exceeds certain thresholds (e.g., $90,997 as of recent figures), OAS payments are subject to clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Delaying CPP can sometimes help manage overall income to stay below these thresholds, allowing retirees to keep more of their OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

Similarly, if you anticipate having a higher retirement income from sources like RSPs or work pensions, you may not qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In such cases, delaying CPP to receive larger payments won't affect GIS eligibility, as you wouldn't qualify for it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Strategic RSP Tax Planning

Delaying CPP can be part of a broader tax planning strategy, particularly for RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. If you want to draw down your RSP quicker between ages 60 and 70 to minimize taxes upon death and leave more for your estate, delaying CPP can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

For instance, if annual living expenses are $40,000, and you withdraw this amount from your RSP from ages 60-70, you reduce your RSP balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. When CPP kicks in at age 70 (e.g., $21,000 annually), you would only need to draw an additional $19,000 from other sources like remaining RSPs, TFSAs, or work pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This strategy allows for more efficient estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Working in Your 60s

If you continue working into your 60s, you might not need CPP income immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This allows you to delay CPP for additional payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Furthermore, you would continue making CPP contributions while working, even if you started receiving benefits early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The benefit from delaying CPP is likely to be greater than taking it early and investing it, as achieving such an increase through market investments can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Predictable vs. Uncertain Income

Delaying CPP offers a more predictable and stable source of income in later retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. By using savings like RSPs or TFSAs to cover expenses in early retirement (e.g., ages 60-65) and delaying CPP, you trade potentially fluctuating investment returns for a guaranteed, higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This positions [[cpp_as_part_of_a_diversified_retirement_income | CPP as part of a diversified retirement income]] and a crucial component of financial stability.

Ultimately, the decision of when to start CPP benefits depends on your personal financial situation, health, and other [[supplemental_income_options for retirees | supplemental income options for retirees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

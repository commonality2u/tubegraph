Overcontributing to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can lead to significant penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. These mistakes often occur when individuals do not diligently track their contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## RRSP Contribution Limits

If you exceed your RRSP contribution limit, the excess amount is subject to a 1% monthly penalty until it is withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. However, you are permitted to over-contribute to your RRSP by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This provides a small buffer for maximizing contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## TFSA Contribution Limits

Similar to RRSPs, excess TFSA contributions incur a 1% penalty per month on the over-contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Unlike RRSPs, there is no $2,000 buffer for TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Preventing Overcontribution

Many individuals incorrectly assume the CRA will notify them if they overcontribute to an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. However, penalties will silently accumulate until the mistake is discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

To avoid penalties, it is crucial to:
*   **Track your own contributions** rather than depending solely on your My CRA account, as it may not be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   **Act quickly** if you realize an overcontribution has occurred. Withdrawing the excess amount as soon as possible can help minimize penalties and prevent tax complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

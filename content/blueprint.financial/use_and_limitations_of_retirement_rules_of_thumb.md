When considering how much money is needed for retirement, one common approach involves using "rules of thumb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These methods serve as a good starting point for individuals trying to estimate their target retirement number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Common Retirement Rules of Thumb

### Age-Based Savings Targets
This strategy suggests accumulating a certain multiple of your current salary by specific ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>:
*   By age 30, aim to have one year of your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   By age 40, aim for three times your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   By age 50, aim for six times your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   By retirement age, the target is typically between 8 to 10 times your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

For example, if you earn $60,000 annually:
*   By age 30, you should have $60,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   By age 40, $180,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   By age 50, $480,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### The 4% Rule
This rule posits that you can withdraw 4% of your retirement savings each year without exhausting your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For instance, with $1 million saved, you could withdraw $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This rate provides a buffer against potential underperformance of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. A higher withdrawal rate, such as Vincent's 10% in a [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | failed retirement scenario]], can lead to funds being depleted quickly, especially if investments do not perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income
Another common guideline is to aim for 70 to 80% of your pre-retirement income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. A more conservative approach suggests planning for 80 to 90% of pre-retirement income to account for unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For someone earning $100,000 pre-retirement, this means planning for an annual retirement income of $80,000 to $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Relevant Data Points: Household Expenditures
Statistics Canada data from 2021 indicates that the average expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was approximately $61,800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. In contrast, households aged 40 to 54 had average annual expenditures of $120,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This suggests that expenses typically decrease significantly by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Retirees are commonly observed spending between $3,000 to $7,000 per month for singles and $5,000 to $9,000 per month for couples, depending on their desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Pros of Using Rules of Thumb

Rules of thumb offer several advantages for retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>:
*   **Simplicity**: They are straightforward and easy to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Quick Estimates**: They provide rapid estimations of required savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Rough Guidelines**: They offer a general direction for starting retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Cons and Limitations of Rules of Thumb

Despite their simplicity, rules of thumb have significant drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:
*   **Oversimplification**: They do not account for individual circumstances, [[calculating_retirement_expenses_and_planning_for_inflation | inflation]], or unforeseen expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Risk of Running Out of Money**: Sole reliance on these rules can lead to insufficient funds if expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This risk is not well-modeled by these simple rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Lack of Flexibility**: They do not easily adapt to changes in lifestyle or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

While useful as a starting point, relying solely on rules of thumb for retirement planning can lead to serious consequences, such as having to work beyond planned retirement age or relying on minimal government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

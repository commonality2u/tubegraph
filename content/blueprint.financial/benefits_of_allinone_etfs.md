[[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | All-in-one ETFs]], also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by bundling multiple ETFs into a single fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They offer a straightforward approach to building a diversified portfolio with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Key Advantages

Investors favor [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] due to several significant benefits:

### Instant Diversification
[[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | All-in-one ETFs]] provide immediate diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This eliminates the need to pick individual investments or manage multiple funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For example, Vanguard's VGRO offers exposure to over 13,000 companies worldwide, blending Canadian, US, International, and emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This diversification helps reduce risk and can enhance returns by spreading investments across different countries, industries, and asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Low-Cost Alternative
One of the biggest advantages of [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] is their significantly lower fee structure compared to traditional mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While Canadian mutual funds typically charge management expense ratios (MERs) of around 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] generally charge between 0.2% to 0.25% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This difference can lead to substantial savings and improved long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Automatic Rebalancing
[[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | All-in-one ETFs]] automatically rebalance their holdings to maintain the target asset mix, such as a specific stock-to-bond ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This means investors do not need to manually adjust their portfolios, as the ETF handles the buying and selling within itself to keep the asset allocation on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Time-Saving
By providing a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of investments, [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] eliminate the need for extensive research into individual stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This "set it and forget it" approach saves considerable time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. As Economist Paul Samuelson famously stated, "investing should be more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Ideal for Smaller Accounts
For those just starting with investment accounts like a TFSA or RRSP, a single [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]] offers instant diversification without the need to spread money across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This simplifies the initial investment process significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Who Benefits Most?

[[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | All-in-one ETFs]] are particularly well-suited for:

*   **Beginners:** They offer a simple, low-maintenance portfolio for new investors who want to avoid picking stocks or rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Busy Professionals:** Individuals with demanding careers can rely on [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] to manage their investments in the background without constant adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Parents Investing for Kids:** For long-term savings accounts like RESPs, these ETFs provide diversification and require minimal maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors:** They enable diversification from day one, even with a smaller capital base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Performance Example

An investment of $10,000 into Vanguard's VGRO from January 2020 to 2025 would have grown to approximately $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This demonstrates the power of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Important Considerations

While [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] offer numerous benefits, investors should be aware of potential pitfalls:

*   **Honest Self-Assessment:** When choosing an [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]], it's crucial to honestly assess your risk tolerance through tools like investor questionnaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Selecting the wrong risk level (e.g., too conservative or too aggressive) can lead to suboptimal growth or panic selling during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This is one of the [[common_investment_mistakes_with_etfs | common investment mistakes with ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Tweaking:** The "set it and forget it" approach is key to [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Constantly checking accounts or making unnecessary changes due to market swings can hurt long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **One Fund Per Account:** An [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]] is designed to be a standalone investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Adding multiple [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] or combining them with other specialized ETFs in the same account can disrupt their carefully designed balance and complicate your asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For example, VGRO already covers 13,000 companies, providing ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> While a single [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]] is generally sufficient for one account (e.g., TFSA), you can use separate accounts for different strategies. For instance, you might use an [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]] for long-term [[benefits_of_taxfree_growth_in_tfsa | tax-free growth in a TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, build your own stock portfolio in an RRSP, and focus on tax-efficient, swap-based ETFs like Horizons for non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

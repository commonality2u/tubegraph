Taxes can be a significant hurdle when attempting to grow investments, potentially consuming up to half of investment income in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, various practical strategies can help reduce tax bills and accelerate wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Choosing Tax-Efficient Investments in Taxable Accounts

A simple yet effective way to retain more of your money for growth over time is by selecting tax-efficient investments for taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### ETFs vs. Mutual Funds

Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) generally trade assets less frequently than mutual funds, which leads to fewer taxable events for the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Actively managed mutual funds often involve constant buying and selling, passing on the tax bill for these trades to the investor, even if they haven't sold anything themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For taxable accounts, ETFs are typically the more astute choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Non-Dividend Paying Stocks and ETFs

Stocks that purposely do not pay annual dividends, such as Berkshire Hathaway, are excellent for taxable accounts because they avoid yearly taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Gains from these investments are only taxed upon the sale of the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Under new rules, only 50% of capital gains up to $250,000 are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This makes them significantly more tax-efficient than dividend-paying or interest-generating investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. For instance, a $20,000 gain is taxed on only $10,000, and only when the stock is sold in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Permanent Life Insurance

Beyond protection, permanent life insurance can grow investments within the policy, and the payout to beneficiaries is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This is an advanced strategy to consider for estate planning to reduce taxes passed to loved ones after death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Prioritizing the Right Registered Accounts

Choosing the correct investment accounts to prioritize can result in significant savings, potentially tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

> [!example] TFSA vs. Taxable Account Illustration
> Jason, at 30, invests $10,000 in both a TFSA and a non-registered taxable account over 30 years with a 7% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. His tax rate on the non-registered account is 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
>
> *   **TFSA:** $10,000 grows tax-free to $76,122 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
> *   **Non-registered taxable account:** The same $10,000 grows to only $42,000 due to ongoing taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
>
> The TFSA outperforms the non-registered account by $34,122, nearly doubling its value, showcasing the power of tax-free compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Here is the recommended order of priority for contributing to accounts to maximize savings and minimize taxes:

1.  **RSP with Employer Matching:** Always maximize employer matching first, as it's essentially free money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. For example, a 50% match up to $1,500 means an easy $750 added to savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
2.  **RESP:** If saving for a child's education, the RESP offers a 20% government match up to $500 per year per child, with a lifetime maximum of $7,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Lower-income families can also receive the Canada Learning Bond, potentially adding up to $2,000 without requiring contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
3.  **FHSA:** First-time home buyers should prioritize the FHSA, which offers tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Funds can grow tax-free or be transferred to an RSP later, even if home ownership isn't immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
4.  **TFSA or RSP:** These are the most common choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   **TFSA:** Best for flexibility, emergencies, or lower-income years, as funds can be withdrawn tax-free at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It's the most versatile and flexible account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   **RSP:** Ideal for higher incomes due to tax-deductible contributions and tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Both RSP and FHSA come with withdrawal restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The final order of priority is RSP with employer matching, RESP, FHSA, and then TFSA or RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Optimizing Asset Location

Tax efficiency involves not just what you invest in, but also where those investments are held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Different income types (interest, dividends, capital gains) are taxed distinctly in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Breakdown of Tax Rules

*   **Interest Income:** Taxed at your full marginal tax rate, making it the least tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Canadian Dividends:** Benefit from the dividend tax credit, which reduces the effective tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Foreign Dividends and Interest:** Subject to withholding taxes that cannot be recovered in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains:** Only 50% of gains up to $250,000 are taxable, and 2/3rds after that, making them more tax-efficient than interest or dividends in most cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Key Strategies for Asset Location

1.  **RSP for US Dividend-Paying Stocks:** Holding these stocks in an RSP avoids the 15% withholding tax on US dividends due to the Canada-US tax treaty, ensuring the full dividend amount is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
2.  **TFSA for High-Growth Investments:** Use a TFSA to shelter capital gains and allow high-growth investments to compound tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Avoid foreign dividend stocks in a TFSA if possible, as withholding taxes apply and cannot be recovered, leading to a loss of up to 15% of dividends annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For example, Apple stock in a TFSA would yield less dividend income than in an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
3.  **Taxable Accounts for Canadian Dividend Stocks:** If registered accounts are maxed out, Canadian dividend-paying stocks are relatively efficient in taxable non-registered accounts due to the dividend tax credit, which significantly reduces taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This makes them more tax-efficient than other income types in a taxable account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For instance, $1,000 in Canadian dividends might result in an effective tax rate of around 7% for someone in a 30% tax bracket, paying only about $70 in taxes, compared to $300 on the same amount of interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
4.  **Interest-Generating Investments in Registered Accounts:** Place investments that generate interest income, such as GICs or bonds, in RSPs or TFSAs to avoid high taxes on interest income in taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## [[income_splitting_strategies | Income Splitting Strategies]]

[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is a more advanced strategy that involves distributing income among family members to lower the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

1.  **Using FHSA for Income Splitting:** The FHSA can help couples save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. If one partner has maxed out their tax-advantaged accounts and the other has unused FHSA room, the higher-income partner can gift money to the lower-income partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The lower-income partner then contributes it to their FHSA, allowing the couple to avoid investing in a taxable account, claim a tax deduction, and enjoy tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. For example, if Jim gifts $8,000 to Pam for her FHSA, she gets a $2,400 tax deduction, avoids $132 in taxes on growth, and all future growth is tax-free, saving $2,532 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
2.  **Spousal RSP Contributions:** Spousal RSPs help balance retirement incomes and reduce taxes for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The higher-income spouse contributes to the lower-income spouse's RSP, receiving an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. In retirement, the lower-income spouse withdraws the funds at their lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. For instance, Jim contributes $12,000 to Pam's RSP, lowering his taxes by $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. When Pam withdraws in retirement, she pays only $2,400 in taxes, saving the couple $1,800 overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
3.  **Splitting Capital Losses:** Investment losses can be converted into tax savings by transferring capital losses between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For example, Jim's $4,000 capital loss can reduce Pam's $15,000 in capital gains, saving the couple $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

> [!tip] Pro Tip for Capital Loss Splitting
> This strategy only works in non-registered accounts, and the buyer must hold the shares for at least 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## [[tax_loss_harvesting_strategy | Tax Loss Harvesting]]

[[tax_loss_harvesting_strategy | Tax loss harvesting]] allows you to save on taxes by using losing investments to offset gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

*   **How it Works:** If you sell an investment at a loss, that loss can reduce taxes on gains from other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. If losses exceed gains, they can be carried forward to future years or even back to previous years to obtain a tax refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. For instance, selling a stock for a $10,000 gain and then selling another stock that's down $6,000 means you're only taxed on $4,000 instead of $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

> [!warning] The Superficial Loss Rule
> Be aware of this rule: If you or your spouse buy back the same stock within 30 days of selling it, the CRA will not allow you to claim the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Instead, they roll it into the cost of your new shares, delaying the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Bonus Tips: Avoiding Costly Mistakes

Even the most effective tax strategies can fail due to simple errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

*   **Over-contributing to Registered Accounts:** Exceeding TFSA or RSP contribution limits can lead to hefty penalties of 1% of the excess amount per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Always track your limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Forgetting About Deadlines:** Some strategies, like RSP contributions, have strict deadlines (e.g., 60 days after year-end) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Missing these can mean losing out on tax deductions for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Not Planning for Withdrawals:** Withdrawals from registered accounts like RSPs can trigger unexpected taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Have a plan for managing these withdrawals tax-efficiently, especially in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

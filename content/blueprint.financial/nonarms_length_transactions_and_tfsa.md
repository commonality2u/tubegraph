The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) carefully monitors investments within a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) that involve non-arm's length transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:09">[06:16:09]</a>. These are investments where the TFSA holder, their family members, or close associates maintain significant control or influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:02">[06:23:02]</a>. Such transactions are considered a "red flag" by the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:08">[06:13:08]</a>.

## Why Non-Arm's Length Transactions are a Red Flag

These types of transactions trigger serious penalties because they can be used to unfairly shift wealth into a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:19">[06:30:19]</a>. The CRA views them as attempts to gain an undue tax benefit rather than genuine market-based investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

## Examples of Non-Arm's Length Penalties

Several scenarios can trigger a non-arm's length penalty:
*   **Investing in a private business** where you or a family member has control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:03">[06:39:03]</a>.
*   **Buying shares in a company** where you or a relative owns more than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:08">[06:43:08]</a>.
*   **Structuring friendly transactions** designed to unfairly boost your TFSA balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:08">[06:47:08]</a>.

## Penalties for Non-Arm's Length Transactions

If the CRA deems an investment to be non-arm's length, severe penalties can be imposed:
*   A **50% penalty** on the investment's fair market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:02">[07:14:02]</a>.
*   A **100% tax on future gains** from those shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:06">[07:23:06]</a>.
*   A TFSA reassessment, which effectively **wipes out the tax-free advantage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

### Case Study: Bobby Axelrod (Hypothetical)
In a hypothetical example, "Bobby Axelrod" buys $50,000 worth of shares in his business partner's new startup within his TFSA, expecting massive tax-free gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:08">[06:51:08]</a>. Because Axelrod has influence over the business and the transaction is not at arm's length, the CRA slaps him with a 50% penalty on the shares' fair market value, instantly losing $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. If those shares grow to $500,000, the CRA takes all of the gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

## How to Avoid the Trap

To avoid issues with non-arm's length transactions:
*   **Do not invest in companies where you or your family members have ownership or control** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:01">[07:46:01]</a>.
*   **Be wary of structuring transactions** that could be perceived as artificial tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   If a deal within your TFSA seems "too good to be true," the CRA is likely watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:07">[07:57:07]</a>.
*   Consider getting expert guidance if you are making significant [[investment_strategies_for_tfsa | investment moves]] and are unsure of the rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:05">[11:23:05]</a>.

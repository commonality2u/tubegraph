## Stacking Credits for Families

[[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | Maximizing tax savings]] involves stacking multiple tax credits and deductions together to reduce taxable income and increase refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

### Example: Sarah and Mike's Family Tax Saving Combo

Consider Sarah and Mike, who have two young children, one of whom has a disability and both are in daycare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. They can combine:

*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**: Receiving tax-free monthly payments for child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **[[child_care_expenses_tax_deduction | Child Care Expenses Deduction]]**: Mike claims daycare expenses, which lowers his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: As one child has a disability, they receive an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

These combined savings can result in thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

### Bonus Tip: Income Splitting

[[family_tax_planning | Families]] can also split income by contributing to a spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

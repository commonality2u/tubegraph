Being self-employed in Canada offers significant opportunities to reduce your tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Even individuals in the gig economy, such as Uber drivers or DoorDash deliverers, can qualify for these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. A dollar of self-employed income is often considered more valuable than a dollar of employee income due to the available tax write-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Here are key [[simple_tax_deductions_for_canadian_small_businesses | tax strategies for self-employed Canadians]]:

## Claiming Business Expenses

Many costs associated with running a business are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. These deductions reduce your taxable income, putting more money back in your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

Eligible expenses include:
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>
*   Business travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>
*   Professional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>
*   A portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>

**Example:** If you earn $80,000 annually but claim $20,000 in business expenses, your taxable income decreases to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. At a 30% tax rate, this results in $6,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Home Office Deductions

If you work from home, you may be able to deduct a percentage of your household expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The deductible percentage is based on the amount of space in your home used for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Eligible household expenses include:
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>
*   Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

**Example:** If your home office occupies 10% of your home and your annual household expenses total $30,000, you can claim $3,000 as a deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. At a 30% tax rate, this results in $900 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Hiring a Family Member

You can shift income to a lower [[tax_planning_strategies_for_canadian_families_and_business_owners | tax bracket]] within your family by paying a reasonable salary to a spouse or family member who helps with your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This can lead to overall family tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

**Example:** If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 for their contributions, your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This results in $10,500 in savings for you, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes on their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The net family tax savings would be $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is crucial that the salary paid to a family member is **reasonable** for the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The CRA is strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

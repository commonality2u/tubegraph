A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, permanently left the country in 2024, many of whom were seeking to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For many, [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retiring abroad]] offers a path to a more affordable and comfortable retirement, often with better healthcare, weather, and lifestyle than is possible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The High Cost of Retirement in Canada

[[challenges_of_retirement_in_canada | Living in Canada]] is expensive, especially for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income level, which might have been sufficient 30 years ago, is often inadequate for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For instance, in Toronto, a one-bedroom apartment averages about $2,100 per month in rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
When factoring in additional monthly expenses such as:
*   Utilities: $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>
*   Groceries: $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   Transit pass: $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

A modest lifestyle for someone who doesn't own a home can easily exceed $3,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. CPP and OAS payments barely cover a third of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Numbeo estimates a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, and $3,500 to $4,000 per month for a modest lifestyle including a one-bedroom apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This stark reality means [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | retirement in Canada]] often feels like "running on a treadmill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, who plans to retire in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Annual Spending (Toronto)**: Approximately $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   **Annual Income (CPP/OAS)**: Around $18,000, with the rest drawn from his RRSP and TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Under this plan, Seth's savings deplete rapidly:
*   **Age 70**: His TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Age 72**: He relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, requiring over $46,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Effective tax rates creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Age 74**: He runs out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Age 76**: His net worth turns negative, illustrating the severe challenge of high [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | costs in Toronto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This example highlights how a seemingly "decent nest egg" can quickly unravel in a high-cost city without careful planning that accounts for inflation, market returns, or unexpected costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## International Cost of Living Comparisons

For Canadians seeking to make their retirement savings stretch further, moving to a country with a lower [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | cost of living]] can transform their financial outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Numbeo is a useful tool for comparing global living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Mexico (Cancun)

Mexico is a top choice for Canadian retirees due to its affordability, warm climate, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics. Dental work can be as little as 20% of the price in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Private insurance is essential as public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa for retirees requires approximately $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from major Canadian cities make visits easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns in certain regions, inconsistent infrastructure in smaller towns, and bureaucratic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

In Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 CAD per month all-in, or about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Seth's Outcome in Cancun**: With the same starting savings of $300,000, his lower living costs ($20,000/year) mean CPP and OAS cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   **Age 70**: His portfolio grows to $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
    *   **Age 80**: Portfolio reaches $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   **Age 90**: Portfolio exceeds $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
This demonstrates the potential of location to transform a retirement plan from running out of money to building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal (Porto)

For those preferring a European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | costs for Western Europe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers, with beach weather nearly year-round in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent public system accessible once a resident, with affordable private care options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The D7 passive income visa requires about €870 per month (approximately $1,400 CAD) in steady income from sources like CPP, pensions, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from Toronto and Montreal to Lisbon and Porto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Generally falls between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

In Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses adding $1,700, totaling about $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Seth's Outcome in Portugal**: Spending about $36,000 a year with $300,000 in savings and $18,000 in CPP/OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   **Age 75**: Savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   **Age 80**: Savings are just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   **Age 84**: He runs out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
While Portugal offers a better runway than Toronto, with $3,000 a month in expenses, Seth's savings still couldn't stretch far enough for a comfortable retirement to age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Thailand

Thailand remains one of the best-value retirement destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Diverse options from cool mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) and energetic cities (Bangkok), with a well-developed expat scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded. Many doctors speak English, and private hospitals often exceed expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Retirement visa requires applicants to be 50+ years old and show 800,000 Thai Baht (approx. $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Chiang Mai)**: A full lifestyle, including rent, food, and leisure, can range from $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Seth's Potential**: With $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, Thailand could be a perfect fit, covering most basic needs and allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay

Paraguay is a less common but appealing option due to its low costs and favorable tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income (CPP, OAS, RIFs, pensions) is not taxed. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Asunción)**: Living expenses average about $628 per month, with rent for a one-bedroom around $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month for comfortable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Offers relatively simple ways to obtain a permanent residency visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Seth's Potential**: This could be a "financial sweet spot" due to very low costs, tax efficiency, and ease of long-term settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain (Alicante)

Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent system, though affordable private insurance is required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living (Alicante)**: Monthly living costs are around $1,057, with city center one-bedroom rent at about $1,300, bringing total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is comparable to some parts of Canada, but potentially cheaper than Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The non-lucrative visa requires a higher income bar of about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Seth's Potential**: If Seth saves for a year or two longer, Spain offers a higher-end lifestyle with strong infrastructure and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### Old Age Security (OAS) Rule

A crucial rule to understand is the potential loss of OAS payments if you retire abroad without careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Canadian Residents**: If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you only need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Non-Residents**: If living outside Canada, you need 20 years of Canadian residency to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Exception**: If you have between 10 and 20 years of residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

For example, David had 15 years of Canadian residency, started collecting OAS in Calgary, and then moved to Thailand. Six months later, his OAS stopped because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and he didn't meet the 20-year residency mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Understanding these rules is vital to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Impact of moving abroad on Canadian retirement benefits]] can be significant.

### Other Factors

*   **Cost Comparison Tools**: Utilize resources like Numbeo to compare rent, food, and utilities in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Beyond CPP and OAS**: Do not solely rely on these benefits, as inflation, currency shifts, and unexpected healthcare costs can severely impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Be prepared for the challenges of living abroad, including distance from family, new systems, and potential language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

While a low-cost retirement can be amazing, it requires a solid financial plan that accounts for tax rules and major financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

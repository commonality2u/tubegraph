In Canada, the tax system operates on an incremental or progressive basis, meaning different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Common Misconception

A frequent error Canadians make is believing that if a raise moves them into a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]], their entire salary will be taxed at that new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For example, if someone's income increases from $55,000 to $60,000, potentially moving them from a 15% to a 20.5% federal tax bracket, they might mistakenly think their whole $60,000 is now taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This misconception can lead to the feeling that earning more money results in losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How Incremental Taxation Works

The Canadian tax system does not tax the entire income at the highest applicable rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Instead, only the portion of income that falls within a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] is taxed at the rate of that bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Consider the example of an income increase from $55,000 to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. If the first $57,375 of income is taxed at 15%, and the next [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal tax bracket]] is 20.5%:
*   The initial $57,375 of the $60,000 income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Only the amount above $57,375 – in this case, an additional $2,625 – is taxed at the higher rate of 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This means that the average or effective tax rate for the total income is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax rate (20.5% in this example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, even when entering a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]], individuals will still take home more money, as more income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

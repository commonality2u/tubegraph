After decades of diligent saving, investing, and planning, many retirees find themselves hesitant to spend their accumulated wealth, leading to what is known as the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save or spend dilemma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This reluctance often stems from a deep-seated scarcity mindset, making the [[mindset_shift_from_saving_to_spending_in_retirement | transition from saving to spending]] very uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While caution can offer certain benefits, not spending enough can also have significant negative consequences.

## Potential Downsides of Under-Spending

Under-spending in retirement can lead to several missed opportunities and diminished quality of life:

### Missed Experiences and Opportunities
Retirees who are too cautious with their spending may forgo meaningful experiences such as travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enrich their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are the moments that truly make retirement fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Healthspan Versus Lifespan
Dr. Peter Attia, in his book *Outlive*, distinguishes between lifespan and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Lifespan refers to the total number of years lived, while healthspan signifies the years spent in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Delaying spending can result in missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later in life, limiting the enjoyment of saved funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Inflation's Impact
[[impact_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | Inflation]] steadily erodes the purchasing power of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. If a retirement plan is not properly structured to account for inflation, excessive caution in spending can lead to a significant reduction in the real value of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Reasons for Hesitation and Their Perceived Benefits
Despite the drawbacks, the hesitation to spend in retirement often stems from valid concerns:

### Encourages Cautious Spending
A conservative approach to spending promotes thoughtful, deliberate decisions, preventing impulse purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Helps Money Last
This careful strategy aims to stretch retirement funds further, reducing the [[risks_of_inadequate_retirement_savings | risk of running out of money prematurely]] (known as longevity risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This is a common concern for most retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Reduces Portfolio Risk
Cautious spending can protect against market losses, particularly those occurring early in retirement, which can disproportionately drain a portfolio (known as sequence of returns risk) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Aligns with Legacy Goals
For many, a primary goal is to leave a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Being cautious with spending helps achieve these legacy goals while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance
The key to navigating the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save versus spend dilemma]] is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Many retirees struggle because they don't know how much they can safely spend due to the numerous variables and factors involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Without this clarity, it's natural to err on the side of caution to avoid the [[risks_of_inadequate_retirement_savings | risk of running out of money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

A well-structured financial plan is essential to outline how much can be afforded and to stress-test the investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This process helps retirees transition from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Case Study: Michael and Karen
Michael (66) and Karen (64) had a combined annual income of $180,000 from pensions (CPP, OAS, work pensions) and investments, with yearly expenses of only $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. They had $4 million in a diversified portfolio but were hesitant to spend more, despite a $110,000 annual surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Their goal was to increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Through financial planning, they learned that a sustainable 3.5% withdrawal rate from their portfolio could provide an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Stress-testing their portfolio for a 30% market decline and running [[impact_of_longer_life_expectancy_on_retirement_planning | longevity projections]] (to age 95) confirmed their financial security, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This newfound confidence allowed them to book luxury vacations, start home renovations, and increase charitable contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Case Study: Robert and Susan
Robert (70) and Susan (68) had a combined income of $100,000 and expenses of $75,000, with $1.2 million in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Their goal was to leave a meaningful inheritance while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They were very cautious about spending more, unsure if they could afford additional travel and leisure while maintaining their legacy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Their plan showed that a 4% withdrawal rate from their portfolio could provide $48,000 annually, totaling $148,000 with their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This significantly exceeded their expenses. To balance their lifestyle and legacy goals, a slight increase in spending from $75,000 to $85,000 per year was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Stress-testing confirmed that even with potential market downturns, their plan was sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This allowed them to enjoy a higher quality of life now while still ensuring a meaningful inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Pro Tip for Overcoming Hesitation
Clients with larger portfolios often find it harder to spend due to deeply ingrained savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. To ease into spending, it's advisable to set small, meaningful goals, such as short trips or new hobbies, to gradually shift the mindset and enjoy retirement more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

[[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | All-in-one ETFs]], also known as asset allocation ETFs, simplify investing by bundling multiple ETFs into one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They provide instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, without the need to pick individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## How to Invest Step-by-Step

### 1. Determine Your Risk Tolerance
Before purchasing an ETF, you need to assess how much risk you are comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. This assessment helps you choose the appropriate ETF, whether it's a more aggressive option like VQT or a balanced one like VBAL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

*   **Tools for Assessment**: Free tools such as the Vanguard investor questionnaire can help evaluate your comfort with market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
*   **Matching Risk to ETF**:
    *   **Higher Risk/Higher Returns**: Consider 100% stock allocations (e.g., VQTe, XCQTs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
    *   **Balanced Growth**: Options like VGRO and XGRO feature 80% stocks and 20% bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
    *   **Lower Risk/Steady Growth**: Look for 60% stocks and 40% bonds (e.g., VBAL, XBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
    *   **Conservative/Stability**: ETFs like VCNS or XCNS typically have 40% stocks and 60% bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.
*   **Importance**: Your risk tolerance and investment goals, not the ETF provider, should drive your decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Common Mistake: Filling out the investor questionnaire dishonestly can lead to choosing the wrong ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. An ETF that's too conservative might limit growth, while one that's too aggressive could cause panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. Take this step seriously to match your actual comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

### 2. Choose a Brokerage Account
You will need a brokerage account to purchase your ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

*   **Options in Canada**:
    *   **Well Simple Trade**: Offers zero commission fees and is suitable for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.
    *   **Questrade**: Also offers zero commission fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.
    *   **Big Bank Platforms**: Such as TD Direct Investing or RBC Direct Investing, are good for those who prefer existing bank platforms or convenience, but often involve higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Account Type**: Make sure to open the appropriate account type, such as a [[choosing_the_right_investment_accounts_in_canada | TFSA]], RRSP, or non-registered account, based on your investing goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

*   **General Steps**:
    1.  Log into your brokerage account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.
    2.  Search for the ETF using its ticker symbol (e.g., VGRO or ZBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.
    3.  Enter the number of shares you wish to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.
    4.  Choose between a market order (buys immediately at current price) or a limit order (sets a specific price you are willing to pay) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
    5.  Confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. You should receive a notification that the purchase is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Optional Step: Set Up a DRIP
A DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) automatically reinvests any dividends paid by your ETF into buying more shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.

*   **Benefits**: This helps compound your growth over time without extra effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.
*   **Activation**: Most brokerages allow you to enable DRIP in the settings or by contacting customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>.
*   **Automate Contributions**: For a hands-off approach, consider setting up automatic contributions from your paycheck each month into your all-in-one ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even though [[Benefits and Features of AllinOne ETFs | all-in-one ETFs are designed to make investing easy]], people often make mistakes that can hinder their returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

### 1. Getting Bored and Tweaking Too Much
The main advantage of all-in-one ETFs is their "set it and forget it" nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:58">[00:33:58]</a>.

*   **Patience is Key**: Constantly checking accounts, making unnecessary changes, or selling due to market swings can significantly hurt long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>.
*   **Expert Advice**: Economist Paul Samuelson advised that investing should be "more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

### 2. Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account
[[Common Mistakes to Avoid with AllinOne ETFs | Some investors]] combine multiple all-in-one ETFs or add other ETFs, believing it provides extra diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

*   **Built-in Diversification**: This practice often disrupts the built-in balance and complicates the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Sufficiency of One Fund**: All-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. Adding more funds can interfere with the carefully designed asset allocation and lead to unintended risk levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. For example, VGRO alone offers exposure to over 13,000 companies, providing ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Alternative Strategy**: If you wish to experiment beyond a single all-in-one ETF, consider using separate accounts for different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. For instance:
    *   **TFSA**: Keep it simple with a single all-in-one ETF like VGRO for long-term, tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
    *   **RRSP**: Build your own stock portfolio if you want to pick individual stocks, while keeping a portion passively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>.
    *   **Non-Registered Account**: Focus on tax-efficient ETFs like Horizon swap-based ETFs to minimize taxes on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>.

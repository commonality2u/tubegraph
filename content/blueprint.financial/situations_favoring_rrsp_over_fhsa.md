While the FHSA is often preferred over the RRSP in many cases, there are two key situations where the [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] still comes out on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Investing in US Stocks

If you plan on investing in US Stocks, the [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] is the smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. When US Stock dividends are earned in an FHSA, they are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can significantly reduce your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

However, with an [[investment_opportunities_in_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]], this tax is avoided entirely due to the US-Canada tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> Invest in US Stocks through your [[investment_opportunities_in_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]], not your FHSA, to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Employer Matching Contributions

Another significant advantage of the [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] is employer matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. If your employer offers to match your [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] contributions, this is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

For example, if an employer matches [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] contributions up to $5,000 per year, contributing $5,000 to your [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] would result in an additional $5,000 from your employer, totaling $10,000 in your [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

The FHSA currently does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Therefore, if you have access to an employer matching benefit at work, the [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] is the clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] takes the lead for long-term investors focused on US dividend stocks and individuals with strong work benefits that include employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These are the primary scenarios where prioritizing an [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] over an FHSA makes more sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

While the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is often considered the preferred account for home savings in Canada, there are two key situations where the [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_in_canada | Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)]] comes out on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. These primarily benefit long-term investors and those with strong work benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Investing in US Stocks

When investing in US Stocks, the [[comparison_between_tfsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] offers a distinct advantage over the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **FHSA Disadvantage**
    *   Any dividends earned from US stocks within an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This tax can significantly reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **RRSP Advantage**
    *   Thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, investments in US stocks held within an [[comparison_between_tfsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] are exempt from this 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> To avoid the 15% withholding tax on dividends from US stocks, invest in them through your [[comparison_between_tfsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] rather than your FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Employer Matching Contributions

Another significant benefit of the [[comparison_between_tfsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] is the potential for employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

*   **RRSP Advantage**
    *   If an employer offers to match [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_in_canada | RRSP]] contributions, this is essentially "free money" that can substantially boost retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   For example, if an employer matches up to $5,000 per year, a $5,000 contribution from an individual results in a total of $10,000 in their [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_in_canada | RRSP]] for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **FHSA Disadvantage**
    *   Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:25]</a>. If an employer matching benefit is available, the [[comparison_between_tfsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] is the clear winner in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:30]</a>.

In summary, while the FHSA often has more overall [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax advantages]] and flexibility for home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:58]</a>, prioritizing the [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_in_canada | RRSP]] makes more sense if investing heavily in US dividend stocks or if employer matching contributions are offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:09]</a>.

### 5. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

XDV is designed for investors seeking steady, high-quality dividends from strong Canadian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, selecting stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Key Features** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>:
    *   **Strong Dividend Payers**: Holds 31 of the highest-yielding Canadian stocks, selected for dividend consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions**: Provides monthly payouts, making it suitable for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   **Financials Heavy**: Nearly 60% of the ETF is composed of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>:
    *   **Dividend Yield**: Approximately 4.2% as of January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: 0.55% per year, which is higher than some alternatives but considered reasonable for a high-yield strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   **Assets Under Management (AUM)**: $1.76 billion, indicating its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: Dominated by Canadian financials (nearly 60%), including Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These companies have strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor**: Great for retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts and exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Not Ideal For**: Growth investors, as it prioritizes income over capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Summary**: XDV is a solid pick for dividend investors wanting monthly income and exposure to stable, high-yield Canadian companies, but its heavy reliance on financial stocks and moderate [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | fees]] should be noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

ZWC is an income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks and uses a covered call strategy to enhance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy provides higher monthly dividends but limits upside potential in stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.*   **How Covered Calls Work**: ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks, earning premiums. This boosts its dividend yield, but if stock prices rise above the strike price, ZWC must sell at the set price, missing out on bigger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Essentially, ZWC trades growth potential for more stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Key Features** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>:
    *   **Enhanced Income Strategy**: Uses covered calls to generate extra income, leading to a higher-than-average yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions**: Ideal for retirees or income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Diversified Canadian Portfolio**: Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
    *   **Dividend Yield**: 6.62% as of February 27, 2025, which is higher than average due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 12% return, but the 5-year average is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **MER**: 0.72%, higher than traditional dividend ETFs due to active options management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   **Trading Expense Ratio (TER)**: 0.20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   **Total Cost**: 0.92%, making it the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **AUM**: $1.7 billion, making it very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: Heavily weighted towards financials and energy, including Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotia Bank), CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. These are stable high-yield dividend payers, but the covered call strategy caps growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor**: Best for retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Good for RRSP and [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] investors who don't need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Not Ideal For**: Growth-focused investors, as covered calls limit potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Summary**: ZWC is a strong choice for investors wanting high monthly income with reduced market volatility, particularly retirees. Its covered call strategy limits upside potential, making it better suited for purely income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Holding it in a [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] can help shield the high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

    *   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 20.07% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   **MER**: 0.66% per year, slightly higher than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   **AUM**: $940 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings**: Less concentrated in financials compared to other dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Includes names like BCE, Allied Properties REIT, Fiera Capital, Telus, and Southcorp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversification]] can help reduce risk compared to bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Ideal Investor**: Great for dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Potentially more diversified than other bank-heavy dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Not Ideal For**: Maximum yield seekers, as its dividend rate is lower than some other ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Summary**: CDZ is a great choice for long-term investors who value steady dividend growth and broad sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Its focus on companies with strong dividend track records makes it a reliable option for sustainable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Pro Tip**: For all ETFs on this list, setting up a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) can supercharge long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Why Canadian Dividend ETFs Aren't Always Ideal

While [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | dividend ETFs]] can be convenient, they have notable downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Higher Fees

[[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | Dividend ETFs]] often come with higher-than-average Management Expense Ratios (MERs), which can significantly erode returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. For instance, XDV charges 0.55% MER but only holds 31 stocks, which is not considered great [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversification]] for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. To counteract this, it's advised to find dividend ETFs with lower MERs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Limited Diversification

Most [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] are heavily concentrated in financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For example, VDY has over 85% exposure to just financials and energy, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Similarly, XDV holds only 31 stocks and XQD only 20 stocks, meaning they don't offer broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

This contrasts with truly [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversified ETFs]] like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO), which holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For true [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversification]], [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | dividend ETFs]] alone might not suffice; building a custom portfolio or choosing a globally [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversified ETF]] might be better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### US Dividend Stocks as an Alternative

Many of the best dividend stocks are in the US market, often offering higher dividend growth rates, more sector [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversification]], and more blue-chip companies with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Instead of paying ETF [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | fees]], investors might consider directly investing in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Another [[alternative_investment_strategies_to_dividend_etfs | strategy]] could be to combine a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip**: For US dividend stocks, consider holding them in an RRSP rather than a [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] to avoid withholding tax on the dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Ultimately, [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] can be a convenient tool for investors who prefer not to select individual stocks, but concerns like high [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | fees]], lack of [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | diversification]], and reduced control remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Non-registered accounts serve as the final destination for [[investment_strategies for beginners | investments]] after maximizing contributions to your FHSA, TFSA, and RSP accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While they lack the tax advantages of registered accounts, it is still possible to grow wealth effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Ideal Assets for Non-Registered Accounts
To minimize taxes in non-registered accounts, focus on specific asset types:

*   **Growth Stocks with No Dividends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
    *   Avoid interest income, which is taxed at the highest possible rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Examples include Shopify, Nvidia, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   Capital gains from these stocks are taxed at a lower rate and only when the assets are sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   Always perform due diligence before investing in higher-risk growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

*   **Canadian Dividend Stocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
    *   These stocks allow you to take advantage of the Canadian dividend tax credit, which helps lower taxes on eligible dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
    *   For example, a $1,000 dividend is "grossed up" to $1,380 for tax purposes, resulting in a 15% federal tax credit that reduces your taxes by $207 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Provincial credits also provide further tax relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Assets to Avoid in Non-Registered Accounts
*   **US Dividend Paying Stocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>
    *   These stocks face withholding taxes and do not qualify for the Canadian dividend tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Priority in Overall Investment Strategy
Non-registered accounts should be considered last in your [[choosing the right investment accounts in Canada | investment account prioritization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The recommended order of priority for [[taxefficient investment strategies in Canada | tax-efficient investment strategies in Canada]], if you qualify for each account, is:
1.  RDSP (Registered Disability Savings Plan) due to generous government grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
2.  RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) with employer matching for free employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
3.  RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan) for education savings with a 20% government match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
4.  FHSA (First Home Savings Account) for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
5.  RSP or [[taxfree_savings_account_strategies | TFSA]] depending on income and flexibility needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
6.  Finally, non-registered accounts, focusing on growth or Canadian dividend stocks for tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

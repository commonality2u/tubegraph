Many Canadians believe that the [[cpp_benefits_at_ages_60_65_and_70 | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and [[old_age_security_pension_and_its_implications | Old Age Security (OAS)]] will be sufficient for their retirement, but relying solely on these benefits can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For very low-income seniors, the [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] can provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## What is the Guaranteed Income Supplement?
The [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] is a government benefit specifically designed to help very low-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Eligibility Criteria
To qualify for the [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]], your total income must be very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It is available to Canadians aged 65 and older who meet specific income thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Benefit Amounts
The maximum [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] you could receive in 2024 is $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Income Impact on GIS
*   **Reduction Formula**: If you have any additional income, your [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] benefit is reduced dollar for dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **RRSPs**: Even small withdrawals from Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) can impact your [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **OAS Exemption**: It's important to note that your [[old_age_security_pension_and_its_implications | Old Age Security (OAS)]] pension does *not* count towards the [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Example of Total Income with GIS
For a senior with no other income sources, a potential monthly retirement income could include:
*   [[cpp_benefits_at_ages_60_65_and_70 | CPP]]: Approximately $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   [[old_age_security_pension_and_its_implications | OAS]]: Approximately $700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]]: Potentially $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total Monthly Income**: Approximately $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

While qualifying for [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] can bring your total income to around $2,000 per month, this amount is considered barely above the poverty line in Canada, indicating that relying solely on [[cpp_benefits_at_ages_60_65_and_70 | CPP]], [[old_age_security_pension_and_its_implications | OAS]], and [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] may not provide a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

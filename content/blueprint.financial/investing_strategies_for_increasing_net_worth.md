To understand [[strategies for increasing personal net worth using data | strategies for increasing personal net worth]], it's helpful to define what constitutes the top wealth tier. As of 2021, the threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is owning assets of at least $6.3 million [02:20:00]. This group comprises approximately 160,000 families in Canada who have achieved this level of wealth [02:40:00].

## How to Increase Your Net Worth

Achieving a high net worth, particularly becoming part of the top 1%, can be approached through several key [[strategies for improving financial position across different wealth classes | strategies]]:

### 1. High-Paying Profession
One path to increasing net worth is through a high-paying profession, which allows for substantial savings and investment. The income threshold for the top 1% in Canada is around $271,500 per year [02:58:00]. Professions that can help achieve this include:
*   C-Suite level executives (CEO, CFO, CTO) [03:26:00]
*   Medical specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons) [03:33:00]
*   Partners in law and accounting firms [03:38:00]
*   Investment bankers [03:40:00]
*   Principal software engineers [03:42:00]
*   Senior data scientists [03:43:00]
*   Specialized dentists [03:44:00]
*   Senior software architects [03:47:00]

However, many of these roles require extensive specialized education and work experience [04:01:00]. Even within sales roles, such as real estate agents, mortgage brokers, or pharmaceutical sales representatives, high incomes can be achieved through commissions and bonuses, acting as a hybrid between salary and business ownership [05:36:00]. These [[strategies to increase personal income | strategies to increase personal income]] provide the capital needed for wealth accumulation.

### 2. Starting a Business
Business ownership is a primary method for the wealthiest Canadians to accumulate wealth [04:19:00]. Businesses offer significant financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits (selling or going public) [05:05:00]. The key advantage of a business is its ability to scale, reaching hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers [05:17:00]. Notable examples include Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify, whose e-commerce platform propelled him into Canada's elite wealth [04:47:00].

### 3. Investing Wisely
Investing is crucial for allowing money to compound and grow over time [06:45:00]. Even with a high income, foolish investment choices can hinder wealth accumulation [06:39:00].

> Annuity Shabber, an IRS auditor, retired with modest savings but built a $22 million fortune by investing her savings in blue-chip companies with solid dividends [06:51:00]. Her strategy of buying and holding high-quality stocks long-term paid off significantly [07:11:00].

For beginners, [[key investment strategies and options | diversification]] is a good starting point, spreading investments across various asset classes [07:20:00].

#### Investment Options and Strategies
*   **Stock Market**: A powerful strategy is investing in the stock market [07:26:00].
    *   **Hands-off approach**: Consider index funds or ETFs with low fees, as these track market indices and offer broad diversification [07:30:00].
    *   **Active approach**: Learn to pick individual stocks to be more involved [07:41:00].
*   **Fixed Income/Bonds**: To reduce risk, consider investing in fixed income or bonds to complement stock holdings [07:46:00]. A mix of Canadian stocks and bonds can provide steady growth and protect against market volatility [07:51:00].
*   **Real Estate**: Real estate is a major wealth builder for Canadians and a common asset in millionaire portfolios [07:59:00]. Investing in rental properties can provide steady income and property value appreciation [08:10:00].

#### Tax-Advantaged Accounts
Maximize returns by utilizing tax-advantaged accounts, which offer benefits that enhance investment growth [08:18:00].
*   **RSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans)**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal [08:27:00].
*   **TFSAs (Tax-Free Savings Accounts)**: Investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free [08:35:00].
*   **FHSAs (First Home Savings Accounts)**: Also offer tax benefits [08:24:00].

### 4. Frugality and Saving
Living frugally and consistently saving a significant portion of income can lead to substantial wealth accumulation [08:45:00].

> [!example] Success Story
> Ronald Reed, a janitor and gas station attendant, built an $8 million fortune by living frugally and consistently investing in blue-chip stocks like Proctor & Gamble, JP Morgan Chase, and General Electric over several decades [08:50:00]. He reinvested dividends, demonstrating the power of long-term investing even with a low income [09:12:00].

It's important to balance frugality with quality of life to avoid "extreme frugality" that negatively impacts well-being and relationships [09:31:00]. This approach highlights [[retirement_savings_growth_strategies | retirement savings growth strategies]] and how consistent, long-term saving and investing can lead to significant wealth.

## Combining Strategies
These methods are not mutually exclusive; most wealthy individuals combine several approaches [09:53:00]. For instance:
*   A high-paying job can be combined with wise investing and frugality [10:08:00].
*   Those who enjoy risk can start a scalable business and invest profits wisely [10:15:00].
*   Individuals facing high expenses (e.g., with kids) can focus on increasing their salary through promotions or training, and then invest any excess income [10:26:00].

Finding the best approach depends on individual lifestyle and needs [11:01:00]. A solid financial plan is essential for anyone aiming to become wealthier than 99% of Canadians [11:10:00].

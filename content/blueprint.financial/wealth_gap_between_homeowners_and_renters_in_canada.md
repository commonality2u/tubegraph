A significant wealth gap exists between homeowners and renters in Canada, a disparity largely driven by [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate]] appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:32">[02:31:32]</a>.

## Current Disparity

In 2024, homeowners in Canada had an average net worth of $1.38 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. This figure is nearly five times higher than that of renters, who averaged $274,000 in net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. The extent of this difference, exceeding $1 million, has been described as shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:15">[02:13:15]</a>.

## Growth Trends (2020-2024)

Both groups experienced steady growth in net worth from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>:
*   Homeowners saw a 33% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:26">[02:25:26]</a>.
*   Renters' net worth grew by 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>.

Despite similar percentage growth rates, the substantial difference in initial wealth means the absolute wealth gap continues to widen.

## Driving Factors

The primary reason for this wealth disparity is the appreciation of [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:32">[02:31:32]</a>. [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | Real estate]] constitutes over 50% of Canadian household net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. This highlights how much Canadians rely on property to build and store wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.

For homeowners, [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate]] ownership significantly boosts their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:36">[02:34:36]</a>. Renters, having little exposure to [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate]], primarily build wealth through financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:38">[02:37:38]</a>. The challenges in accessing the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | Canadian housing market]] may further prevent one-person households (and by extension, many renters) from affording property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:34">[05:32:34]</a>.

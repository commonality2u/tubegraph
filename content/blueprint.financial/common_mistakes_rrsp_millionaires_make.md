Even successful Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) holders often make a significant mistake: they focus on growing their RRSP without planning how to withdraw from it tax-efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This oversight can lead to paying far more in taxes during retirement than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## The Overlooked Exit Strategy

The core issue is that RRSPs are tax-deferred, not tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While contributions lower taxable income today, every dollar withdrawn is subject to tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Without a proper withdrawal strategy, individuals risk withdrawing large sums at high tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, or leaving their heirs with a substantial tax bill upon the RRSP holder's death, as the RRSP is fully taxed at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Most retirees unknowingly lose tens of thousands of dollars in taxes due to improper RRSP withdrawal planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Strategies to Mitigate the Mistake

Several approaches can help mitigate this common mistake and ensure more wealth is retained in retirement:

*   **Early Withdrawals**
    Consider starting early withdrawals to spread out taxable income and avoid tax spikes when Registered Income Fund (RIF) withdrawals begin after age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **Fund Shifting**
    Shift funds into a [[TFSA]] (Tax-Free Savings Account) to allow investments to continue growing tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

*   **Income Coordination**
    Coordinate RRSP withdrawals with other income sources like Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) to avoid higher tax brackets and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

*   **Estate Planning**
    For estate planning, life insurance policies can help offset the tax burden, ensuring more wealth remains with the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

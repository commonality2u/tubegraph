Many Canadians are considering leaving Canada due to factors like high taxes, inflation, and freezing winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 2022, the number of Canadians moving to the U.S. alone reached 126,340 people, a 70% increase from 75,752 people in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It's estimated that approximately 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad in 2016, and this number has likely grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Why Canadians are Moving Abroad

Several reasons drive Canadians to seek life elsewhere:
*   **Rising Cost of Living** The main driver is the increasing cost of living, particularly in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where housing prices have significantly risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Moving to countries such as Mexico, Portugal, or parts of the United States can lead to a lower cost of living with more affordable housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Harsh Winters** Canada's severe winters, with temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, prompt many to look for milder climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Healthcare System Challenges** Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces issues like long wait times for medical services and a low doctor-to-population ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Commonwealth Fund ranks Canada poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Adventure and New Experiences** Living abroad offers opportunities for adventure, immersing oneself in new cultures, cuisines, and ways of life, fostering personal growth and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Steps to Prepare for Moving Abroad

### Step 1: Make Sure You Want to Leave Canada

Before making the definitive move, a trial run is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Spend a few weeks or months living in the country (or countries) you're considering, trying to live as much like a local as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This [[researching_and_adapting_to_a_new_country | hands-on experience]] provides important insights and can either confirm your decision or reveal that the new country isn't the right fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

You might discover that the new country is not as safe as you'd prefer, or its culture feels too closed off, making it difficult to form connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. You may also miss friends, family, or even aspects of Canadian life like the healthcare system and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This trial period helps you assess [[safety_and_cultural_considerations_for_canadians_moving_internationally | safety and cultural considerations]].

### Step 2: Making Money Abroad

Unless you are financially independent, you will need a way to earn income while living overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Here are three common paths:

*   **Expat through Company Transfer**
    *   **Process**: Seek international opportunities within your current company, express interest to HR, and network with colleagues who have experience working abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Understand the legal and logistical aspects of the move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Offers job security, continuity of benefits, and career boosting international experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Companies often provide relocation assistance and support networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
    *   **Drawbacks**: May offer less flexibility over location and work assignments, requires adapting to a new work culture, and usually demands a longer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Remote Work**
    *   **Process**: Find jobs on websites like remote.co, weworkremotely, and flexjobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Set up a home office with reliable internet, a comfortable workspace, and necessary tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Manage time effectively using tools like Trello or Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Provides flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection, saving time and money on commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   **Drawbacks**: Can be isolating without office social interaction, requires high self-motivation and time management, and may offer less job security and fewer benefits than full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Remote workers are often in software or IT, but can also be in HR, sales, or even law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Digital Nomad**
    *   **Process**: Develop a portable skill or service (e.g., freelance writing, graphic design, programming, consulting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Build a portfolio online (personal website, Behance, LinkedIn) and find clients on freelance platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Offers freedom to travel and experience new cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Working for multiple clients can be more stable than relying on a single job, and it fosters personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Drawbacks**: Income can be unpredictable, balancing work and travel can be challenging, and [[visa_options_for_canadians_moving_abroad | navigating visas and work permits]] can be complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Digital nomads may also tire of not having a permanent home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Digital nomads engage in diverse fields such as digital marketing, startups, content creation, and even therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Step 3: Becoming a Non-Resident of Canada

To become a non-resident of Canada for tax purposes, you must sever significant residential ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This includes selling your home, closing bank accounts, and relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The most significant factor is where you spend your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. You'll need to keep documentation of your new residency status, such as rental agreements and utility bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

Be aware of the [[navigating_departure_and_exit_taxes_for_canadians_moving_abroad | departure tax]], which applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. You'll need to pay tax on the unrealized gains of your investments and real estate, though RRSPs, RRIFs, and certain real estate are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. These deemed dispositions must be reported on your final tax return, and any capital gains tax on unrealized gains must be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

Your TFSA can remain open, but you cannot make contributions while a non-resident, though earnings within it will still be tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. You can keep your RRSP and RRIF accounts, but withdrawals will be subject to a 25% withholding tax, which may be reducible by tax treaties depending on your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

You can continue receiving [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | CPP payments abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. For OAS, you'll be eligible to receive payments outside of Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Step 4: Understanding Your New Country's Rules

Understanding the rules of your new country can be challenging, especially with potential distance and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. To ensure a smooth transition, figure out the following [[key_factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | key factors]]:

*   **Residency and Tax Laws**: Research the residency requirements, including applying for temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Some countries require address registration upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident and investigate tax treaties with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Visa Laws**: Understand the different [[visa_options_for_canadians_moving_abroad | visa options]] and choose the one that fits your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Familiarize yourself with required documents, timelines, and conditions (e.g., work, study, length of stay), and know the procedures for visa renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Learn how to open a local bank account by choosing a reputable bank and preparing necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Understand the local currency, exchange rates, and banking system to ensure access to your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Other Important Regulations**:
    *   **Healthcare**: Learn about the healthcare system and whether you need to purchase health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Driving**: Understand local driving laws and requirements, including the need for international driving permits or converting your Canadian license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   **Legal Requirements**: Learn about local laws and emergency services to avoid legal issues and ensure your safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Step 5: Explore Getting Citizenship Elsewhere

Securing citizenship in a new country offers benefits such as stability, access to local services, and full community integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Common pathways include:

*   **Citizenship by Naturalization**: Typically involves living and working in a country for a specific period (e.g., 5 years in Germany) while meeting language and integration requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This process generally requires continuous residency, compliance with local laws, and often passing a language test or demonstrating cultural integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Investment**: Countries grant citizenship in exchange for significant financial investments (e.g., purchasing real estate worth at least $400,000 in Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. The process involves making the required investment, providing proof of funds, and meeting any additional residency or legal requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Relatives and Ancestry**: If you have parents, grandparents, or sometimes even great-grandparents from another country, you might be eligible for citizenship by descent (e.g., Italian citizenship through Italian ancestry, or Irish citizenship with an Irish grandparent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This typically involves gathering relevant certificates (birth, marriage records) and submitting them to the consulate or embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Other Ways**: Marrying a citizen from another country can often speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Some countries, like the UAE, grant citizenships for exceptional skills in fields such as science or culture, usually involving a nomination or application demonstrating contributions or skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Bonus Tip: Researching the Cost of Living

To quickly estimate the cost of living in a new country, use the website Numbeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
1.  Go to Numbeo's cost of living comparison menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  Type in your current city (e.g., Toronto) and the city you want to move to (e.g., Mexico City) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
3.  Click "compare" to see a breakdown of different cost comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. For example, the cost of living in Mexico City is 37% lower than in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
4.  You can drill down into specific costs, such as restaurant prices, which might be almost 40% cheaper in Mexico City than in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

While Numbeo's data is user-generated, it is generally accurate for popular cities and provides a good ballpark estimate for costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

If you are seriously considering moving countries, it is highly recommended to talk to a cross-border tax specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

[[overcontributing_to_tfsa | Overcontributing]] to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can lead to significant penalties from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04">[02:04]</a>. This is considered a common tax filing mistake that can be quite costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01">[02:01]</a>.

## Penalties for Overcontributing

*   **RRSP Overcontributions** Excess RRSP contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty on the overcontributed amount until it is withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>.
*   **TFSA Overcontributions** [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | TFSA]] contributions that exceed the limit also incur a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13">[02:13]</a>.

These penalties accumulate silently, as the CRA does not automatically notify taxpayers of [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontributions]] to an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>.

## Causes of Overcontribution Mistakes

[[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_mistakes | Overcontribution mistakes]] often occur because taxpayers do not diligently track their available contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>. It's a common misconception that the CRA will issue a warning for [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24">[02:24]</a>.

## How to Avoid Overcontribution Penalties

To [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_mistakes | avoid]] [[cra_penalties_and_taxes_on_tfsa | penalties]] and [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | taxes]] on [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontributions]]:

1.  **Track Contributions Carefully** Do not rely solely on your My CRA account for up-to-date contribution room, as it may not be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>. Maintain your own records of contributions to stay within limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35">[02:35]</a>.
2.  **Act Fast if Overcontributed** If you realize you have [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontributed]], withdraw the excess funds as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42">[02:42]</a>. Prompt action can help minimize the [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | penalties]] and prevent further tax complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> You are permitted to exceed your RRSP limit by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52">[02:52]</a>. This provides a small buffer for RRSP contributions, but no such buffer exists for TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58">[02:58]</a>.

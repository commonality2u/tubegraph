In 2019, the website WealthAwesome.com was launched with a financial goal of making $3,000 per month and attracting 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This goal was not only met but exceeded by almost 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article details the adventure of starting and eventually selling Wealth Awesome.

## Why Start a Finance Blog?

Several key motivations led to the creation of Wealth Awesome:
*   **Dream of Digital Nomadism**: The creator aspired to be a digital nomad, someone with an online income source that allows for global travel and remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Having spent time backpacking in Asia, the desire for such a lifestyle was strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Creating a Positive Impact**: A strong desire to create something that would be a "net positive in the world" and help educate Canadians on finance was a driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The creator wanted to work on something that provided a sense of purpose and joy by helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: After gaining experience writing for Canadian media and investment publications like CTV News and building a readership of tens of thousands per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, a friend suggested starting a personal financial education site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Observing existing Canadian financial blogs, the creator felt capable of producing equally good or better content, leveraging significant education and experience in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This identified a market opportunity to create great content and share the digital nomad journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The site officially launched in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## [[Earning money through blogging | Earning Income from the Site]]

[[Earning money through blogging | Earning money through blogging]] was not an immediate process; the first dollar was earned about a year after the site's inception, in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This was a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade, received after writing over 150 articles and spending hundreds of hours on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Revenue Milestones & Totals
The initial goal of earning $3,000 per month was achieved in February 2021, approximately a year and a half after the site started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. At its peak, the site earned over $20,000 per month, nearly reaching $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In total, the website generated over $500,000, excluding the undisclosed sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Income Generation Methods
Income was primarily generated through:
*   **Advertising**: After reaching a certain traffic threshold (50,000 visitors per month at the time), the site could apply for premium ad networks like Mediavine (which later lowered its requirement to 10,000 visitors per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille/1,000 visitors), with finance content having high RPMs, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions**: This involves earning money by recommending and referring products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The creator only recommended products personally believed in and used, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Commissions typically ranged from $50 to $100, sometimes more (e.g., $150-$200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Website Traffic Growth
The site's traffic started slow, with traction only beginning after writing about 100 articles and 11 months into the journey, reaching approximately 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, traffic rapidly increased:
*   By January 2021, it had tenfold to 50,000 visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   The site peaked at around 250,000 visitors per month in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   In total, Wealth Awesome received about 5 million visitors over the years, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   A linked YouTube channel also grew to nearly 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Lessons Learned
Starting and running the site provided invaluable experience:
*   **Technical Skills**: Learned website design and building, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), writing, graphic creation, and website data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Business Acumen**: Gained experience in building an affiliate partner network, monetizing a website, hiring and managing people, and utilizing numerous online business tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience**: Previous roles as an analyst aided in SEO and outreach data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Business-to-business sales experience helped promote the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Experience as a [[Financial planning for retirement | financial advisor]] enabled writing useful content and deeper audience connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Personal Growth & Mental Toughness**: Running a business taught resilience to ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. It became clear that not everything can be controlled, but one can control their reaction to challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck**: The site's launch just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending more time online and interested in personal finance, proved to be fortuitous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Why the Site Was Sold
The decision to sell Wealth Awesome stemmed from several factors:
*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the creator lost passion for the project, finding it difficult to stay motivated and excited about producing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This highlighted a valuable lesson: when the "fire" is gone, it might be time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty about the Future**: Concerns about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates created stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Serendipitous Opportunity**: The site was sold randomly when a trusted friend and former colleague, Q, who was building a portfolio of digital assets, approached the creator about buying Wealth Awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The deal was finalized within a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## New Endeavors
Moving on from Wealth Awesome, the creator launched a new financial planning company called Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This venture focuses on building customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This new path aligns with personal values and skills, as the creator believes most people have not optimized their finances and significant value can be brought to individuals and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The previous experience as a [[Financial planning for retirement | financial advisor]] was a favorite role due to the intimate one-on-one connections formed and the personal satisfaction derived from helping people reach their [[Setting and automating financial goals | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The journey with Wealth Awesome allowed the creator to live in various interesting places, including Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bali, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines, the US, Canada, and Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This experience led to meeting many interesting people and making a real impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

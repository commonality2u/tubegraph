## How to Set and Automate Your Goals

Here's a guide to setting and automating your financial goals:

### 1. Define Your Goals
Make your goals specific and measurable for the year ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Examples include:
*   Paying off $6,000 in credit card debt by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Saving $5,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Building a $15,000 emergency fund, equivalent to six months of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Contributing the full $7,000 TFSA limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Contributing a portion to your RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### 2. Break Goals into Milestones
Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable milestones to maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   For a $12,000 vacation saving goal, target $1,000 per month or $250 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   For $6,000 in debt repayment, aim for $500 monthly or $125 weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Remember to celebrate your achievements to stay motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### 3. Automate Your Contributions
Set up automatic contributions to ensure consistent progress toward your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Savings:** Set up automatic transfers to a high-interest savings account or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Investments:** Utilize pre-authorized contributions for RSPs, FHSA, or other investment accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This includes [[automation_in_rrsp_savings | automation in RRSP savings]].
*   **Debt Repayment:** Schedule regular payments to reduce balances and avoid late fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

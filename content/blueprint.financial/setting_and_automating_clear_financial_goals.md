Setting clear financial goals and automating contributions provides purpose and direction for your financial plan, acting as a blueprint to help you prioritize and stay on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Automation ensures consistent progress by removing the need for constant decision-making, which reduces procrastination and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## How to Set and Automate Your Goals

### 1. Define Your Goals

Make your financial goals specific and measurable for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Examples include:
*   Paying off $6,000 in credit card debt by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Saving $5,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Building a $15,000 emergency fund, which represents six months of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Contributing the full $7,000 TFSA limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Contributing a portion to your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### 2. Break Goals into Milestones

Divide your larger goals into smaller, manageable milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. For example:
*   Instead of saving $12,000 for a vacation, aim for $1,000 per month or $250 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   For $6,000 in debt repayment, target $500 monthly or $125 weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
Celebrating these smaller wins helps maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### 3. Automate Your Contributions

Schedule automatic transfers to ensure consistent progress towards your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>:
*   **Savings:** Set up automatic transfers to a high-interest savings account or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Investments:** Utilize pre-authorized contributions for RRSPS, FHSAs, or other investment accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Debt Repayment:** Schedule regular payments to reduce balances and avoid late fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Schedule contributions right after payday to prioritize savings and prevent spending the funds elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This helps to cultivate financial discipline and builds wealth and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

The year 2025 is bringing significant tax changes in Canada, and understanding these [[updates_on_tax_credits_for_2025 | updates]] can help maximize tax savings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> These changes are categorized into investment and real estate, household, pension and retiree tax, and [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | business owner tax changes]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP)

In 2025, the RSP contribution limit has increased to $32,490, up from $31,560 in 2024. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> This limit allows individuals to contribute up to 18% of their earned income, capped at this new maximum. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> Those earning $180,500 or more will reach the maximum contribution limit, while for others, the maximum contributions will be 18% of their income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

### Home Buyer's Plan (HBP)

Related to the RSP, the Home Buyer's Plan (HBP) withdrawal limit has increased from $35,000 to $60,000 per person, or $120,000 per couple, for an RSP down payment withdrawal towards a home. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> Additionally, the repayment grace period for withdrawals has been extended from 2 years to 5 years, giving buyers more time before starting RSP repayments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> For instance, a first-time home-buying couple, Alex and Jamie, can each withdraw $60,000 from their RSPs for a combined $120,000 down payment, benefiting from the extended 5-year grace period for repayment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

## Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

In 2025, the annual TFSA contribution limit remains at $7,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> This is the same increase as the 2024 limit, allowing for a total of $92,000 in contributions if one has qualified since the TFSA's inception in 2009. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> Any unused contribution room carries forward indefinitely, enabling individuals to catch up in future years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is a registered plan designed to help first-time home buyers in Canada save up to $40,000 tax-free towards purchasing their first home. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> You can contribute up to $8,000 per year, and any unused contribution room can be carried forward, provided an FHSA has been opened. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

To open an FHSA, you must be a first-time home buyer, meaning you have not owned a home in the current or previous four calendar years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> It is encouraged to open an FHSA as early as possible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> For example, opening an FHSA by December 31st of the current year grants $8,000 in contribution room for the next year, and another $8,000 on January 1st of the following year, totaling $16,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> Delaying can result in missing out on valuable accumulating contribution room. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>

> [!TIP] Pro Tip
> Even if the funds in your FHSA are not used to purchase a home, the unused balance can be transferred to an RSP or RRIF after 15 years without affecting your combined RSP contribution room. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> Combining the FHSA with the HBP can allow a couple to save up to $200,000 for their home purchase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>

## Capital Gains Inclusion Rate Adjustments

This is one of the most significant changes for the year, requiring careful planning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

### For Individuals

For individuals, the first $250,000 of net capital gains in a year is taxed similar to before, with 50% of the gains being taxable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a> However, any net capital gains exceeding $250,000 in the same year will have a higher inclusion rate, with 66.67% (or 2/3) of those gains being taxable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

> [!EXAMPLE] Example for Individuals
> If Jason made $300,000 in net capital gains this year:
> *   The first $250,000 is taxed at the usual 50% rate, adding $125,000 to his taxable income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
> *   The remaining $50,000 is taxed at the new higher inclusion rate of 66.67%, adding about $33,333 to his taxable income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
> *   In total, approximately $158,000 would be added to his taxable income from these capital gains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>

These changes are mainly aimed at individuals with substantial capital gains; most Canadians with less than $250,000 in annual capital gains will not be affected by the increased rate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> One area significantly affected by this change is estate planning, making it more crucial than ever to shield estates from these capital gains taxes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>

### For Corporations

The tax structure for [[capital_gains_tax_changes_for_corporations | capital gains for corporations]] has been revised. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> Previously, 50% of a corporation's capital gains were included in taxable income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a> Under the new rules, this inclusion rate has increased to 66.67%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>

> [!EXAMPLE] Example for Corporations
> If ABC Corp realizes a capital gain of $200,000, with the new inclusion rate, two-thirds of it (approximately $133,000) is added to the corporation's taxable income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>

Unlike individuals, the new capital gains inclusion rate for corporations starts at $1, not $250,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> This will require more careful planning for [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | business owners]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>

### Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) allows individuals to exclude a portion of capital gains from taxation upon the sale of qualified small business corporation shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a> As of 2025, the LCGE limit has significantly increased to $1.25 million, up from $1.01 million in 2024. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a> For example, selling a qualified small business for $1.2 million could result in all capital gains being exempt from taxes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>

> [!TIP] Pro Tip
> The LCGE applies to each individual shareholder, meaning if multiple shareholders dispose of shares, each can potentially claim the exemption on their respective gains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>

### Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)

The Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI) aims to support entrepreneurs by reducing the capital gains inclusion rate to 1/3 on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a> The incentive is being phased in, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching $2 million by 2029. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a> For example, a small business owner selling their enterprise with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would include only one-third of that in their taxable income under the CEI, compared to two-thirds without the incentive, potentially resulting in tax savings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>

Tax planning involves staying ahead of the curve and understanding the rules. These updates are a reminder to revisit your [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | strategy]] for minimizing taxes and growing investments, as small adjustments now can lead to major wins later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>

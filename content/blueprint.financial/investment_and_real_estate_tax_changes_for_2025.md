2025 brings several significant tax updates in Canada that will impact investments and real estate, aiming to help individuals maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These changes are broken down into key categories, starting with investment and real estate adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP)
The RSP contribution limit for 2025 has increased to $32,490, up from $31,560 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This limit allows contributions of up to 18% of earned income, capped at the new maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Individuals earning $180,500 or more will reach this maximum contribution limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For those earning less, the maximum contribution remains 18% of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
The HBP withdrawal limit has significantly increased from $35,000 to $60,000 per person, or $120,000 per couple, for an RSP down payment withdrawal towards a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Additionally, the repayment grace period has been extended from 2 years to 5 years for withdrawals, providing buyers with more time before starting RSP repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   **Example:** Alex and Jamie, as first-time home buyers, each withdraw $60,000 from their RSPs, combining for a $120,000 down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. With the extended 5-year grace period, they have increased flexibility to manage their finances before repayment begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)
In 2025, the annual TFSA contribution limit remains at $7,000, consistent with the 2024 limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. If an individual has qualified since the TFSA's inception in 2009, the total cumulative limit is $12,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Any unused contribution room carries forward indefinitely, allowing individuals to catch up in future years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)
The FHSA is a registered plan designed to help first-time home buyers in Canada save up to $40,000 tax-free towards purchasing their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Individuals can contribute up to $8,000 per year, and any unused contribution room can be carried forward, provided an FHSA has been opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

To open an FHSA, an individual must be a first-time home buyer, meaning they have not owned a home in the current or previous four calendar years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip:** It is encouraged to open an FHSA as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Opening an FHSA by December 31st of the current year grants $8,000 in contribution room for the next year, and another $8,000 on January 1st of the following year, totaling $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Delaying this action can result in missing out on valuable accumulated contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip:** Even if the funds in an FHSA are not used to purchase a home, the unused balance can be transferred to an RSP or RRIF after 15 years without affecting the combined RSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   Combining the FHSA with the HBP allows a couple to save up to $200,000 for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Capital Gains Inclusion Rate Adjustments
The [[potential_outcomes_for_canadas_capital_gains_tax | capital gains inclusion rate]] has been adjusted, requiring careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For individuals, the first $250,000 of net capital gains in a year will continue to be taxed as before, with 50% of the gains being taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, any net capital gains exceeding $250,000 in the same year will be subject to a higher inclusion rate, with 66.67% (or 2/3) of those gains being taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

*   **Example:** Jason realized $300,000 in net capital gains this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The first $250,000 is taxed at the usual 50% rate, adding $125,000 to his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The remaining $50,000 is taxed at the new higher inclusion rate of 66.67%, adding approximately $33,333 to his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In total, about $158,000 would be added to his taxable income from these capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

These changes are primarily aimed at individuals with substantial capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Most Canadians who typically have less than $250,000 in capital gains annually will not be affected by the increased rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This change will, however, significantly affect estate planning, making it more important to shield estates from these capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The [[capital_gains_tax_update_for_corporations_in_2025 | capital gains changes for business owners]] will be more impactful for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

[[spousal_rrsp_contributions | Spousal RRSP contributions]] offer a straightforward yet effective method to distribute the tax burden in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. This strategy is particularly beneficial for balancing retirement incomes, especially if one partner has a workplace pension or if there's a significant age difference between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. It helps level the playing field, allowing both partners to maximize their savings and reduce overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

## How it Works
A higher-income spouse contributes to an RRSP in the lower-income spouse's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

1.  **Immediate Tax Deduction**: The contributing spouse receives an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
2.  **Future Tax Efficiency**: When the lower-income spouse withdraws the funds in retirement, they are taxed at their lower marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

The core idea is to predict which spouse will have a lower income in retirement and then use [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSPs]] to capitalize on that fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## Example: Ted and Robin's Retirement Plan
Consider Ted and Robin's retirement planning scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>:
*   **Ted**: Earns $120,000 annually, taxed at 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Robin**: Earns $40,000 annually, taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Their goal is to equalize their retirement savings, especially since Ted has a workplace pension and Robin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

### The Strategy
Ted contributes $12,000 to a [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]] in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Results
*   **Immediate Deduction**: Ted's contribution lowers his taxable income, resulting in an immediate tax saving of $4,200 (35% of $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Future Tax Efficiency**: When Robin eventually withdraws the funds, she pays only $2,400 in taxes (20% of $12,000), because her tax rate is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Net Household Savings**: By shifting income to Robin's lower tax bracket, the household achieves a net tax saving of $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

## Pro Tips for Spousal RRSPs
*   **Avoid Early Withdrawals**: If the funds are withdrawn by Robin within three years of Ted's contribution, the withdrawal amount will be attributed back to Ted and taxed at his higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.
*   **Plan for Equal Balances**: Aim to achieve equal RRSP balances between spouses to prevent uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
*   **Consider Age Differences**: If there's a significant age gap between spouses, plan contributions carefully to ensure balanced withdrawals throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees (aged 65 and over) was $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which translates to $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The largest portions of expenditures for retirees in Canada are allocated as follows:

*   **Shelter**
    *   Largest portion, including accommodation costs and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Retirees spend approximately $13,814 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, or $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   This accounts for about 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Despite many retirees owning their homes, they still incur significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**
    *   Retirees spend about $7,667 annually on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, averaging $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   This makes up 12.4% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> and includes groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation**
    *   Generally lower than for younger people, but still represents 8.8% of the monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**
    *   Even with free healthcare in Canada, healthcare costs see a higher allocation due to increased medical needs as people age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   This accounts for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**
    *   Takes up 5.4% of monthly spending, highlighting the need for continued [[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | financial security]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**
    *   Includes expenses for maintaining the home and accounts for 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## How Spending Changes Throughout Life

Household [[impact_of_age_on_retirement_spending_patterns | spending patterns]] evolve significantly with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>:

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54)**
    *   Spending is at its highest peak, averaging $102,646 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   This rise is driven by higher family needs like larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there is a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64)**
    *   Spending decreases slightly to about $99,250 annually on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, or $8,271 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There's also a bigger focus on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+)**
    *   Spending drops further to $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> or $5,150 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there's less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending generally follows three phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Consider Alex, a Canadian retiree, as an example of these [[stages_of_retirement_and_changing_expenses | stages of retirement]]:

*   **Early Retirement (65-70 years old)**
    *   Alex spends about $70,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, or around $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Housing costs are high, even with the mortgage paid off, due to maintenance and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease significantly without daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Food spending is slightly less due to less dining out and more home-prepared meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Alex enjoys spending on hobbies and travel, utilizing his newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years old)**
    *   Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs reduce further as travel becomes even less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   Food costs remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Spending on travel reduces slightly, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Later Retirement (75+ years old)**
    *   Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, or around $4,160 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain stable, with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs are significantly lower as he rarely travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Healthcare becomes a major expense, including potential costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Travel spending ceases, and Alex focuses more on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Real-Life Client Insights on Retirement Spending

At Blueprint, observed [[reallife_examples_of_retirement_budgets | retirement spending patterns]] among clients vary widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   On [[average_monthly_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average]], retirees tend to spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   High-end households usually spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Some retirees comfortably manage on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

A common [[impact_of_age_on_retirement_spending_patterns | trend]] is that spending tends to start higher in the early years of retirement and gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This reduction is attributed to several factors:
*   Housing costs lowering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Transportation becoming less of a need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Overall [[mindset_shift_in_retirement_spending | lifestyle changes]] as retirees age, with spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Understanding these [[impact_of_age_on_retirement_spending_patterns | trends]] is crucial for [[calculating_and_planning_for_retirement_expenses | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

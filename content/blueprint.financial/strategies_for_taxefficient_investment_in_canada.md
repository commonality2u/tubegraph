Big tax updates in 2025 are set to reshape how business owners in Canada can plan and invest, aiming to minimize taxes, protect cash flow, and enable more investment into businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Capital Gains Tax for Business Owners

2025 marks Canada's first full year with a new capital gains tax structure for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. The inclusion rate for corporations has increased from 50% to 66.67% (or 2/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This change means a larger portion of a corporation's capital gains is now subject to taxation, impacting after-tax profits, investment decisions, and financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For instance, if ABC Corp sells an investment property for a capital gain of $200,000 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:
*   **Under old rules**: 50% ($100,000) included in taxable income. At a 10% corporate tax rate, tax owed would be $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Under 2025 rules**: 66.67% ($133,333) included in taxable income. At the same 10% rate, tax owed increases to $13,334 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This represents an extra tax liability of $3,334 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This increase significantly affects businesses that rely on capital gains, such as those investing in real estate or securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It's important to note that these changes *do not* affect sole proprietors and [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_canadians | self-employed individuals]], who will still be taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This is strictly for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Planning Strategies for New Inclusion Rates

Two key [[tax_saving_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | strategies]] are being recommended to address the new inclusion rates:

1.  **Reassessing Investment Portfolios**:
    *   Businesses investing in high-growth assets or stocks that generate large capital gains will pay more tax under the new rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   A simpler option might be to switch to Canadian stocks that pay dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Dividends often come with tax perks, such as the ability to recover some tax through the refundable dividend tax on hand (RDTOH) mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

2.  **Contribute to an Individual Pension Plan (IPP)**:
    *   IPPs offer a tax-efficient [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | retirement planning tool]] for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Contributions are tax-deductible from corporate income, which can help offset taxable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   This strategy not only reduces immediate tax liabilities but also builds a solid [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement fund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   IPPs are similar to having an RRSP for a corporation but come with even higher limits and flexibility for succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## CPP 2025 Enhancement and Contribution Updates

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) enhancements bring significant changes for business owners, including increased contribution thresholds that will impact payroll costs and cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. These updates maintain two levels of contributions: regular CPP up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) and CPP2 up to the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*   For 2025, the YMPE has increased to $71,500 (up from $69,700 in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   The YAMPE has risen to $81,300 (up from $73,200 in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Updated Contributions in 2025

*   **Regular CPP**: Contributions are calculated at a rate of 5.95% on income up to $71,500 for employees, which is matched by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **CPP2**: Contributions apply to income between $71,500 and $81,300 at a rate of 4% for employees, also matched by employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Self-employed individuals**: Pay both the employee and employer portions. For example, a [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_canadians | self-employed]] person earning over $81,300 in 2025 will contribute a total of $8,888 to their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

These changes are aimed at improving [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement security]], gradually increasing the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% over 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. However, the higher contribution rates mean extra costs for employers and [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_canadians | self-employed individuals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Businesses, especially those with multiple employees, may need to adjust their budgets to account for higher payroll expenses or explore smarter [[advanced_tax_strategies_for_small_businesses_in_canada | tax-efficient]] ways to compensate employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

For some good news, the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) limit has increased to $1.25 million in 2025, up from approximately $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This allows individuals to shield a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For example, selling a qualified small business for $1.25 million in 2025 could potentially exempt the entire capital gains from individual tax, depending on the remaining LCGE limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

**Pro Tip**: The LCGE is available to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their portion of the gains, significantly reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI)

The Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI) provides tax relief for business owners by reducing the capital gains inclusion rate to 1/3 (or 33.33%) on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This incentive is being phased in gradually, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching the full $2 million cap by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

For example, a small business owner with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would only include $33,333 in taxable income under the CEI, compared to $66,667 without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

While the CEI reduces the inclusion rate, it does not address investment income taxation, which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. For many business owners, the previously mentioned LCGE remains a more effective tool because it offers a complete exemption for eligible capital gains, especially when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Strategically allocating gains across shareholders can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Combining [[advanced_tax_strategies_for_small_businesses_in_canada | strategies]] like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Electronic Filing Requirements

Starting in 2025, new CRA rules require businesses filing six or more information returns (such as T4s or T5s) to file electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Additionally, corporations with over $1 million in revenue must submit T2 returns online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. While this may not impact more established businesses already filing electronically, smaller businesses or those using manual methods will need to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Businesses should sign up for a "My Business Account" if they don't already have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Bonus Change: Credit Card Transaction Fee Reductions

While not tax-related, starting October 19, 2024, eligible small business owners will see credit card transaction fees drop by up to 27% under new agreements with Visa and MasterCard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This initiative is expected to save eligible businesses around $1 billion over five years by significantly reducing operational costs tied to credit card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

More than 90% of credit card-accepting businesses will qualify for reduced fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>:
*   In-store transaction rates will drop to an annual average of 0.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   Online transactions will see up to a 7% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

To qualify, businesses must meet annual sales thresholds: under $300,000 for Visa and under $175,000 for MasterCard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

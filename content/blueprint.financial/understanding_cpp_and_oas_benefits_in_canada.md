Many Canadians mistakenly believe that the [[Canada Pension Plan CPP and its international considerations | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, retirees who rely heavily on these benefits often find it challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down how much you can expect to receive from CPP and OAS, what life on these benefits looks like, and the importance of financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The [[Canada Pension Plan CPP and its international considerations | Canada Pension Plan]] is determined by your lifetime earnings and the amount you contributed during your working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While higher contributions lead to higher payouts, most individuals do not receive the maximum amount due to the requirement for decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### CPP Payouts (2025 Estimates)
*   **Starting at Age 60**:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 65**:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 70**:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $2,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

Delaying your [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | CPP]] significantly increases your monthly payment, with waiting until age 70 boosting benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, this strategy requires the financial ability to defer income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. CPP is generally designed to replace only 25% to 33% of your working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Pension

The OAS pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not tied to employment income or work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and whether you choose to defer payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### OAS Maximum Monthly Payments (March 2025)
*   **Age 65 to 74**: $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **Age 75 and Older**: $800 (a 10% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

For seniors with very low total income, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) may be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Maximum GIS (2024)**: $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Income Impact**: GIS is reduced dollar for dollar by any additional income, meaning even small RRSP withdrawals can affect eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Notably, OAS does not count towards GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Total Estimated Income from Government Benefits

If you have no other income sources, your combined monthly retirement income might resemble this example:
*   CPP: ~$800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   OAS: ~$700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   GIS: ~$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total Monthly Income**: ~$2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

Relying solely on CPP, OAS, and GIS, even with GIS, results in an income barely above the poverty line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This is generally not considered a comfortable retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Cost of Living Breakdown: Can You Live on $1,500-$2,000 per Month?

While technically possible, living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada requires serious sacrifices and a barebones lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Major Expenses and Challenges
*   **Housing**:
    *   **Homeowners (outright)**: Still need to budget for property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, potentially $500+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Renters**: Minimum of $1,000 per month in smaller cities, which can consume over half of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Rents in major cities like Toronto or Vancouver easily exceed $2,000 for a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: A basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month, with eating out being a luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs**: Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be major expenses, especially if not covered by a provincial plan for those under 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: Costs for electricity, heating, internet, and phone, plus car insurance, gas, and maintenance ($200-$500/month) if you own a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Public transit can be at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Limitations**: No budget for travel or significant purchases like furniture, appliances, or a new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund**: Living month-to-month means unexpected bills can derail finances, potentially requiring reliance on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## When Relying on CPP and OAS Alone Could Work

While challenging, living primarily on CPP and OAS might be feasible in specific scenarios:
*   **Owning Your Home Outright**: Eliminates mortgage or rent payments, drastically lowering expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners can also consider options like borrowing against their home or downsizing to free up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Living in a Very Low-Cost Area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can significantly stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Having Extra Support**: Help from family, additional investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant financial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree in a small town in Ontario with minimal expenses could potentially manage on $2,000 per month with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## When Relying on CPP and OAS Alone Falls Apart

For most retirees, living on only CPP and OAS is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:
*   **Major City Costs**: High cost of living in major cities makes it very difficult to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **No Savings**: Without emergency funds, every month becomes a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

The reality is that most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement constantly worrying about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Strategies to Bridge the Gap and Increase Retirement Income

If CPP and OAS won't cover your expenses, several strategies can help:
*   **Delay CPP and OAS**: Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP grows by 42% by delaying to age 70, and OAS increases by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This is a key aspect of [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | timing CPP and OAS benefits for tax savings]].
*   **Part-time Work or Delaying Retirement**: Working longer or taking on part-time work can provide necessary income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**: Downsizing or relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or even abroad can make your money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Utilize Government Benefits**: Programs like the Allowance for the Survivor can provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning**: Strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal can lower your tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Creative Retirement Strategies with Limited Income
Some retirees are adopting innovative approaches to make their limited income work:
*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming housesitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Turning Hobbies into Income**: Monetizing skills through teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Programs that allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend of slow travel through low-cost countries, utilizing extended tourist visas to live affordably for months at a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This lifestyle is often embraced by active and healthy retirees in their 60s or early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## The Importance of Retirement Planning

If you're relying solely on CPP and OAS, a backup plan is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The sooner you plan, the more options you have to address potential shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Retirement planning is akin to a medical checkup: early diagnosis of a problem allows for more solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. If you are still working, now is the time to create a strategy to avoid depending entirely on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Developing a customized retirement strategy, whether it involves [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | maximizing your government benefits]], lowering taxes, or building an investment portfolio, is key to a worry-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

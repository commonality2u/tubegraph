Deciding when to start your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is one of the most impactful retirement choices, yet many Canadians may not be optimizing their benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Over 95% of Canadians begin receiving CPP at or before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. However, waiting until age 70 often proves optimal, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | decision on when to start CPP]] is a complex puzzle, with factors like life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams needing to fit together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## CPP Basics and Claiming Ages

While over 70% of Canadians claim CPP at age 60 or 65, many other options exist, including ages 61 to 64 and 66 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

*   **Starting Early (Age 60)**: Choosing to start CPP at 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those living beyond approximately 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70**: Waiting until 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For instance, a $1,000 monthly benefit at 65 would become $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Actuarial Insights on Life Expectancy and CPP Timing

A detailed 2020 Actuarial study on CPP take-up decisions provides key insights, particularly concerning [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>:

*   **Starting CPP at 60**: Best for those needing immediate income or with health concerns leading to shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This ensures early access to funds but comes with permanently reduced lifetime payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It can also help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on benefits like GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Starting CPP at 65**: This default option provides steady payments and is ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Payments equalize with the 70 option around age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **[[delaying_cpp_benefits | Delaying CPP to 70]]**: Provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, increasing payments by the maximum and adjusting for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for those with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It acts as longevity protection, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For most, [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

The [[impact_of_increased_life_expectancy_on_retirement | importance of life expectancy]] is stressed by these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Estimating Your Life Expectancy

Your life expectancy is a crucial piece of the CPP puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Insights from Actuarial and Statistics Canada Data

*   **Gender Differences**: Women tend to live longer than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The 2020 CPP take-up decision report suggests 82% of women are likely to live past 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Healthy Lifestyles and Family History**: A healthy lifestyle or family history of longevity increases odds of living longer (79% for men, 85% for women to live past 80), making [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delayed CPP]] a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **General Trend**: Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Stats Canada Data**: More recent data from Stats Canada shows that life expectancy increases the older you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This suggests life expectancy is often longer than people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Implications for CPP**:
    *   Women benefit more from [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] due to longer lifespans, reaching late 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Men with shorter life expectancies should carefully consider their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   [[delaying_cpp_benefits | Delaying CPP]] acts as longevity insurance, particularly for women who may face financial strain in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Online Life Expectancy Calculators

Several online calculators can provide estimates based on age, gender, lifestyle, family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits and provides actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, this tool asks detailed questions about health and habits, offering personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   While results can differ, these tools offer a more tailored outlook than general statistics, guiding CPP decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Deeper Methods to Refine Estimates

For a more precise estimate of your life expectancy, consider:
*   **Genetic Testing**: Can uncover health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations**: Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing**: Advanced tests that measure aging at a cellular level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings**: Regular checkups are crucial for monitoring chronic conditions that impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Using a CPP Present Value Calculator

While break-even tables are a good starting point, they often fall short by not considering the investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A CPP present value calculator incorporates these [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | additional factors]] to provide a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

This type of calculator (e.g., on Tax Tips) allows you to input:
*   Estimated monthly benefit at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Estimated annual indexation (inflation rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   Desired start ages (60, 65, 70, or others) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Your estimated life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   An estimated rate of return for your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

Using a hypothetical example with a woman living to 86 and a 2% rate of return, the calculator shows that starting CPP at 70 yields the highest present value ($320,000) compared to age 60 ($222,000) or 65 ($286,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

However, adjusting the rate of return significantly impacts the results:
*   At 4% return, the gap between starting ages narrows, though age 70 might still be optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   At 6% return, the choice between 65 and 70 becomes more balanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

The assumed life expectancy is a major variable:
*   If you live to 100, age 70 is by far the best choice, providing over $130,000 more in present value than starting at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The cumulative payments can be vastly different (e.g., $1 million vs. $550,000 at age 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
*   If you pass away early (e.g., at 72), starting at age 60 would have been the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

Inflation rates also greatly affect the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Strategic Planning for CPP

Deciding when to start CPP is like a complex puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. A comprehensive approach involves:
*   **Scenario Planning**: Running different scenarios based on your life expectancy and break-even points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies**: Analyzing how CPP income interacts with your overall tax situation to potentially reduce or increase your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining if [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] can help avoid or reduce Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating CPP with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

For many, [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_age_60 | delaying CPP]] into their late 60s or 70s proves beneficial, especially when considering life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

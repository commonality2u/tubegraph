Real estate plays a significant role in determining net worth in Canada, with its impact varying across different wealth classes. While it can be a substantial driver of wealth accumulation, especially after 2019 due to appreciation, it also presents challenges like high mortgage debt and disadvantages for renters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## Real Estate and the Lower Class (Bottom 20%)

For the lowest 20% of Canadians by net worth, home ownership is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Real estate assets average just under $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, leaving very little to no home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. This group often carries significant debt, including over $44,000 in mortgage debt on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Real Estate and the Lower Middle Class (20-40% Quintile)

Home ownership begins to become more common for the [[net_worth_growth_in_canada_after_reaching_100000 | lower middle class]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Real estate assets for this group average $169,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. However, mortgage balances remain high at around $98,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, meaning much of their net worth is tied up in home equity rather than liquid investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Real Estate and the Middle Class (40-60% Quintile)

The [[economic_resilience_and_income_inequality_in_canada | middle class]] often owns homes, with an average real estate portfolio of $391,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. They typically carry about $145,000 in mortgage balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. While home equity is a major component of their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, it also makes them vulnerable to market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The biggest gains for this group, particularly after 2019, were driven by real estate appreciation and investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. To ensure continued financial security, the middle class needs to reduce reliance on real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>.

## Real Estate and the Upper Middle Class (60-80% Quintile)

This group holds significant assets in real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. The average real estate assets of the upper middle class are $636,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>, indicating that most own high-value properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. Mortgage balances average about $154,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, showcasing significant home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Beyond primary home ownership, this group often owns rental properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

## Real Estate and the Upper Class (Top 20%)

The top 20% of Canadians in terms of net worth likely own multiple properties, including primary residences, vacation homes, and rental properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. They possess over $1.3 million in real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Their average mortgage balance is about $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>, reflecting very strong overall home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. Their assets span real estate, businesses, and investments, contributing to diversified wealth and reduced financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

## General Observations

Real estate significantly contributes to the growing wealth of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Consequently, renters are at a significant disadvantage when it comes to wealth accumulation through property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

Even after departing Canada, certain Canadian-sourced incomes may remain taxable for individuals who are no longer considered Canadian tax residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Understanding these tax obligations is crucial to avoid unexpected liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Types of Taxable Canadian Income for Nonresidents

Non-residents may be subject to tax on the following types of Canadian-sourced income:

*   **Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) Pensions**
    Generally, these pensions are subject to a 25% withholding tax for non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | tax treaties]] between Canada and other countries can reduce this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Rental Income from Canadian Property**
    Non-residents earning rental income from Canadian properties are typically subject to a 25% withholding tax on the gross rental amount, rather than the net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) Withdrawals**
    RSP withdrawals by non-residents are generally subject to a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce Withholding Tax

There are several strategies non-residents can employ to potentially reduce their Canadian withholding tax liabilities:

*   **File Form NR5 (Application for a Reduction in the Amount of Non-Resident Tax to be Withheld)**
    Non-residents can apply for a lower withholding tax rate on certain income by filing Form NR5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. If approved, taxes are withheld at a reduced rate based on the expected Canadian tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This reduction is valid for five years, but a Canadian tax return must be filed annually to maintain the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Elect Under Section 216 for Rental Income**
    For rental income, non-residents can elect under Section 216 to pay tax on net rental income (gross rental income minus expenses) instead of the standard 25% withholding tax on the gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This often results in a lower tax liability and allows for deductions of property-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. To qualify, a Section 216 tax return must be filed annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Leverage Tax Treaty Considerations**
    Withholding tax rates vary by country under Canada's [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | tax treaties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Before filing Form NR5 or electing under Section 216, it is advisable to check if the new country of residence has a [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | tax treaty]] with Canada that automatically lowers the withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. For instance, moving to the U.S. will likely result in lower CPP, OAS, and RSP withholding tax rates than the standard 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Managing rental properties and other income sources in Canada as a non-resident can be complex due to ongoing paperwork, tax obligations, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Without proper planning, individuals could face unexpected tax liabilities or even double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Tax law involving two tax systems can be exponentially harder to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

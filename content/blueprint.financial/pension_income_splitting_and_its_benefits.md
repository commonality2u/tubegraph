[[income_splitting_for_tax_savings | Pension income splitting]] is a strategy designed to reduce taxable income and help avoid the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This strategy is particularly effective for couples where one spouse earns significantly less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## How Pension Income Splitting Works
This strategy allows you to transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This helps the higher-income spouse keep their taxable income under the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Benefits of Income Splitting
*   **Reduced Taxable Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>: By transferring income, the higher-earning spouse's taxable income is reduced, potentially moving them into a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Lower Overall Tax Burden** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>: While the lower-income spouse is taxed on the transferred amount, the couple generally pays less tax as a whole due to the overall lower tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Protection Against OAS Clawback** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>: Reducing the higher-income spouse's taxable income helps keep it below the OAS clawback threshold ($90,997 for 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, preserving full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Example Scenario
Consider Peter Parker, who earns $60,000 annually from his pension, and his wife, Mary Jane, who earns a much lower amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
By using [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_families_and_retirees | pension income splitting]], Peter can transfer $30,000 (50%) of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Peter is then in a lower tax bracket, reducing the risk of triggering the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Mary Jane, who is in a lower tax bracket, is taxed on the $30,000 she receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   As a couple, they pay less tax overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

By reducing Peter's taxable income, this strategy helps to keep his total income below the OAS clawback threshold, preserving his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This makes [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | pension income splitting]] a valuable strategy for [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement planning]], especially for couples with a significant income disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

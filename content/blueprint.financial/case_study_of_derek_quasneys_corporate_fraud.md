Derek Quasney, formerly the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Lake Louise ski resort, built a reputation in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Operating from the Calgary headquarters, he held a position of trust, overseeing the company's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, between 2015 and 2017, Quasney engaged in fraudulent activities that would ultimately cost him his career, freedom, and over $700,000 in fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Methods of Fraud

Quasney employed three distinct methods to divert company funds for personal gain:
*   **Company Checks to Personal Accounts** He signed company checks, but instead of directing them to vendors or for business expenses, he made them payable to his own credit card and bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This scheme alone allowed him to pocket $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Double-Dipping on Vehicle Allowance** Already receiving a $700 per month vehicle allowance through payroll, Quasney claimed it again in his expense reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This netted him an additional $113,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Double Salary Deposits** In an even bolder move, Quasney arranged for his salary to be deposited twice: once into one bank account and again into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This trick earned him an additional $73,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

In total, Quasney misappropriated over $350,000 from his employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His biggest mistake was not reporting any of this income to the [[cras_investigation_and_penalties_in_tony_auros_construction_fraud_case | Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Consequences of Getting Caught

When the case went to court, Quasney faced severe penalties:
*   **Fraud Conviction:** In the Canmore Court, he received a fraud conviction resulting in 4.5 years in prison and a $669,000 fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **[[tax_fraud_and_consequences_in_canada | Tax Evasion]] Conviction:** In a Calgary Court, he was convicted of [[tax_fraud_and_consequences_in_canada | tax evasion]], which came with a one-year jail penalty and a $106,000 fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

In total, Quasney was sentenced to 5.5 years behind bars and $775,000 in fines, a sum far exceeding what he gained from his scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Additionally, his CPA designation was suspended, his professional reputation was ruined, and he will carry a criminal record for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## [[lessons_on_avoiding_tax_fraud_and_following_legal_tax_practices | Lessons from the Quasney Case]]

Quasney's story serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering [[tax_fraud_and_consequences_in_canada | cheating the system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:

> [!CAUTION] All Income is Taxable, Even Stolen Money
> The [[cras_investigation_and_penalties_in_tony_auros_construction_fraud_case | CRA]] expects all income to be reported, whether from a salary, investment, or fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Unreported stolen money will appear as missing in the [[cras_investigation_and_penalties_in_tony_auros_construction_fraud_case | CRA]] system, potentially flagging it as a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Corporate Fraud Rarely Goes Unnoticed
> Large financial discrepancies can trigger red flags, and audits can uncover the truth, even years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

> [!WARNING] [[impact_of_tax_evasion_on_personal_and_professional_life | Tax Evasion Carries Heavy Consequences]]
> A few years of "easy money" can lead to massive fines, loss of careers, and prison time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Quasney likely thought he could get away with it, but he didn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. His story is a reminder that when it comes to fraud, "the house will always win," and in this case, the house was the [[cras_investigation_and_penalties_in_tony_auros_construction_fraud_case | CRA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

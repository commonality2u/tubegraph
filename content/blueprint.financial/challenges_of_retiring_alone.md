Retiring alone presents unique [[challenges_of_retirement_income_in_canada | financial challenges]] compared to retiring as a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64, representing 37.8% (almost four out of every ten), are heading into retirement single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[Financial planning for single retirees | Planning to retire solo]] requires a different approach to avoid common money mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Financial Realities for Single Retirees

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older was:
*   **Couples**: $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Single Seniors**: $30,820 per year (approximately $2,568 per month), which is significantly less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Without a partner to split costs, share benefits, or offer a safety net, every dollar becomes more critical for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Singles often face higher taxes, fewer government support programs, and greater pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. However, with [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | smart planning]], it is still possible to retire comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Biggest Financial Risks for Single Retirees

Here are six major financial risks for single retirees and how to mitigate them:

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity & Investment Risk)
The fear of running out of money is the number one concern in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. For singles, this risk is heightened because:
*   There's no partner's pension or extra savings to rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   Singles need more savings than couples to cover the same lifestyle, as they bear all expenses alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. For example, a single person pays the same Netflix subscription fee as a couple, but the couple shares the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: Follow a benchmark like the 4% rule, but single retirees may need to adjust it lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.
*   **Diversify Investments**: A mix of growth (stocks) and safety (bonds, GICs) helps ensure funds last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   **Careful Retirement Financial Planning**: Work with a financial planner to build a customized strategy based on lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Every decision, such as when to take CPP, matters more when on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden
Being single in retirement often means paying significantly more in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Singles lack access to income splitting or spousal benefits, frequently placing them in higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. A single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income, simply because the couple could split income and both qualify for full OAS and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Smart Withdrawal Decisions**: How and when you withdraw money from your RRSP, TFSA, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact how much you keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning**: This is crucial when on your own, as every withdrawal decision can make a big difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs
Inflation is a "silent wealth killer" that erodes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. When single, there's no one to share the burden of rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. [[Economic challenges and their effect on retirement savings | Planning for inflation]] is not optional; it is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space**: Unlocking home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Co-living or House Hacking**: Sharing living spaces with friends to cut fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **[[Retiring abroad to stretch retirement savings | Moving to Lower-Cost Provinces or Countries]]**: This is a growing trend to stretch every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits / No Financial Safety Net
A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the lack of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.# Challenges of Retiring Alone in Canada

[[Financial planning for single retirees | Planning to retire solo]] requires a different approach to avoid common money mistakes, as it fundamentally changes how one needs to plan for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

*   **Careful Retirement Financial Planning**: Work with a financial planner to build a customized strategy based on lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Every decision, such as when to take CVP, matters more when on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden
Being single in retirement often means paying significantly more in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Singles lack access to income splitting or spousal benefits, frequently placing them in higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

Inflation is a "silent wealth killer" that erodes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. When single, there's no one to share the burden of rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. [[Economic challenges and their effect on retirement savings | Planning for inflation]] is not optional; it is absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space**: Unlocking home equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Co-living or House Hacking**: Sharing living spaces with friends to cut fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits / No Financial Safety Net
A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the lack of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. If not part of a couple, there's no automatic rollover for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions when you pass away, potentially leading to a massive tax hit to your estate and less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer little to no support for single retirees, reducing guaranteed income options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Plan RRSP and RIF Withdrawals Carefully**: Gradual withdrawals can help reduce the final tax burden on your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   **Review Beneficiaries Regularly**: Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance designations are up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support
Loneliness in retirement is not just an emotional concern; it's a financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Studies show that single retirees are more prone to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Join Community Groups**: Volunteering, social clubs, and classes help keep you engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   **Consider Co-living**: Senior co-housing or shared housing cuts costs and builds friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Use Tech for Safety**: Features like fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts can protect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: Scammers disproportionately target older adults who live alone, so staying informed and secure about your finances is even more important for singles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### 6. Health and Long-Term Care Costs
Unlike couples, single retirees do not have a built-in caregiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Healthcare costs can add up quickly, and singles face higher long-term care expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. Typical costs in Canada include:
*   **Home Care**: $25 to $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Assisted Living**: $3,000 to $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   **Government-Subsidized Nursing Home**: $2,000 to $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Private Care**: $5,000+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

#### Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Budget for Care**: Keep a reserve fund or look into long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Assign a Power of Attorney**: Ensure someone you trust can make medical and financial decisions if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Consider Disability and Critical Illness Insurance**: These policies can help cover major medical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire – A Single Retiree's Plan

Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single retiree, worried about having enough saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. His initial situation:
*   **Estimated Spending**: $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Assets**: $200,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **Return Estimate**: 5% in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
*   **Income**: No pension, no spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   **Health**: Good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Plan**: Take CPP and OAS at age 65, aiming for money to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

### Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Inflation
Andy's initial plan of $50,000 per year didn't account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. With a 2.1% inflation rate, his $50,000 would become:
*   Approximately $55,000 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.
*   Approximately $61,000 at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
This meant his purchasing power would drop, and his money would run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

### Improvement 1: Adjusting Spending Estimates
Most people overestimate their retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Spending typically drops by about 20% upon retirement and declines further with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Andy's revised spending estimates were:
*   $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   $35,000 per year in his 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
This change extended Andy's savings to age 85, significantly improving his outlook from 54% to 94% goal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

### Improvement 2: Delaying CPP and OAS
Andy initially planned to take CPP and OAS at age 65, receiving about $10,000 from CPP and $8,700 from OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. By delaying both to age 70, his benefits increased significantly:
*   CPP: $17,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   OAS: $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
This change pushed his projected shortfall from age 84 to age 88, nearly fully funding his retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. [[Challenges and strategies for living on CPP and OAS alone | Delaying CPP and OAS]] can be a crucial strategy for single retirees.

### Improvement 3: RRSP Meltdown for Tax Smoothing
Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was withdrawing mainly from his TFSA (tax-free) rather than his RRSP (taxable income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. To smooth out taxes and utilize lower tax brackets, Andy was advised to draw $30,000 per year from his RRSP from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. This strategy helped cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. This brought his plan to 102% funded, with a smooth, low effective tax rate (2-3%) until age 76, and no shortfall projected even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>.

### Building a Buffer: Creative Solutions
While 102% funded is good, a larger buffer is ideal. Three realistic options for Andy to build more margin:
1.  **Work One Extra Year**: By working one more year, earning his current $80,000 salary, Andy could increase his funding to 114%, providing a nice buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.
2.  **Woodworking Hobby Income**: Andy's woodworking hobby, which he's passionate about and has earned money from, could conservatively bring in $10,000 a year for six years. This would also put him at 112% of his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb Condo in Summer**: Since Andy often lives with family during summer, he could rent out his condo, estimated to bring in $10,000 a year for six years, also resulting in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

Andy preferred options two or three as he didn't want to work another year, highlighting the importance of starting retirement sustainably as early as possible, given that health can decline with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

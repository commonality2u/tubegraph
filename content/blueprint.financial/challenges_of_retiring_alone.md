From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Nearly one million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone, representing 37.8% of this age group, or almost four out of every ten individuals who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Retiring solo requires a different approach to financial planning to avoid significant money mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_retiree_financial_situations | Income Disparity for Retirees]]

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older was:
*   **Couples:** $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Single Seniors:** $30,820 per year (approximately $2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

This means single seniors earn significantly less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | Key Financial Risks for Single Retirees]]

Retiring alone presents [[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | unique financial challenges]] because there is no partner to share costs, benefits, or provide a safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Single individuals often face higher taxes, reduced government support, and greater pressure to manage all aspects of their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity and Investment Risk)

The number one fear in retirement is running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Similar to how a couple shares the cost of a Netflix subscription for two profiles, couples in retirement share expenses, split bills, and benefit from tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Single retirees must cover all expenses alone, making the risk of running out of money much greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They cannot rely on a partner's pension or extra savings and typically require more personal savings to maintain the same lifestyle as a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

**Strategies to mitigate this risk:**
*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate:** Adhere to a sustainable withdrawal rate, such as the 4% rule, potentially adjusting lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Diversified Investments:** Diversify investments with a mix of growth (stocks) and safety (bonds, GICs) to ensure longevity of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Careful Retirement Financial Planning:** Work with a financial planner to create a customized strategy based on lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Every decision, from when to take CPP to withdrawal amounts, significantly impacts single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden

Single retirees in Canada often face a higher tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Without access to income splitting or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently fall into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For instance, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income, simply because the couple could split income and both qualify for full OAS and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

**Strategies to reduce tax burden:**
*   **Strategic Withdrawals:** How and when money is withdrawn from RRSPs, TFSAs, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the amount of income retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning:** Tax planning is critical for single retirees, as every withdrawal decision can make a substantial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs

Inflation quietly erodes purchasing power, and for single retirees, there is no one to share the increasing costs of groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Planning for inflation is essential to ensure money goes further over a retirement that could last 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

**Creative ways retirees are combating inflation:**
*   **Downsizing/Renting Out Space:** Unlocking home equity by downsizing or renting out part of their home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Co-living/House Hacking:** Exploring co-living arrangements with friends or house hacking to reduce fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocation:** Moving to lower-cost provinces or even other countries to stretch retirement dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If considering retiring abroad, understanding the [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | tax implications]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits

A significant [[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | financial disadvantage]] of retiring single is the absence of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there are no automatic rollovers for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death, which can lead to a substantial tax hit on the estate and less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited support for single retirees, resulting in fewer guaranteed income options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

**Strategies to protect assets:**
*   **Careful RRSP/RIF Withdrawals:** Plan gradual withdrawals from RRSPs and RIFs to potentially reduce the final tax burden on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review:** Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance beneficiaries are up to date to ensure assets are distributed as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support

Loneliness is not only emotionally challenging but also a [[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | financial risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies indicate that single retirees are more susceptible to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Scammers frequently target older adults living alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

**Strategies to stay connected and protected:**
*   **Community Engagement:** Join community groups, volunteer, or participate in social clubs and classes to stay engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Co-living:** Consider co-living with other retirees in senior co-housing or shared housing to reduce costs and foster friendships <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This also helps with [[family_structure_and_support_in_retirement | social support in retirement]].
*   **Technology for Safety:** Utilize technology such as Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts for personal safety and financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 6. Health and Long-Term Care Costs

Without a spouse, single retirees lack a built-in caregiver, making health care costs and long-term care expenses a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These costs can accumulate rapidly:
*   **Home Care:** $25 to $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
*   **Assisted Living:** $3,000 to $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   **Government-Subsidized Nursing Home:** $2,000 to $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
*   **Private Care Nursing Home:** $5,000+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

**Strategies to plan for health costs:**
*   **Budget and Reserve Fund:** Budget for care and maintain a reserve fund, or explore long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Power of Attorney:** Assign a trusted individual as power of attorney to make medical and financial decisions if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Insurance:** Consider disability and critical illness insurance to help cover major medical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | Planning for a Solo Retirement: A Case Study]]

Effective financial planning is crucial for single retirees to navigate these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Initial Situation: Andy Dwire
Andy, a 65-year-old single retiree, plans to retire this year, aiming for $50,000 in annual spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. His assets include $200,000 in an RRSP and $100,000 in a TFSA, with an estimated 5% return in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. He has no pension or spouse, is in good health, and initially planned to take CPP and OAS at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. His goal was to make his money last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Correcting Inflation Misconceptions
Andy's initial plan did not account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. With a 2.1% inflation rate, his $50,000 annual spending would become $55,000 by age 70 and $61,000 by age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This meant his purchasing power would drop annually, and his money would run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Adjusting Spending Estimates
Most people overestimate their retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Spending typically drops by about 20% upon retirement and further declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. By adjusting Andy's spending estimate to $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s, $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s, and $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, his savings were extended to age 85, significantly improving his [[factors_contributing_to_falling_retiree_incomes | financial outlook]] from a 54% to a 94% goal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Optimizing Government Benefits and Tax Strategies
Delaying CPP and OAS until age 70 significantly increased Andy's annual benefits to $17,000 from CPP and $13,000 from OAS (compared to $10,000 and $8,700 respectively at age 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This change extended his funds to age 88, bringing his plan to be fully funded, showing the [[sustainability_of_retiring_on_cpp_and_oas | sustainability of retiring on CPP and OAS]] can be optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

However, his tax rate between ages 65 and 70 remained very low due to heavy TFSA withdrawals and minimal RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. To smooth out taxes, an "RRSP meltdown" strategy was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Andy would withdraw $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 to cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This brought his plan to 102% funded and kept his effective tax rate low and smooth (2-3% until age 76), eliminating any shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Building a Buffer and Increasing Confidence
While 102% funded is good, building a larger buffer provides more comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Three additional options were considered to reach retirement faster and more securely:
1.  **Work one extra year:** Earning $80,000 for one more year increased his funding to 114% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
2.  **Turn a hobby into income:** Earning $10,000 per year for six years from a woodworking hobby resulted in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb condo:** Renting out his condo for $10,000 per year for six years also resulted in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Andy preferred the hobby or Airbnb options as he did not wish to work another year, emphasizing that every year in retirement is crucial for health and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

This comprehensive planning process helps refine the plan and stress-test it against various scenarios like market drops, higher inflation, or long-term care costs, providing a clear roadmap and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. While the case study is a condensed version, detailed financial planning includes tax projections, market risks, healthcare costs, and estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Retirement as a single person in Canada can be challenging, but with proper planning, it is possible to maximize every dollar, minimize tax impacts, and achieve a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

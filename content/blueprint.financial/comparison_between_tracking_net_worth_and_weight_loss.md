Tracking goals significantly increases the likelihood of achieving them, with one study from Michigan State University suggesting it makes individuals 33% more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle applies broadly, from personal finances to health.

## [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | Tracking Net Worth]] Compared to Weight Loss

The act of [[tracking_and_analyzing_your_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] is analogous to tracking weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In both cases, small, consistent actions are key drivers of significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Research published by Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets experienced significant positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   Those who tracked approximately 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight over six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Participants who tracked 70% of the time lost 10% of their weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

The main takeaway from this research is that tracking is correlated with success towards goals, even if the tracking isn't perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Applying Tracking Principles to Finances

The same principle observed in weight loss applies directly to personal finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By [[tracking_and_analyzing_your_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] on a monthly or quarterly basis, individuals can:
*   Spot financial trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Make smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Stay on course towards their financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

Just like with weight loss, consistency is more important than perfection in financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics such as total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Tracking your net worth is akin to steering a ship with a compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Without a compass, one cannot know if they are drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

As Peter Drucker, considered the father of modern business management, stated, "What gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

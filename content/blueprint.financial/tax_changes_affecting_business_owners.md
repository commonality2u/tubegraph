Canada's 2025 tax landscape includes significant [[capital_gains_tax_updates_for_canadian_business_owners_in_2025 | tax changes for business owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Understanding these updates can help in [[tips_to_legally_reduce_tax_liabilities | maximizing tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and crafting effective [[advanced_tax_strategies_for_small_businesses_in_canada | tax strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Capital Gains Tax Adjustments for Corporations

The tax structure for corporate capital gains has been revised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Previously, 50% of a corporation's capital gains were included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Under the new rules, this inclusion rate has increased to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

> [!example]
> If ABC Corp realizes a capital gain of $200,000, two-thirds of that amount, approximately $133,000, is now added to the corporation's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

It is important to note that for corporations, this new capital gains inclusion rate applies from the first dollar, unlike for individuals where the higher rate begins after $250,000 in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This difference necessitates more careful [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_amidst_tax_changes | planning for business owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) allows individuals to exclude a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. As of 2025, the LCGE limit has significantly increased to $1.25 million, up from $1.01 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

> [!example]
> Selling a qualified small business for $1.2 million could result in all capital gains being exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

> [!info] Pro Tip
> The LCGE applies to each individual. Therefore, if multiple shareholders dispose of shares, each can potentially claim the exemption on their respective gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)

The Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI) is designed to support entrepreneurs by reducing the [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains inclusion rate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a> to one-third on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This incentive is being phased in, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, aiming to reach $2 million by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

> [!example]
> A small business owner selling their enterprise with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would include only one-third of that in their taxable income under the CEI, compared to two-thirds without the incentive, potentially leading to tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

Staying informed about these [[capital_gains_tax_changes | tax changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> and revisiting your [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_amidst_tax_changes | financial strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> is crucial for minimizing tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a> and growing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

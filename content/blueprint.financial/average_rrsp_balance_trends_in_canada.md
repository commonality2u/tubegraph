The average Canadian's [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] balance experienced a significant drop of over $30,000 in just one year, from 2022 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, this decline is not as concerning as it initially appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Historical Trends in Average RRSP Holdings

Average [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] account holdings show a 28% decline in average account values from 2022 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The national average dropped to $113,000 in 2023, down from approximately $144,000 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This reduction brings [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] balances closer to historical averages, suggesting that elevated levels in 2021 and 2022 were temporary spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These spikes were primarily caused by pandemic-related savings habits, where people cut expenses and increased their retirement contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The 2023 decline reflects a return to more normal savings levels following the pandemic-induced boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## RRSP Holdings by Age Group

Median data provides a more realistic snapshot of Canadians' savings than averages, which can be skewed by high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The latest available median data for [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSPs]], RRIFs, and LIRAs is from 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Key Observations:
*   **Median vs. Average Discrepancy:** For individuals aged 65 and older, the median balance is $224,000, significantly higher than the average of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This highlights how high-income earners skew average numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Younger Canadians (Under 35):** The median savings for this group is just $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Many young adults have very little saved, making early and consistent saving crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Mid-Life Savings Growth (35-54):** Savings improve in this age range, but the median of $30,000 to $70,000 is often insufficient for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Mortgages, family expenses, and careers make prioritizing retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Nearing Retirement (55-64):** The median savings grows to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While some individuals have over $216,000 on average, many will still need additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Retirees (65+):** The median savings remain at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Many retirees heavily rely on government benefits like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Economic family types influence savings data, with combined households generally having higher savings due to shared financial responsibilities and additional incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## [[regional_variations_in_rrsp_savings_in_canada | Regional Variations in RRSP Savings]]

A 2023 survey provides insights into how different regions across Canada manage their [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:
*   **Ontario:** Leads with the highest average [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] balance at $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Canada:** Boasted the highest average contribution at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

Despite variations, Canadians across the country remain engaged with their [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSPs]], either by building larger account balances or making consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## How Household Sizes Impact [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP Contributions]]

Larger households generally contribute more to their [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSPs]], likely due to higher combined incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:
*   **Two-person Households:** Lead with 4.2 million households contributing and a median contribution of $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Single-person Households:** Contribute significantly less, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

This pattern indicates that dual-income households are often better positioned to prioritize and grow their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP Contributions]] at Different Stages of Life

Contributions vary by age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>:
*   **55 and Above:** Contribute a median of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **15-24 Age Group:** Contribute a median of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This data shows a clear focus on long-term financial security as Canadians approach retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Economic Challenges Impacting RRSP Savings

Economic challenges, such as inflation and rising interest rates, significantly impact Canadians' ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

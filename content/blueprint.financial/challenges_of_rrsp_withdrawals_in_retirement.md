Many Canadian retirees express regret over inadequate planning for their [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | RRSP]] withdrawals, which can lead to increased taxes, reduced government benefits, and mandatory withdrawals that don't align with their financial requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">00:07:01</a>.

## The "Boomerang" Effect of RRSP Refunds

While receiving an [[Economic challenges affecting RRSP contributions | RRSP]] refund initially feels beneficial, many do not realize that this "boomerang" effect will later result in taxes on withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">00:07:21</a>.

## Unexpected Tax on Withdrawals

Unlike a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), every [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | RRSP]] withdrawal is considered fully taxable income, significantly impacting retirement earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">00:07:32</a>.

For instance, an individual earning $40,000 from CPP and a pension who withdraws $50,000 from their [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | RRSP]] for a home renovation would see their taxable income rise to $90,000, resulting in a substantially higher tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">00:07:38</a>. This tax burden could be mitigated by withdrawing smaller amounts over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">00:07:49</a>. This highlights the [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | importance of RRSP withdrawal strategies]] to manage tax implications.

## Forced Withdrawals at Age 71

By the age of 71, [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | RRSP]]s must be converted into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), necessitating mandatory annual withdrawals, regardless of the retiree's income needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">00:07:54</a>. For example, an individual with $500,000 in their [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | RRSP]] at age 71 must withdraw approximately 5%, or $26,400, under current rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">00:08:12</a>. This increases their taxable income to $76,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">00:08:23</a>. As they age, higher withdrawal rates are enforced, exacerbating the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">00:08:27</a>.

## Losing OAS Benefits to RRSP Withdrawals

Old Age Security (OAS) benefits begin to be clawed back when income reaches approximately $91,000, based on 2024 thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">00:08:33</a>. Substantial [[Registered Retirement Savings Plan RRSP contributions and withdrawals for nonresidents | RRSP]] withdrawals can push retirees past this limit, leading to a reduction or complete elimination of OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">00:08:41</a>. Many retirees regret not distributing their withdrawals earlier to prevent the loss of thousands in government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">00:08:45</a>.

## Prevention and Strategy

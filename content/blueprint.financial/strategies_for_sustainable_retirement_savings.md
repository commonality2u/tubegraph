Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone, representing 37.8% of this age group [00:00:00]. This includes individuals who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated [00:00:10]. Planning for retirement as a single individual requires a different approach compared to couples [00:00:15].

## The Financial Reality for Single Retirees in Canada

The average retirement income in Canada is lower for single seniors than for couples [00:00:35]. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older is $74,200 per year for couples (approximately $6,200 per month) [00:00:41]. For single seniors, this figure drops significantly to $30,820 per year (about $2,568 per month), which is less than 50% of what couples earn [00:00:53].

Retiring alone presents unique financial challenges, as there is no partner to share costs, benefits, or provide a safety net [00:01:08]. Singles often face higher taxes, less government support, and increased pressure to manage their finances independently [00:01:18].

## Key Financial Risks for Single Retirees and Mitigation Strategies

### Running Out of Money: Longevity and Investment Risk

The fear of running out of money is the number one concern in retirement [00:01:31]. Unlike couples who share expenses and benefit from tax savings, single retirees must cover all costs alone [00:01:49]. This risk is amplified for singles because they cannot rely on a partner's pension or extra savings, and they typically need more savings to maintain the same lifestyle [00:02:01].

*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: Follow a sustainable withdrawal rate, such as the 4% rule, but single retirees may need to adjust this lower based on market conditions [00:02:08].
*   **Diversify Investments**: Diversify investments with a mix of growth assets (stocks) and safety assets (bonds and GICs) to ensure funds last longer [00:02:20].
*   **Careful [[Retirement planning strategies for Canadians | Retirement Financial Planning]]**: Work with a financial planner to create a customized strategy considering lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance [00:02:30]. Decisions regarding when to take CPP and how much to withdraw are critical [00:02:40].

### Higher Tax Burden

Single retirees in Canada frequently land in higher tax brackets due to a lack of access to income splitting or spousal benefits [00:02:54]. An example shows a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income, primarily because the couple could split income and both qualify for full OAS and the age credit [00:03:10].

*   **Strategic Withdrawals**: How and when money is withdrawn from RRSP, TFSA, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the net amount kept [00:03:38]. Smart timing and drawdown strategies can save thousands in taxes over retirement [00:03:48].

### Inflation and Rising Costs

Inflation is a "silent wealth killer" that erodes purchasing power [00:04:05]. For singles, there's no one to share the burden of increasing costs for groceries, housing, or healthcare [00:04:11]. Planning for inflation is essential [00:04:17].

*   **Inflation-Adjusted Strategies**: Develop [[Strategies for extending retirement income | strategies that help money go further]] over a retirement that could last 30 or more years [00:04:21].
*   **Creative Cost-Saving Measures**:
    *   Downsizing or renting out space to unlock home equity [00:04:38].
    *   Exploring co-living with friends or house-hacking to reduce fixed costs [000:04:42].
    *   Moving to lower-cost provinces or countries to stretch dollars [00:04:47].

### No Survivor Benefits: Lack of a Financial Safety Net

A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the absence of survivor benefits [00:05:03]. Without a spouse, there are no automatic rollovers for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death, which can lead to a substantial tax hit on the estate [00:05:15]. Some employer pensions also offer limited support for single retirees [00:05:27].

*   **Careful RRSP and RIF Withdrawals**: Plan RRSP and RIF withdrawals carefully [00:05:37]. Gradual withdrawals can help reduce the final tax burden on the estate [00:05:42].
*   **Regular Beneficiary Reviews**: Regularly review and update beneficiaries for RRSPs, TFSAs, and insurance policies to ensure assets are distributed as intended [00:05:48].

### Less Social and Emotional Support

Loneliness can be a financial risk, as studies indicate single retirees are more prone to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams [00:05:56].

*   **Community Engagement**: Join community groups, volunteer, participate in social clubs, and take classes to stay engaged [00:06:11].
*   **Co-Living**: Consider co-living with other retirees, such as senior co-housing or shared housing, to cut costs and build friendships [00:06:17].
*   **Tech for Safety**: Utilize technology like Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts to enhance safety and security [00:06:26]. Scammers often target older adults living alone [00:06:37].

### Health and Long-Term Care Costs

Single retirees lack a built-in caregiver, making healthcare and long-term care costs a significant concern [00:06:46]. Typical costs in Canada for care can be substantial: home care ($25-$50/hour), assisted living ($3,000-$5,000/month), government-subsidized nursing homes ($2,000-$3,000/month), and private nursing homes ($5,000+/month) [00:06:58].

*   **Budget for Care**: Budget for potential care costs by maintaining a reserve fund or investigating long-term care insurance [00:07:18].
*   **Assign Power of Attorney**: Assign a trusted individual as a Power of Attorney to make medical and financial decisions if necessary [00:07:23].
*   **Consider Insurance**: Consider disability and critical illness insurance to help cover major medical expenses [00:07:31].

## Case Study: Andy Dwire's Retirement Plan

Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single retiree, initially aimed to retire this year, worried about having sufficient savings [00:07:55]. His initial plan involved $50,000 per year in spending, $200,000 in an RRSP, $100,000 in a TFSA, an estimated 5% return, no pension or spouse, good health, and taking CPP and OAS at age 65 [00:08:08]. His goal was to make his money last until age 90 [00:08:35].

### Initial Mistakes and Adjustments

1.  **Not Accounting for Inflation**: Andy's initial $50,000 annual spending projection did not account for inflation [00:08:44]. With a 2.1% inflation rate, $50,000 today becomes approximately $55,000 at age 70 and $61,000 by age 75 [00:08:54]. This oversight caused his money to run out around age 74 [00:09:10].
2.  **Overestimating Spending**: Most people overestimate their retirement spending [00:09:27]. In reality, spending often drops by about 20% upon retirement and further declines with age [00:09:37]. Adjusting Andy's spending to $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s, $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s, and $30,000 or less after age 85, extended his savings until age 85 [00:09:44]. This adjustment improved his goal progress from 54% to 94% [00:10:32].

### Strategic Optimizations for [[Retirement Strategies Integrating CPP | Sustainable Retirement Income]]

1.  **Delaying CPP and OAS**: Andy initially planned to take CPP and OAS at 65, receiving about $10,000 from CPP and $8,700 from OAS [00:10:45]. Delaying these benefits until age 70 significantly increased his income to $17,000 from CPP and $13,000 from OAS [00:10:57]. This change alone pushed his shortfall to age 88 from age 84, effectively making his plan "fully funded" [00:11:07].
2.  **RRSP Meltdown (Tax Smoothing)**: Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was withdrawing heavily from his tax-free TFSA and minimally from his RRSP (which counts as income) [00:11:18]. To smooth out taxes, an "RRSP meltdown" was implemented, where Andy would withdraw $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 [00:11:36]. This strategy covered expenses while delaying CPP and OAS, bringing his plan to 102% funded and maintaining a low, smooth effective tax rate (2-3% until age 76) [00:11:51]. This eliminated any shortfall even past age 90 [00:12:14].

### Building a Buffer for Added Confidence

Even at 102% funded, a buffer is recommended [00:12:20]. Andy considered three additional options to achieve a more comfortable margin:

1.  **Working One Extra Year**: By working one additional year and earning his current salary of $80,000, Andy could increase his funding to 114% [00:12:38].
2.  **Earning Income from a Hobby**: Leveraging his woodworking hobby, Andy could conservatively earn $10,000 per year for six years, boosting his goal progress to 112% [00:12:58].
3.  **Airbnbing His Condo**: Renting out his condo during summer months when he stays with family could also generate about $10,000 a year for six years, similarly resulting in 112% funding [00:13:22].

Andy preferred options two or three as he did not want to work an additional year [00:13:37]. Starting retirement as quickly as possible in a sustainable manner is encouraged, especially as health may decline with age [00:13:47].

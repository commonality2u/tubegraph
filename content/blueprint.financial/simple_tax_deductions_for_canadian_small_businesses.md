Navigating tax season can feel like money is being left on the table for many business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide covers some of the simplest yet most effective tax write-offs for small businesses in Canada, designed to be easy to understand and quick to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. By understanding these deductions, business owners can maximize their savings and retain more of their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## 1. Meals and Entertainment

Businesses can deduct 50% of the cost of meals and entertainment expenses if they are business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This includes expenses for client meetings, business lunches, and staff events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For instance, a $200 client dinner would allow for a $100 deduction on a tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The 50% limit is due to the assumption that a portion of these expenses provides personal benefit, not solely business benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## 2. Office Expenses

Almost every business incurs office expenses, making them one of the easiest deductions to claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This category includes:
*   Rent for office space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Utilities such as water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   Office supplies like pens, paper, and printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

## 3. [[work_from_home_deduction_in_canada | Home Office Expenses]]

Often [[tax_deductions_and_credits_commonly_missed_by_canadians | missed by small business owners]], especially with the rise of home offices, these expenses are highly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. If a portion of your home is used regularly and exclusively for business, you can deduct a percentage of home expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These deductible costs include mortgage interest, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To calculate the claim, measure the square footage of your dedicated workspace and divide it by the total square footage of your dwelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This percentage is then applied to your total home costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, if a 200 sq ft office in a 2,000 sq ft home means 10% of the home is used for business, 10% of total annual home expenses (e.g., $2,000 out of $20,000) can be claimed as a business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While the CRA has no strict maximum, deducting up to 20-25% of your home expenses is generally considered acceptable without scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## 4. Vehicle Expenses

If a vehicle is used for business purposes, such as client visits or supply pick-ups, a portion of the costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Deductible expenses include:
*   Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Lease payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Parking and toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   Depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

To calculate, determine the business-use percentage of total driving kilometers for the year and apply that to your total vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For example, if $10,000 was spent on a vehicle, and 5,000 out of 20,000 total kilometers driven were for business, 25% ($2,500) is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Specific rules apply to certain vehicle types; for instance, depreciation claims for luxury cars are capped (e.g., $36,000 plus sales tax at a 30% CCA rate as of the latest update) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## 5. Travel Expenses

Business-related travel costs are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This includes transportation, accommodation, meals (subject to the 50% rule), and incidentals like tips and internet fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, airfare, hotel stays, meals, and taxi fares for a trip to meet a client in another city are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The key is that these expenses must directly relate to business activities and not be for personal trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## 6. Bank and Financial Fees

Various fees associated with managing business finances are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This includes bank charges, credit card processing fees, and other financial transaction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Examples include monthly business bank account fees, credit card payment processing charges, or wire transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## 7. Professional Fees

Legal, accounting, and consulting fees incurred for business operations are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This covers costs for legal advice, tax preparation, and general business consulting services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Hiring a lawyer to draft contracts or an accountant to prepare tax returns falls into this category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## 8. Software and Online Tools

In the digital age, subscriptions to software, cloud services, and other online tools essential for business operations are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Examples include project management software or cloud storage service fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## 9. Product Cost (Cost of Goods Sold)

The cost of goods sold, raw materials, and inventory purchased for resale are fully deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. These expenses are directly tied to generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For a retail business, the cost of acquiring inventory for resale is deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## 10. Advertising and Marketing Costs

Most advertising expenses are deductible, as promoting a business is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This includes traditional ads (print, TV) and digital marketing efforts (Google ads, social media promotions, email campaigns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Ensure the advertising is directly related to your business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## 11. Employee Salaries and Benefits

If you have employees, their salaries, wages, and benefits are fully deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This covers base pay, bonuses, commissions, and certain perks like health insurance and retirement contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Tracking Expenses

Accurate expense tracking is crucial for maximizing deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Technology, such as apps designed to track mileage and categorize business expenses automatically, can simplify this process and save effort during tax season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Examples of helpful software include QuickBooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Many Canadians regret contributing to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) due to unforeseen inflexibility and significant tax consequences upon withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Unlike a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) where withdrawals are tax-free and contribution room is restored, RRSP withdrawals come with steep tax implications and permanently reduce contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Inflexibility and Immediate Tax Consequences

A major regret among RRSP holders is the mistaken belief that their savings can be accessed like a regular bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   Every dollar withdrawn from an RRSP is taxed as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This often pushes individuals into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   For example, Lisa, earning $65,000 annually, withdrew $20,000 from her RRSP for emergency home repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Her taxable income jumped to $85,000, significantly increasing her tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   Unlike a TFSA, money withdrawn from an RRSP cannot be re-contributed, leading to a permanent reduction in retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> "Think of your TFSA as like an open safe; you can take money in and out of it freely. Whereas an RRSP on the other hand is more like a vault with a time lock. Once you put your money in, getting it out comes with a costly price." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

### [[withholding_tax_surprises_for_rrsp_withdrawals | Withholding Tax Surprises]]

Another significant regret is underestimating the automatic [[withholding_tax_surprises_for_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] on RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Many assume they will only owe tax at filing time, not realizing a portion is deducted upfront, leaving them with less cash than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The withholding rates depend on the amount withdrawn:

| Withdrawal Amount | Withholding Rate (Federal) |
| :---------------- | :------------------------- |
| Up to $5,000      | 10%                        |
| $5,001 to $15,000 | 20%                        |
| Over $15,000      | 30%                        |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

*   **Example: Jeff's Emergency Expense** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
    *   Jeff withdrew $10,000 to cover an emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   His bank withheld 20% ($2,000), so he received $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   However, because his marginal tax rate was higher than 20%, he had to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes at filing time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Example: Maria's Vacation Withdrawal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
    *   Maria, a retiree, withdrew $25,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
    *   Her bank automatically withheld 30% ($7,500), leaving her with $17,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   At tax time, her income rate was even higher than 30%, forcing her to pay another $2,500 beyond what was already deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Many individuals regret assuming that the [[withholding_tax_surprises_for_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] was the final amount owing, only to receive an unpleasant surprise at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This makes early [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RRSP withdrawals]] far less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Before contributing to an RRSP, it's crucial to ask: "Do I need this money before retirement?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> If the answer is "yes" or even "maybe," a TFSA or another account might be a better choice for accessible savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. However, for long-term retirement savings and strategic tax benefits, an RRSP can be a powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Challenges with RRSP Withdrawals in Retirement

Many retirees regret not planning their [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_to_minimize_taxes | RRSP withdrawals]] properly, leading to higher taxes, lost government benefits, and forced withdrawals that don't align with their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

> "Think of your RRSP refund as kind of like a boomerang. Getting an RRSP refund feels great at the time when you're investing; it's kind of like throwing a boomerang and then getting cash back. But what most people don't realize is that that boomerang swings back later and hits you with taxes on withdrawals." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

### Unexpected Tax Burden

Unlike TFSAs, every RRSP withdrawal is fully taxable income, which can significantly impact retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

*   **Example: David's Home Renovation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>
    *   David earns $40,000 from CPP and a pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
    *   He withdrew $50,000 from his RRSP for home renovations, increasing his taxable income to $90,000 and triggering a much larger tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   He could have reduced his tax burden by withdrawing smaller amounts over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Forced Withdrawals at Age 71

By age 71, an RRSP must be converted into a [[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_tax_efficiency | Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)]], requiring mandatory withdrawals each year, regardless of whether the retiree needs the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

> "It's kind of like Cinderella when the clock strikes midnight, except instead of turning into a pumpkin, it turns into mandatory withdrawals and tax bills." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

*   **Example: Michael's RRIF** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
    *   Michael has $500,000 in his RRSP when he turns 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   Under current rules, he must withdraw close to 5%, which is $26,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This increases his taxable income to $76,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   As he ages, higher withdrawal rates force him to take out even more, compounding the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Loss of Old Age Security (OAS) Benefits

Large RRSP withdrawals can push retirees over the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback threshold, reducing or eliminating OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. According to 2024 thresholds, OAS starts getting clawed back at around $91,000 of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Many regret not spreading out [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_to_minimize_taxes | withdrawals]] earlier to avoid losing thousands in free government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

While RRSPs can be a powerful tool, they are only effective when used wisely and with proper planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

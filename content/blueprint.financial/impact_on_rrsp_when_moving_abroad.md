When you permanently [[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | leave Canada]], your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is subject to specific rules regarding contributions, withdrawals, and tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Contributions and Withdrawals

As a non-resident of Canada, you can still contribute to your RRSP if you have available contribution room from Canadian-earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, without Canadian income, you will not generate new contribution room as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Any withdrawals you make from your RRSP as a non-resident are typically subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This rate may be lower if a tax treaty exists between Canada and your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

If you decide to return to Canada, you can resume contributing to your RRSP based on any new Canadian income you generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Tax Implications

Your RRSP investments will continue to grow tax-deferred in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, your new country of residence might tax the income or gains within your RRSP, depending on its specific tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This varies by country, and some tax treaties may offer tax relief or exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

For instance, the US does not tax the incoming gains within your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, but other countries might depending on their tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Canada has tax treaties with 91 different countries, including common destinations like the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Tax Treaties and Withholding Tax
[[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | Tax treaties]] play a crucial role in determining the [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax implications of RRSP withdrawals]] for non-residents. For example, due to the tax treaty between Canada and the US, the withholding tax rates on RRSP withdrawals for non-residents can be reduced to 15% for periodic withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. It is essential to check the specific tax treaty details for your intended country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Managing Your RRSP Abroad

You can keep your RRSP open and manage your investments even as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees if you plan to withdraw funds, as these can impact your overall return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

As a non-resident, you can also convert your RRSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_to_rrif_conversion | Withdrawals from your RRIF]] will generally have similar withholding tax rules, typically 25%, unless a tax treaty reduces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Minimum withdrawals from your RRIF are based on your age and the fund's value, similar to if you were living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

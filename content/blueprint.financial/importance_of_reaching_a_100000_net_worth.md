Reaching a net worth of $100,000 is a crucial financial milestone for Canadians, often serving as a catalyst for significant wealth acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canadian households typically achieve this initial $100,000 net worth between the ages of 28 to 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Once this benchmark is crossed, net worth grows rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For instance, between ages 35 and 44, the average net worth jumps to almost $660,000, which is over six times the initial $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This momentum continues into the 40s and early 50s, with the average net worth for Canadians aged 45 to 54 rising to $1.34 million, more than 13 times the initial amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The late Charlie Munger emphasized the importance of this milestone, stating, "I don't care what you have to do, just get to $100,000. After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Why Net Worth Accelerates After $100,000

There are three key reasons behind this rapid growth:

### 1. Investing and Compounding Returns

Once the $100,000 mark is achieved, building wealth becomes significantly easier due to the power of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Compounding Illustration
> Imagine investing $10,000 per year with a 10% annual return in tax-free accounts like a TFSA or RSP, aiming for $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
>
> *   **0 to $100,000:** This initial milestone takes the longest, requiring a little over 7.27 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Progress at this stage is primarily driven by disciplined contributions rather than growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
> *   **Second $100,000:** Only takes 4.25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
> *   **Third $100,000:** Takes about 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
> *   **Fourth $100,000:** Takes 2.34 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
> *   **Reaching $500,000:** Takes less than 2 years to add the next $100,000, signaling that invested money is doing much of the heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
> *   **Subsequent Milestones:**
>     *   To $600,000: 1.62 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>
>     *   To $700,000: 1.4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>
>     *   To $800,000: 1.24 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>
>     *   To $900,000: 1.11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
>     *   To $1 million: Just one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
>
> The total time to reach $1 million using this strategy is approximately 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

As net worth grows, the balance between savings contributions and growth from returns shifts dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. For the first $100,000, approximately 73% comes from contributions, with only 27% from investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, by the $1 million mark, this flips, with 75% of wealth produced by returns and only 25% from direct contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. A major tipping point occurs around $300,000, where returns begin to outpace contributions, causing compounding to accelerate wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At $1 million, investments do triple the work of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Rocket Analogy
> Compounding can be thought of as the launch phase of a rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Most effort is needed to break free from financial gravity to reach the first $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Once this "financial gravity" is escaped, the journey becomes faster and easier, like a rocket moving smoothly through space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

A spreadsheet tool is available online to experiment with these numbers, allowing users to input their own interest rates and payment amounts to see how quickly they can reach $100,000 or $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### 2. Income Growth

Income plays a significant [[role_of_income_growth_in_increasing_net_worth | role in building wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. In Canada, a striking wealth gap exists between income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. In 2024, the lowest 20% income bracket has an average net worth of approximately $375,000, while the top 20% have an average net worth of almost $2.3 million—over 510% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Even modest increases in income bracket show a significant difference:
*   21-40% income group: Average net worth around $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   41-60% income bracket: Average net worth approximately $791,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   61-80% group: Average net worth breaks $1 million at nearly $1.1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>

Higher earners not only have more income but also accumulate wealth at a much quicker pace, and this gap between income levels tends to grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. As individuals progress in their careers, their income is likely to increase, providing more opportunities to save and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

#### Strategies to Increase Income in Canada

Understanding these numbers can help guide smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Location Matters:** Relocating to provinces with higher wages can boost income and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Alberta, for example, offers the highest average income at $61,500 per year, which, combined with relatively lower living costs, can allow for greater savings and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Invest in Education:** Higher education significantly boosts earning potential in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A bachelor's degree yields a median income of approximately $69,000, while a college diploma brings in about $47,000, a high school diploma about $35,000, and no certificate about $26,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Investing in education, especially in in-demand fields, can substantially increase income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Choose High-Income Careers:** Specialized industries like management, engineering, finance, and healthcare offer higher wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. For example, Senior Management pays an average of about $91 per hour, engineering close to $50, and finance, health, and science roles earn about $42 to $44 hourly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Trades and transport also offer solid wages at about $32 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Start a Business:** Many of Canada's wealthiest individuals built their fortunes by starting businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Business ownership offers the potential for significant wealth through growth, profits, and eventual sale, making it a strong pathway to financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### 3. High Savings Rate

A high savings rate is a fundamental key to [[investing_strategies_for_increasing_net_worth | building wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Regardless of income, if all earnings are spent, net worth remains at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Saving allows investments to grow and is the percentage of income put aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. A higher savings rate means more can be invested, accelerating compounding and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

In Q2 2024, the average Canadian savings rate rose to 7.2%, up from 4.9% the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While this is progress, there is still room to save more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Setting a savings rate higher than the national average can provide a significant advantage for investment and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

A major barrier to saving is lifestyle inflation—spending more as income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. To counter this, extra income from promotions or bonuses should be directed towards savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Starting early is crucial, as the sooner savings begin, the more time compounding has to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Even small, regular savings can snowball over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Savings is a habit; setting aside a fixed percentage of income monthly builds discipline and maintains progress toward financial goals, particularly the first $100,000, which fuels long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

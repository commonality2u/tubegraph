## How to Maximize Contributions

*   **Prioritization:** High-income earners should consider prioritizing RRSP contributions for tax breaks, especially if their employer offers matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Automation:** Set up pre-authorized contributions for your RRSP to ensure consistent savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

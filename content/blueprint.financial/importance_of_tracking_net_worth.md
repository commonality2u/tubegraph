Tracking financial goals can significantly increase the likelihood of achieving them, with one study from Michigan State University suggesting a 33% greater chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For one financial planner, tracking their net worth since 2019 has "completely transformed" their financial management and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Why Track Net Worth?

Tracking net worth is comparable to tracking weight loss: small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania indicated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw notable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Those tracking 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The key takeaway is that tracking correlates with goal success, even if not perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The same principle applies to finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By tracking net worth monthly or quarterly, individuals can:
*   Spot trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Make smarter decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Stay on course towards financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

Consistency, not perfection, is the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Tracking net worth is akin to steering a ship with a compass; without it, one might drift off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## How to Track Net Worth Using a Spreadsheet

Tracking doesn't have to be difficult, especially with tools like a simple Google Sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The initial setup of such a sheet takes about 10 to 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, with monthly updates requiring only about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Spreadsheet Setup and Maintenance

The process involves:
1.  **Downloading and copying the Google Sheet**: It's recommended to name the copy with the year, e.g., "2025 net worth tracker," and start a new one at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
2.  **Setting the start month and net worth goal**: The start month should be the beginning of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The net worth goal can be customized, and resources on average net worth in Canada and the [[importance_of_reaching_a_100000_net_worth | importance of reaching a $100,000 net worth]] can help determine a suitable goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
3.  **Entering current assets**: This includes cash accounts (checking, savings, PayPal), GICs, and even cars (though they require depreciation tracking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
4.  **Entering long-term assets**: Examples include registered accounts (TFSA, RSP, FHSA) and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The spreadsheet works for both individuals and households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
5.  **Entering current liabilities**: This covers credit cards, revolving lines of credit, and car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
6.  **Entering long-term liabilities**: This typically includes student loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

A pro tip for maintaining consistency is to set a recurring monthly reminder on the first of each month to update the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This quick two-minute update helps stay committed to the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Analyzing the Data

Once data is entered, the spreadsheet's dashboard provides valuable insights:
*   **Current Net Worth, Assets, and Liabilities**: Displays total figures and the shortfall to reach the net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: Visually represents the progress of net worth throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Dips in the trend should prompt investigation into what caused them (e.g., market dips affecting risky assets, requiring re-evaluation of risk tolerance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Asset vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Shows the proportion of current versus long-term assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Detailed progress for each month, including percentage increases and decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

After each year, it's recommended to create a new copy of the spreadsheet, delete the old data, and fill it in for the new year (e.g., 2026, 2027) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This allows for [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | tracking and comparing net worth annually]] to see how performance measures up against previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Alternative Net Worth Tracking Tools

While a custom spreadsheet is a preferred method for its free nature, full control, and high customizability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, several other tools are available for tracking net worth in Canada, each with its own costs or limitations:

*   **Wealthica**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview of net worth. However, advanced features are often behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Quicken (replacing Mint)**: Mint, formerly a popular free option in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription. While it offers robust financial tracking, its cost might not be justified when free alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app that monitors spending and manages finances. It has a free version, but premium features incur a monthly or annual fee. It's an option for those comfortable paying for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Ultimately, the choice of tracking method depends on individual goals and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

As Peter Drucker, often considered the father of modern business management, stated, "What gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Tracking net worth is a simple step that can lead to significant financial wins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

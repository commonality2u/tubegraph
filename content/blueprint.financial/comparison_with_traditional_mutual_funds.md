All-in-one ETFs are presented as a low-cost alternative to traditional mutual funds in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Fee Structure
One of the most significant advantages of all-in-one ETFs is their low fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

- **Traditional Mutual Funds**: Typically charge an average Management Expense Ratio (MER) of about 2% in Canada, which significantly impacts investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. For instance, many mutual funds offered by RBC charge around 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

- **All-in-One ETFs**: Usually charge a much lower MER, ranging from 0.2% to 0.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This makes them considerably more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

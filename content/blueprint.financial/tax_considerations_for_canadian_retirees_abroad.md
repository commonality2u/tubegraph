Many Canadians dream of retiring abroad, envisioning a life of sunshine and relaxation. However, it's crucial to understand how moving overseas affects Canadian government retirement benefits such as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The financial rules change quickly, and the consequences of not understanding them can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): What You Lose First

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit intended to support low-income seniors who live in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Not Portable** The GIS is not portable and is strictly tied to your physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Cessation Rule** If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue filing Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **No Workaround** There is no social security agreement that protects your GIS; it will not follow you abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. If GIS is a critical part of your retirement income, it's important to consider this before [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_retiring_abroad_for_canadians | relocating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. You may need to delay your move, adjust your budget, or explore other income options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study: Gan
> Gan, a 71-year-old retiree, moved from Vancouver to Mexico and was surprised when her GIS was terminated a few months into her move because she was outside Canada for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

> [!tip] Residency Trick
> Some retirees maintain part-year residency in Canada (e.g., "snowbirds") to keep their health care and tax status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They ensure not to stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP): What You Keep

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is based on your contributions during your working life in Canada, not on your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Portability** Your CPP benefits will travel with you; the amount you receive is the same whether you're living in Canada or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Survivor and Child Benefits** If you are receiving CPP survivor benefits or child benefits, these also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Tax Considerations for CPP Abroad

*   **Withholding Tax** Your CPP payments may be subject to [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | withholding tax]] if you are considered a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   **Tax Treaties** If Canada has a [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | tax treaty]] with your new country of residence, that tax could be reduced or even eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Default Rate** Without a [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | tax treaty]], you could face a 25% [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | withholding tax]] on your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. For example, the tax treaty with the US may help you avoid [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | withholding tax]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Social Security Agreements** Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries, which help avoid double contributions, ensure uninterrupted CPP coverage, and coordinate benefits if you worked both in Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Local Tax Laws** While your CPP amount doesn't change, your new country might tax those payments differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It's smart to check local tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Receiving CPP Payments

You can have CPP payments direct deposited into a Canadian bank account, or in many countries, receive them in local currency through a local bank, or even mailed as a check in Canadian dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS): The Wild Card

Old Age Security (OAS) is based on residency, not on your work history or contributions like CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

*   **Qualification Rule** To qualify for OAS while living outside of Canada, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. If this threshold is met, your monthly OAS payment will continue, even if you are living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Cessation Rule** If you don't meet the 20-year rule, your OAS could stop if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and re-establish residency to receive it again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Exceptions** You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time you lived in both countries is at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Note that years lived in another country do not increase your OAS amount; they only help determine if you qualify to keep receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Tax Considerations for OAS Abroad

*   **Taxable Income** Your OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Federal tax isn't automatically withheld each month, but you can request voluntary tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident Withholding Tax** Your OAS may be subject to a [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | non-resident withholding tax]], with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   **Tax Treaties** If you live in a country with a [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | tax treaty]] with Canada, that rate may be reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For instance, the Canada-US tax treaty means your OAS is not subject to [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | withholding tax]] if you move to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, for a country like Germany, the [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | tax treaty]] may allow Canada to tax public pensions like OAS at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Tax Slips and Filing** While abroad, you'll receive an NR4 tax slip each year instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. You must include this when you file your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. You must also continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

> [!tip] OAS Recovery Tax (Clawback)
> The OAS recovery tax, or clawback, begins at an income threshold of $93,454 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. You can manage your taxable income through RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This is part of broader [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | retirement tax strategies]].

## Planning Strategies

Understanding these implications is key to successful retirement planning abroad.

> [!example] Case Study: Anita
> Anita, 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years in Canada. She qualified for CPP, OAS (having met the 20-year residency threshold), and GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Portugal has social security and tax treaties with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
>
> *   **CPP** Continues without interruption, with a reduced 15% [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | withholding tax]] due to the [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | tax treaty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
> *   **OAS** Also continues as she met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. (Had she moved a year earlier, she would have received nothing until returning to Canada or qualifying through a treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.)
> *   **GIS** Stops after 6 months, regardless of income level, as it requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
>
> **What Anita did right:**
> *   She delayed her move until she hit 20 years of residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
> *   She chose a [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | treaty]] country like Portugal to reduce tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
> *   She started planning early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Your Travel Companions: CPP, OAS, and GIS Abroad

Think of your benefits as travel companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>:

*   **CPP:** Your "ride or die" friend. It sticks with you wherever you go, though your destination might charge a fee (tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **OAS:** More selective. It will only come if you built a strong relationship (20+ years of living in Canada after age 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Otherwise, it might stay home unless you have "mutual friends" in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **GIS:** The friend who loves Canada. Generous while you're there, but will "ghost you" once you leave for more than 6 months. There's no [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | treaty]] or workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Additional Pro Tips

*   Consider drawing down your RRSPs before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This can be part of broader [[effects_of_relocating_on_canadian_retirement_savings_and_benefits | retirement savings and benefits considerations]].
*   Plan for private health care, as provincial coverage ends after 6 to 7 months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

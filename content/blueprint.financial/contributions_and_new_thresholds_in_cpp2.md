The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) has undergone significant changes since 2019, including the introduction of the CPP2 enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These changes are designed to enhance retirement benefits through updated thresholds and rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Two Levels of Contributions

The CPP now includes two distinct levels of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Regular CPP Contributions

Regular CPP contributions are calculated based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   In 2025, the YMPE is set at $71,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Employers are required to match employee contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   Self-employed individuals pay the combined employee and employer rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### CPP2 Contributions

CPP2 applies to earnings that fall between the YMPE and the Yearly Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   The YAMPE is capped at $81,200 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   No additional CPP contributions are required for earnings above the YAMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Contribution Examples (2025)

To illustrate how these contributions work, consider the following examples for the year 2025:

### Mark's Contributions

Mark earns $71,500 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Pensionable Earnings Calculation**: His pensionable earnings for regular CPP are calculated by taking the YMPE ($71,400) minus a $3,500 exemption, resulting in $67,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Regular CPP Contribution**: At a 5.95% contribution rate, Mark will contribute approximately $4,033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   This amount is matched by his employer, leading to a total contribution of over $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### James's Contributions

James earns $81,300 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. His contributions include both regular CPP and CPP2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **First Tier (Regular CPP)**: For earnings up to the YMPE, his contribution is the same as Mark's, approximately $4,030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Second Tier (CPP2)**: For earnings between the YMPE ($71,400) and YAMPE ($81,200), which is $9,900, he contributes an additional 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This equates to another $396 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Total Contribution**: James's total contribution is $4,420, which is matched by his employer, bringing the total to nearly $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Impact on Different Income Levels

At an income level of $81,300 (which is above the YAMPE), both regular CPP and CPP2 contributions reach their respective caps, totaling $4,440 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The CPP2 contribution thresholds specifically apply to earnings between $71,200 and $81,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For incomes exceeding $81,300, no further contributions are required beyond the YAMPE, and total contributions remain constant at $4,443 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Think of CPP2 contributions like an add-on to a streaming subscription: it's an added cost, but it provides extra benefits for your future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Goal of CPP Enhancements

The end goal of these [[cpp_enhancements_and_changes_since_2019 | CPP enhancements and changes since 2019]] is to replace more of an individual's income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The previous CPP rate replaced 25% of a worker's average lifetime earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. With the enhanced rate, the replacement rate is set to increase to 33.33% (or one-third) of average work earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This will be phased in over 40 years, beginning in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

For instance, someone earning $60,000, who previously received about $15,000 in CPP benefits per year, is expected to receive about $20,000 with the enhancements once fully rolled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

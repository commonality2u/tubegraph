From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone, representing a staggering 37.8% of this age group who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demographic shift significantly alters the approach required for [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | retirement tax strategies for Canadians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The average after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older as of 2022 highlights this disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:
*   For couples, the median after-tax income was $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   For single seniors, it was significantly lower at $30,820 per year (approximately $2,568 per month), which is less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

[[the_reality_of_retiree_income_in_canada | The reality of retiree income in Canada]] for singles comes with unique financial challenges, including facing higher taxes and fewer government support options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Higher Tax Burden for Single Retirees

Retiring alone in Canada often means incurring a higher tax burden, likened to an unofficial "single tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Without access to income splitting or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently find themselves in higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

For instance, a report by "Single Seniors for Tax Fairness" highlighted that a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is because couples can split their income and both qualify for full Old Age Security (OAS) and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This makes [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | tax planning]] even more critical when retiring alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## No Survivor Benefits

One significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the lack of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Without a partner, there is no automatic rollover for Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs), or pensions upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This can result in a substantial tax hit to the estate, leaving less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Additionally, some employer pensions offer limited to no support for single retirees, reducing guaranteed income options for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Strategies to Protect Against Tax Risks

Smart planning can significantly reduce the tax bill for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Strategic Withdrawals
The timing and method of withdrawing funds from RRSPs, Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and OAS can greatly affect the amount of income retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Gradual RRSP/RIF Withdrawals
To reduce the final tax burden on an estate, it is advisable not to wait too long to draw down RRSPs and RRIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Gradual withdrawals can help manage the tax impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Beneficiary Review
Regularly reviewing and updating beneficiaries for RRSPs, TFSAs, and insurance policies ensures assets are distributed as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Financial Planning Scenario: Andy Dwire

Consider Andy Dwire, a single 65-year-old planning to retire. He initially estimated needing $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, with assets of $200,000 in his RRSP and $100,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He has no pension or spouse and planned to take CPP and OAS immediately at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. His goal was for his money to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### The Impact of Inflation
A common mistake is not accounting for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. With a 2.1% inflation rate, Andy's $50,000 annual spending would become approximately $55,000 by age 70 and $61,000 by age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This causes his money to run out much earlier, around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Adjusting Spending Estimates
Retirement spending often declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. By adjusting Andy's spending to $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s, $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s, and $30,000 or less after age 85, his savings could extend until age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This alone increased his retirement goal progress from 54% to 94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Optimizing Government Benefits and Taxes
Delaying CPP and OAS can significantly increase annual income from these sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If Andy delays taking CPP and OAS until age 70, his annual income from these benefits would increase from $10,000 (CPP) and $8,700 (OAS) to $17,000 (CPP) and $13,000 (OAS) respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This strategy alone pushed his shortfall to age 88 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, effectively making his plan fully funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### The RRSP Meltdown Strategy
Initially, Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA (which does not count as income) rather than his RRSP (which does) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. To smooth out taxes and improve long-term financial stability, an "RRSP meltdown" strategy was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Andy drew $30,000 per year from his RRSP from age 65 to 69 to cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This strategy increased his plan's funding to 102% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a> and resulted in a low and smooth effective tax rate, mostly between 2-3% until age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, eliminating any shortfall past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Building a Greater Buffer
Even at 102% funded, it's beneficial to build a larger buffer. Andy had additional options:
*   **Working one extra year:** Earning $80,000 for one more year increased his funding to 114% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Earning from a hobby:** Andy's woodworking hobby could conservatively generate $10,000 a year for six years, bringing his funding to 112% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Renting out property:** Airbnb-ing his condo for the summer months could also bring in an estimated $10,000 a year for six years, also resulting in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

While working an extra year provides a significant buffer, options like monetizing hobbies or renting out property are often preferred by retirees as they allow for an earlier retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

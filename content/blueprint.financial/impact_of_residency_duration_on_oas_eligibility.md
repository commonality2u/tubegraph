For immigrants to Canada, the duration of their residency significantly impacts their eligibility for Old Age Security (OAS) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), which is based on work contributions, OAS is determined entirely by how long an individual has resided in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Key Residency Requirements for OAS

There are three critical periods of residency that dictate OAS entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>:

*   **10 Years:** This is the absolute minimum residency in Canada after the age of 18 to qualify for *any* OAS payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **40 Years:** To qualify for the *full* OAS payment, an individual must have resided in Canada for 40 years after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **20 Years (for retirement abroad):** If planning to retire outside Canada, an immigrant must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after the age of 18 to continue receiving OAS payments while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Failure to meet this 20-year minimum could result in losing OAS benefits entirely upon leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Impact of Partial Residency

If an immigrant arrives in Canada later in life, their OAS payment will be prorated based on their years of residency. For example, someone who immigrates at age 50 and retires at 65 (15 years of residency after 18) would receive only 15/40ths of the full OAS amount, which is approximately 37.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This partial qualification can significantly reduce retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## International Social Security Agreements

Canada has social security agreements with approximately 50 countries, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These agreements can help individuals qualify for OAS even if they haven't spent the full time in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

For instance, living 7 years in Canada and 13 years in the UK could allow qualification for OAS under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. These agreements allow Canada to count time spent in certain other countries towards the 10-year or 20-year residency minimums for OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, it's crucial to note that this time does *not* count towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS benefits, meaning partial OAS will likely still be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Residency

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a tax-free benefit for low-income seniors that can add up to $13,000 per year on top of OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. However, GIS is strictly tied to living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. If an individual leaves the country for more than six consecutive months, their GIS payments will be cut off, regardless of income or continued Canadian tax filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This rule particularly impacts immigrants who may plan to retire abroad in their home country or a more affordable location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. There are no international agreements or tax treaties that protect GIS in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Some retirees use a "snowbird strategy," staying in Canada for at least 183 days a year to maintain benefits like GIS and healthcare, while spending the rest of the time abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Planning for Immigrants

Given the potential for reduced government benefits, immigrants need to plan carefully for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

*   **Delaying Benefits:** If affordable, [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying CPP and OAS payments]] until age 70 can increase monthly benefits by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Personal Savings:** Focus on building personal savings through RRSPs, TFSAs, and other investment vehicles, as well as considering side income in retirement, to supplement potentially lower government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Check Agreements:** Verify if Canada has a social security agreement with the country where retirement is planned. If close to the 20-year OAS threshold and planning to retire in a country without an agreement, delaying the move for a few years might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **[[oas_residency_requirements_for_retirees | Understand Residency Rules]]:** Before [[visa_and_residency_options_for_expatriates | moving abroad]], it's crucial to [[understanding_residency_and_tax_laws_in_a_new_country | understand residency and tax laws in a new country]] and know that OAS may stop if leaving Canada for more than 6 months without meeting the 20-year requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Strategic Financial Planning:** Coordinate RRSP and TFSA withdrawals to manage taxable income and avoid OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Consider [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | planning for delayed OAS and CPP withdrawal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Utilize income splitting with a spouse to lower the overall tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Be mindful of foreign exchange risk and how [[investment_strategies_and_managing_withdrawals_to_maintain_oas_benefits_in_retirement | investment income will be taxed]] in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

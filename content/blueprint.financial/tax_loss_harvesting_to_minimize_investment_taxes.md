[[Tax loss harvesting to minimize investment taxes | Tax loss harvesting]] is a practical strategy that can help reduce your tax bill by using investment losses to offset investment gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This approach is somewhat similar to income splitting strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## How Tax Loss Harvesting Works
When you sell an investment at a loss, you can use that loss to decrease the taxes owed on gains from other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. If your losses exceed your gains, you have the option to carry those losses forward to future years, or even back to previous years, to potentially receive a tax refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Example
Consider a scenario where you've realized a $10,000 gain from selling a stock earlier in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. To reduce your tax liability, you could sell another stock that has dropped in value, for instance, by $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This $6,000 loss would then offset a portion of your $10,000 gain, meaning you would only be taxed on $4,000 instead of the original $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## The Superficial Loss Rule
It's crucial to be aware of the Superficial Loss Rule, which often catches investors off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. If you, or your spouse, repurchase the identical stock within 30 days of selling it at a loss, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will not allow you to claim that loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Instead, the loss is added to the cost base of your newly acquired shares, delaying your ability to benefit from the tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Bonus Tips for Avoiding Mistakes
Even well-thought-out [[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada | tax strategies]] can fail due to simple errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

*   **Not planning for withdrawals:** Withdrawals from registered accounts, like RRSPs, can lead to unexpected taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. It's important to have a plan to manage these withdrawals [[taxefficient_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | tax efficiently]], particularly in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

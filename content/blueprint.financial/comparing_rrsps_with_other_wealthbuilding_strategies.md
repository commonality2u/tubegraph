While [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSPs]] are valuable tools, they may not be sufficient for individuals looking to build substantial wealth in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Wealthy Canadians often employ additional strategies beyond RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These include private equity, individual pension plans (IPPs), and family trusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Private Equity

Private equity involves investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments can fund startups, finance turnarounds, or support business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Unlike traditional stocks, private equity carries higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity, but offers the potential for significantly greater returns for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Why Most Private Equity Cannot Be in an RRSP

RRSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments, generally not allowing direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RRSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Therefore, most private equity investments must be held outside an RRSP unless through a specialized structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### When Private Equity Can Be Held in an RRSP

Despite restrictions, certain self-directed RRSPs allow access to private equity under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts enable investors to hold CRA-approved private equity funds, benefiting from tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Examples include the North Leaf Capital Partners private equity fund and select private equity investments offered by Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Downsides of Private Equity

> [!CAUTION] Private equity investments come with significant costs, including management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Other downsides include:
*   **High Risk:** These investments are highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell, and there's a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. For instance, many Canadian investors faced losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Long Lockup Periods:** Investors must commit their funds for extended periods, often between 5 to 10 years, before seeing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

While not for the faint of heart, private equity can be a powerful wealth-building tool beyond an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] for patient and strategic investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Individual Pension Plans (IPPs)

An Individual Pension Plan (IPP) is a pension plan specifically tailored for business owners or incorporated professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Unlike an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] with a set contribution cap, an IPP allows for higher contributions, especially for those over 40, while enjoying the same tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. It functions as a corporate-sponsored pension plan designed to provide structured retirement income, making it a choice for high-income earners seeking strategic savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### How an IPP Replaces RRSPs

An IPP is structured as a more powerful, personalized pension plan built for long-term security, unlike an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] which is more like a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. If maximizing retirement savings is a priority for high earners, an IPP might be a better fit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Key differences include:
*   **Reduced RRSP Contribution:** Once an IPP is established, the ability to contribute to an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] is reduced or eliminated, as the IPP takes priority in pension contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Bigger Contributions:** IPPs permit significantly higher contributions than RRSPs, particularly as individuals age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This allows for greater tax deferral and faster growth of retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Reliable Retirement Income:** IPP withdrawals follow a structured, pension-like system, providing predictable income for retirement planning, similar to a defined benefit pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### When an IPP Outperforms an RRSP: Real-World Examples

*   **High-Income Business Owner:** A 50-year-old business owner earning $250,000 annually, who had maxed out his [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] contributions, opted for an IPP. This allowed him to contribute over $50,000 annually, significantly increasing tax deductions and boosting retirement savings beyond the 2024 RRSP cap of $31,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Late Start to Retirement Savings:** A 55-year-old professional with a corporation, realizing insufficient retirement savings, established an IPP. This enabled her to make past service contributions, covering previous working years, rapidly growing her retirement fund while also reducing her corporation's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Corporate Tax Efficiency:** A 40-something incorporated consultant transitioned from an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] to an IPP for greater tax efficiency. Since IPP contributions are considered a corporate expense, his company's taxable income was reduced, leading to lower corporate taxes while building a secure retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **IPP Success Story:** A doctor client, who previously maxed out his RRSPs, increased his tax deductions by over 50% after switching to an IPP and secured a steady pension for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Setting up an IPP can be complex but offers significant tax and retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Family Trusts

[[alternatives_to_rrsps_used_by_wealthy_canadians | Family Trusts]] and RRSPs serve different purposes but can complement each other in building and preserving wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] is a personal tax-sheltered retirement savings tool, a Family Trust offers greater flexibility in wealth management, tax reduction, and planning for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### What is a Family Trust?

A Family Trust can potentially distribute income among family members in lower tax brackets, minimizing overall tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Unlike an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]], which has strict contribution limits and taxable withdrawals upon retirement, a Family Trust has no contribution caps and provides more control over fund distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It can hold diverse assets, including private equity, businesses, real estate, and other investments, making it a powerful tool for long-term financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Since [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RRSP withdrawals]] are fully taxable, they may not be the most efficient for wealth transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, a Family Trust can allow assets to be passed down tax-efficiently and enable income splitting among family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This makes it an excellent strategy for business owners and high-income earners aiming to reduce taxes and build generational wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Key Benefits of a Family Trust Over an RRSP

*   **No Contribution Limits:** A Family Trust can hold and grow significant wealth without annual contribution caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Tax-Efficient Income Distribution:** When structured correctly, income can potentially be allocated to family members in lower tax brackets to reduce overall tax exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Wealth Transfer Advantages:** Unlike RRSPs, which trigger full taxation upon withdrawals, a Family Trust can allow for potentially smoother and more tax-efficient intergenerational wealth transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For example, structuring a million-dollar [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]] into a trust can legally minimize taxes compared to passing it down and paying 50% in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

> [!TIP] It is highly recommended to use a corporate trustee for a Family Trust to maintain professionalism and prevent family disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

A Family Trust is not exclusively for the ultra-wealthy; it can be a smart tool for many Canadians seeking to manage wealth more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. When combined with an [[key_principles_for_building_rrsp_wealth | RRSP]], it can enhance tax efficiency, protect assets, and provide financial security across generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Understanding how IPPs, private equity, and [[alternatives_to_rrsps_used_by_wealthy_canadians | family trusts]] function can lead to significant tax savings and smarter wealth protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The [[canada_child_benefit_breakdown | Canada Child Benefit (CCB)]] can provide significant support, potentially covering up to $125,500 per child, tax-free, over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For a lower-income family, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## What is the CCB?

The CCB is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Indexed to Inflation**: The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Completely Tax-Free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### How the CCB Can Be Used
There are no restrictions on how CCB money can be spent; families can use it as needed for expenses like food, housing, or education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Eligibility for the CCB

The [[canada_child_benefit_breakdown | Canada Child Benefit]] is primarily based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI)
For married or common-law relationships, the AFNI combines your and your spouse's income minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### [[impact_of_income_on_canada_child_benefit | Impact of Income on Canada Child Benefit]]
As your AFNI increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families will see reduced or no payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The reduction happens in two stages:

*   **Stage 1**: If your income is between $36,525 and $79,000, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Stage 2**: If your income is above $79,000 (after the first reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over the $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

#### Example: CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six
| Family Net Income (AFNI) | Annual Benefit | Monthly Benefit |
| :----------------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| $35,000 or less          | $7,777         | $649            |
| $50,000                  | ~$6,804        | ~$570           |
| $100,000                 | ~$2,776        | ~$231           |
| $130,000                 | ~$1,814        | ~$151           |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>

As income increases, the annual and monthly benefit decreases, eventually being phased out at very high income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. For exact numbers, especially with multiple children, the CRA's CCB calculator is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## How to Get Paid

Getting the CCB is a straightforward process once you meet the eligibility criteria.

### Automatic Calculation
The CRA automatically calculates your CCB payments once you file your taxes; no extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Tax Filing Requirement
It is crucial that you and your partner file your taxes every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Your child must also be registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the climate action incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Direct Deposit
To receive payments faster, set up direct deposit with the CRA to have the money sent directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Payment Dates
CCB payment dates are typically between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Updating Information
It's important to keep your information up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   If your family's income changes (e.g., due to job loss), you might qualify for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   Life events like marriage, the birth of a new baby, or divorce should be reported to the CRA immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   In shared custody arrangements, inform the CRA so they can adjust benefits, as payments are typically split 50/50 between parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact

The CCB is a key tool in reducing child poverty and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### [[effect_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | Reducing Child Poverty]]
Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. In 2021 alone, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Tackling Declining Birth Rates
The CCB also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

A common question regarding the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivorship pension is whether [[eligibility_criteria_for_cpp_survivorship_pension | remarriage]] affects one's eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The good news is that remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect your eligibility for the CPP survivorship pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. You will continue to receive the pension payments even after starting a new relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

The pension will only cease upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

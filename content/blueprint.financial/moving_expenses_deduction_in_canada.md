The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offers a [[moving_expenses_deduction | moving expenses deduction]] that many Canadians overlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It is a tax break that could put significant money back into your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Eligibility Criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
You may be able to deduct moving expenses if you moved at least 40 kilometers closer to a new job or school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Deductible Expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>
Eligible moving expenses can include:
*   Travel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Storage fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   Temporary accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

## Common Pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
One of the main reasons people miss out on this deduction is forgetting to track their receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This can lead to missing out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars in deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The CRA will not remind you to claim these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. If you made a work-related move in the past year, it is advisable to locate all relevant receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> You can only deduct [[moving_expenses_deduction | moving costs]] against income earned at your new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If you moved but have not yet started work or school, you will need to wait to claim the deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Understanding what retirees actually spend is a common concern for those engaged in [[financial_planning_for_retirement | planning for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article breaks down average spending for Canadian retirees, detailing expenditure categories and how spending changes through different [[stages_of_retirement_and_changing_expenses | stages of retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Average Household Expenditures for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, was $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which equates to approximately $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### [[breakdown_of_household_expenditures_in_retirement | Breakdown of Household Expenditures]]

The largest portion of expenditures for retirees in Canada goes to shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This includes the cost of their main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

*   **Shelter:** Retirees spend around $13,814 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, breaking down to $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, which is about 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Even if homes are owned, significant costs persist for maintenance, property taxes, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food:** This accounts for about $7,667 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, or $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> (12.4% of monthly spending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This category covers both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation:** While generally lower for retirees than younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, transportation still represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Despite free healthcare in Canada, retirees allocate a higher portion to healthcare due to increased medical needs with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions:** These take up 5.4% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, emphasizing the need for continued [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | financial security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Household Operations:** Expenses for maintaining the home contribute 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Costs Change Through Life Stages

Household spending patterns change significantly as individuals progress through different phases of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Data from Stat Canada illustrates this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Middle-aged Households (40-54 years):** Spending is at its highest peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, averaging $122,646 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, or $10,220.54 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This rise is driven by family needs such as larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there is a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years):** Spending begins to decrease slightly to about $99,250 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, or $8,270.83 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There's also a greater emphasis on paying off mortgages and preparing further for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years):** Spending drops further to $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, or $5,150 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs like housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there is less spending on luxuries, with more emphasis on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending generally follows three phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

*   **Early Retirement (65-70 years) - High Spending Phase:**
    *   Example: Alex spends about $70,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> ($5,833 monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   Housing costs are still high but reduced post-mortgage, though maintenance and property taxes remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease significantly without daily commutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs begin to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Food spending is slightly less due to less dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Spending on hobbies and travel increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years) - Medium Spending Phase:**
    *   Example: Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> ($5,000 monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, possibly due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs reduce further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Food costs remain stable or decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Spending on travel reduces, with a greater focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

*   **Later Retirement (After 75 years) - Low Spending Phase:**
    *   Example: Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> ($4,160 monthly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain stable for maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs are significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Food expenses are relatively low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Travel spending largely halts, with a focus on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Real-Life Client Observations

Financial planners observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Average Ranges:** Retirees typically spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Higher-End Households:** These households might spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Variability:** Spending can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Common Trend:** A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   This reduction is attributed to factors like lowering housing costs, decreased need for transportation, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends and typical spending patterns is crucial for [[calculating_and_planning_for_retirement_expenses | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] and making informed [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | financial decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

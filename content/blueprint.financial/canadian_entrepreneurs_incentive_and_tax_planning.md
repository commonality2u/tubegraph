The Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI) is a tax relief measure designed for business owners, introduced in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:08">[06:57:08]</a>. It aims to reduce the capital gains inclusion rate for eligible capital gains.

## Key Features of the Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive

The CEI reduces the capital gains inclusion rate to 1/3, or 33.33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:14">[07:04:14]</a>. This applies to a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:44">[07:08:44]</a>. The incentive is being phased in gradually, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching the full $2 million cap by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

### Example of CEI Application

Consider a small business owner with a $100,000 taxable capital gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:52">[07:22:52]</a>.
*   Under the CEI, only $33,600 would be included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:03">[07:27:03]</a>.
*   Without the CEI, based on the new 2/3 inclusion rate for corporations in 2025, $66,500 would be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:49">[07:31:49]</a>.

## CEI and Other Tax Planning Strategies

While the CEI reduces the inclusion rate, it does not address [[hidden_investment_taxes_in_canada|investment income taxation]], which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

### Comparison with Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

For many business owners, the [[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada|Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption]] (LCGE) often remains a more effective tool than the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:52">[07:43:52]</a>. The LCGE offers a complete exemption for eligible capital gains, particularly when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:30">[07:51:30]</a>.

By strategically allocating gains across shareholders, businesses can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:43">[07:58:43]</a>. This is considered a very nuanced area of tax planning, and combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:55">[08:06:55]</a>.

> [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_business_owners_in_canada|Sole proprietors and self-employed individuals]] are not affected by the corporate capital gains tax changes in 2025 and will still be taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate for capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>. This change is strictly for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:46">[02:01:46]</a>.

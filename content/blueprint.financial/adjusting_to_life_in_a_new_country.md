Moving abroad can be a significant life change, with nearly 40% of new Canadians considering leaving their province or the country due to skyrocketing living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While the idea of waking up to a sunrise in the mountains of Portugal or a sunset on the beach in Thailand is appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, successful adjustment hinges on careful planning, especially regarding finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Prioritizing What Matters Most

When considering a move, it's essential to understand that "no country is perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The key is to prioritize what truly matters to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It is suggested to select your top three to five factors and use them to evaluate potential countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Seven common factors people consider when [[factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | moving abroad]] include:
*   **Healthcare** You'll want access to good doctors and hospitals, and assurance that your health insurance will provide adequate coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **[[living_costs_and_quality_of_life_in_different_countries | Cost of Living]]** Understand expenses related to housing, groceries, and daily life to avoid financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Safety** Research crime rates, political stability, and potential natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Job Market** Assess opportunities for job hunting or remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_residency_and_tax_laws_in_a_new_country | Visa]] and [[pathways_to_gaining_citizenship_in_a_new_country | Citizenship]]** Consider the ease of obtaining and maintaining a visa, and the long-term citizenship process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_residency_and_tax_laws_in_a_new_country | Taxes]]** Investigate income and property tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Weather** Especially for Canadians, the climate is a significant factor, with many seeking sunnier and warmer locales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

For example, an individual named Homer prioritized healthcare, cost of living, and safety, leading him to consider Spain, Portugal, and New Zealand, while steering clear of Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico due to concerns in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Dividend Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are popular in [[overview_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canada]], but their value is influenced by factors like fees and diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding how these elements affect returns is crucial for investors.

## Higher Fees Impact Returns

One significant downside of many dividend ETFs in [[overview_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canada]] is their higher management expense ratios (MERs), which can substantially reduce investment returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. These fees, which add up over the long term, are comparable to [[high_fees_associated_with_mutual_funds | high fees associated with mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

For instance:
*   **iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)**: Charges a 0.55% MER annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This means an investment of $1,000 in XDV incurs $5.50 in fees per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)**: Has an MER of 0.72%, with an additional 0.2% trading expense ratio, bringing the total cost to 0.92% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This makes ZWC the most expensive ETF on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **iShares S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)**: Features an MER of 0.66%, which is slightly higher than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

To mitigate the impact of fees, it is advisable to seek out dividend ETFs with lower MERs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

*   **Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VDY)**: Stands out with a relatively low MER of 0.22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XEI)**: Has the lowest MER on the list at 0.11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Limited Diversification in Canadian Dividend ETFs

Despite holding multiple stocks, many Canadian dividend ETFs offer less diversification than investors might expect, primarily due to heavy concentration in specific sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

*   **Financials and Energy Dominance**: Most listed Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily weighted towards financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
    *   **XDV** has nearly 60% of its portfolio in Canadian banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
    *   **VDY** has over 85% exposure to financials and energy, making it susceptible to downturns in these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   **ZWC** and **XEI** also have significant weightings in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Limited Number of Holdings**:
    *   **XDV** holds only 31 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   **XEI** is concentrated in just 20 holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   This limited number of holdings means these ETFs do not provide broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

In contrast, truly diversified ETFs like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) hold over 13,000 stocks across various sectors and geographies, offering significantly broader market exposure than typical Canadian dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. For those seeking true diversification, dividend ETFs alone might not be sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Overall Perspective

While [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] can be convenient for investors who prefer not to select individual dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, their higher fees and limited diversification are significant drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Some [[alternative_investment_strategies_to_dividend_etfs | alternative investment strategies to dividend ETFs]] include:
*   **Building a personal portfolio**: Investing directly in 10-20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canadian and U.S. markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Globally Diversified ETFs**: Opting for [[benefits_of_using_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] like VGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **U.S. Dividend Stocks**: Considering U.S. dividend stocks, which often offer higher dividend growth rates, greater sector diversification, and include more global "blue chip" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Holding U.S. dividend stocks in an RRSP rather than a [[high_fees_impacting_tfsa_growth | TFSA]] can help avoid withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Despite their convenience, Canadian dividend ETFs present concerns regarding high fees, lack of diversification, and reduced investor control over specific holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

To effectively reach a significant TFSA goal, such as $1 million, it's crucial to avoid certain common investment [[common_mistakes_and_misconceptions_about_the_tfsa | mistakes]] that can hinder growth or lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Mistake 1: [[risks_of_treating_tfsa_as_a_savings_account | Investing Only in a Savings Account]]
A significant mistake is treating your TFSA as solely a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While safe, this approach yields very low returns, making it extremely difficult to achieve substantial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario**: If you have an initial $95,000 in your TFSA, contribute $7,000 annually, and earn a low 2% interest rate, it would take a remarkable 56 years to reach $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. In this scenario, you would have contributed a total of $487,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: This strategy is impractical due to the extended timeline and high total contributions required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Starting at age 25, you would be 81 by the time you reached $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: A recent survey indicates that 47% of Canadian TFSA holders maintain only cash and savings in their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This means many Canadians may never achieve their $1 million goal, even if they consistently maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Mistake 2: [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_tfsa | Taking on Way Too Much Risk]]
On the opposite end of the spectrum, another [[common_mistakes_and_misconceptions_about_the_tfsa | common mistake]] is engaging in excessively high-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While the allure of rapid, spectacular gains can be strong, the probability of complete loss is exceptionally high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario**: An investor with $95,000 who consistently doubles their money with a 100% return annually could hypothetically reach $1 million in just 3 to 4 years, having invested only $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: Although this sounds appealing, it's a terrible strategy for the vast majority of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The chances of losing all invested capital are extremely high, rendering the entire strategy worthless if you cannot recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Investment Philosophy**: As Warren Buffett famously stated, "Rule number one: Never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> This emphasizes the critical importance of preserving capital over chasing unlikely spectacular gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Finding the Middle Ground
To successfully reach your TFSA goals within a reasonable timeframe, it's essential to find a balance between risk and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

*   **Risk Tolerance**: Begin by determining your personal risk tolerance, which can be assessed using free online questionnaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Investments**: Select investments that align with your risk tolerance and can help you achieve your goals within a reasonable timeframe, while also consistently contributing to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Investing, like driving, requires choosing the right path: The highway might be faster, but speeding brings higher risks. A slower back road is safer but takes longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Similarly, higher returns in investing often accompany higher risks, while safer investments offer more consistent but lower returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The objective is to avoid being overly risky to prevent losing your money, but still ensure sufficient returns to meet your goals efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

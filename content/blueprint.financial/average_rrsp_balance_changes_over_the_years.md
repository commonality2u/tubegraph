The average Canadian RRSP balance experienced a significant drop of over $30,000 in just one year, from 2022 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While this might seem concerning for retirement savings, the decline is not as severe as it initially appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Historical Averages and Recent Trends

Between 2022 and 2023, the average RSP account values saw a 28% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The national average dropped to $113,000 in 2023, down from approximately $144,000 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This reduction brings RSP balances closer to their historical averages, suggesting that the elevated levels observed in 2021 and 2022 were likely temporary spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These spikes were attributed to pandemic-related savings habits, as individuals cut expenses and increased contributions to their retirement funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The 2023 decline reflects a return to more typical savings levels after the pandemic-induced boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Despite continued focus on financial futures, the rising cost of living and [[impact_of_inflation_and_economic_factors_on_rrsp_savings | inflation]] are making it challenging to maintain higher contribution levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_median_and_average_rrsp_savings | Comparison Between Median and Average RRSP Savings]]

To offer a more realistic snapshot of Canadians' savings, recent median data for RRSPs, RRIFs, and LRAs (from Stats Canada's 2019 information) has been compiled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Medians are considered better indicators than averages, which can be skewed by high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Key Takeaways on Median vs. Average

*   There is a significant difference between median and average balances, particularly for those aged 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For this age group, the median is $224,000, while the average is $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This indicates that average numbers are heavily influenced by high-income outlier earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The median is a more suitable comparison for most individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### RRSP Holdings by Age Group (Median Data)

*   **Under 35:** The median saved is just $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Many young adults have very little saved, emphasizing the importance of consistent early saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **35 to 54 (Midlife):** Savings improve, but the median of $30,000-$70,000 is still well below what is typically required for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Juggling mortgages, family expenses, and careers often makes it difficult to prioritize retirement contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **55 to 64 (Nearing Retirement):** The median savings grow to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, this is generally insufficient for a comfortable retirement. While some are better off with an average of over $216,000, many will still need additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **65+ (Retirees):** The median savings remain at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This indicates that many retirees heavily rely on government benefits like CPP and OAS, as private savings often do not cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Impact of Economic Family Types on Savings

The data on RRSP holdings includes both combined households and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Households typically have higher savings due to shared financial responsibilities and additional incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Individuals should be aware that the reported averages might be higher than what most single persons accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## [[regional_differences_in_rrsp_balances_across_canada | Regional Differences in RRSP Balances Across Canada]]

A 2023 survey revealed variations in RRSP engagement across Canadian regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:
*   **Ontario** leads with the highest average RSP balance at $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Canada** boasted the highest average contribution at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
Despite regional variations, Canadians across the country remain engaged with their RRSPs, whether by building larger account balances or making consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## How Household Sizes Impact RRSP Contributions

Larger households tend to contribute more to their RRSPs, likely due to increased combined income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Two-person households** lead with 4.2 million households contributing and a median contribution of $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Single-person households** contribute significantly less overall, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

This pattern suggests that dual-income households are often better positioned to prioritize and grow their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Financial planning, especially for retirement, is often influenced by household dynamics and available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## RRSP Contributions at Different Stages of Life

Despite [[impact_of_inflation_and_economic_factors_on_rrsp_savings | inflation]] and rising costs, Canadians prioritized their RRSP contributions in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The average contribution grew to $6,510, up from $5,750 in 2022, demonstrating a steady focus on retirement savings amidst economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Contribution amounts vary by age group:
*   **55 and above:** Contribute a median of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **15 to 24:** Contribute a median of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This shows that as Canadians approach retirement, they prioritize growing their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The data indicates a clear focus on long-term financial security, whether starting with smaller contributions early on or making larger contributions later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Economic Challenges Impacting RRSP Savings

Saving for retirement has faced headwinds recently due to economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   In 2023, 74% of Canadians expressed concerns about how [[impact_of_inflation_and_economic_factors_on_rrsp_savings | inflation]] and rising prices affected their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   By 2024, 63% of Canadians still reported that current economic conditions negatively impacted their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Despite these challenges, Canadians show resilience by continuing to focus on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Regular RRSP contributions are crucial for long-term security, even in challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

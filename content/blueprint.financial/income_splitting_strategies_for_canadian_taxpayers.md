[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is a strategy that allows couples to balance their income loads, similar to sharing an umbrella in the rain, to take advantage of lower tax brackets and potentially save thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This involves shifting income from a higher-income partner to a lower-income partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Key categories for tax savings in Canada include:
*   Saving taxes on investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>
*   [[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>

## Strategies for [[income_splitting_strategies | Income Splitting]]

### Using the FHSA (First Home Savings Account)

The FHSA can be used for [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]], a strategy that may be under the radar due to the account's relative newness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] How it works
> The high-income partner gifts money to the low-income partner, who then contributes it to their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This avoids taxable investments for the low-income partner and provides a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
>
> For example, if Jerry gives $8,000 to Elaine, and Elaine contributes it to her FHSA, she receives a $2,400 tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This can result in a total tax saving of $2,532 because the investments grow tax-free within the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

This strategy is effective due to immediate tax savings, tax-free growth, and the flexibility to roll the FHSA into an RRSP if it's not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It's most beneficial when the higher-income partner has already maximized their registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### [[pension_income_splitting | Splitting Pension Income]]

[[pension_income_splitting_strategies | Shifting pension income]] to a lower-income spouse helps balance taxable income and reduces household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Eligibility Rules
> *   **Before age 65:** Only defined benefit pension plans (DBPs) qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
> *   **After age 65:** Defined contribution pension plans, RRIFs, and LIRAs also qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If Jerry earns $40,000 from his pension, taxed at 30%, and allocates $20,000 of it to Elaine, who is taxed at 15%, their household taxes can be reduced from $12,000 to $9,000, saving $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Spousal RRSP Contributions

Spousal RRSPs allow the higher-income partner to contribute to the lower-income spouse's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This defers taxes and helps balance retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Jerry contributes $12,000 to Elaine's RRSP, which reduces his taxable income by $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. When Elaine withdraws the funds at a 20% tax rate, they save $1,800 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pro Tip
> Avoid early withdrawals within three years of contribution to prevent the income from being attributed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### CPP [[income_splitting_strategies | Income Splitting]]

Couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can split up to 50% of their benefits, thereby lowering their overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Jerry shifts $3,000 of his CPP income to Elaine, saving $450 in taxes by leveraging her lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Splitting Capital Losses

This strategy involves offsetting one spouse's capital gains with the other's capital losses, using superficial loss rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If Jerry has a $4,000 capital loss early in the year from selling stock, this can offset Elaine's $15,000 capital gain, saving $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pro Tip
> This applies only to non-registered accounts and must comply with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules regarding timing and holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Hiring a Family Member (Self-Employed [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_canadians | Tax Strategy]])

For self-employed business owners, including those in the gig economy like Uber or DoorDash drivers, hiring a family member can be an effective [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

By paying a spouse or family member a reasonable salary for their contributions to the business, income is shifted to someone in a lower tax bracket, saving the family money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 at a 20% tax rate, your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This results in $10,500 in savings for you, while your spouse only pays $6,000 in taxes on their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The net family tax savings is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Important
> The salary paid must be reasonable; the CRA is strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. For example, paying a spouse $100,000 for basic data entry would not be considered reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can be penalized and taxed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) if contributions are made by a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This falls under the umbrella of [[consequences_of_overcontributing_to_your_tfsa | overcontribution]] to a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Understanding Non-Resident TFSA Contributions

A significant pitfall for TFSA holders is contributing to the account when they are no longer considered a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If an individual moves abroad for work or a new adventure but continues to contribute to their TFSA, the CRA can impose penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

The CRA will levy a 1% monthly penalty on every dollar contributed while the individual was living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This is because non-residents are generally not allowed to contribute to a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Case Study: Jessica's Experience

Consider Jessica, who moved to the United States for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Unaware of the rules regarding [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | nonresident status]] and TFSA contributions, she continued to contribute $6,000 to her TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The CRA charged her a 1% monthly penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Because she was not residing in Canada, she did not realize her mistake for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This oversight resulted in thousands of dollars in penalties accumulating over those years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Avoiding This Pitfall

To avoid such penalties, it is crucial to understand the rules regarding your residency status and its impact on your TFSA contributions. Always verify your eligibility to contribute if your residency status changes to prevent unexpected tax implications.

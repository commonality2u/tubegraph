Depreciation, also known as Capital Cost Allowance (CCA), is a significant tax write-off for small businesses in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. It allows businesses to deduct the cost of assets over several years, rather than in the year of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

## How CCA Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>
When a business purchases assets such as computers, machinery, or furniture, the full cost cannot be deducted in the year of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Instead, the cost is depreciated over time through CCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) categorizes different types of assets into specific classes, each with its own rate of depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Applying the correct class and rate is crucial for accurate deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

## Examples of Asset Classes and Rates
*   **Computers** are typically categorized under Class 50, with a 55% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   **Furniture** generally falls under Class 8, with a 20% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

### Calculation Example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>
If you purchase a computer for $2,000, and it falls under Class 50 (55% depreciation rate):
*   In the first year, you can claim 55% of $2,000, which amounts to $1,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   The remaining balance can be depreciated in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Vehicle Depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>
Depreciation is also deductible for vehicles used for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:27">[02:24:27]</a>. However, there are specific rules, particularly for luxury cars, where the maximum cost claimed for depreciation is capped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. As of the latest update, the limit for luxury car depreciation is $36,000 plus sales tax, at a 30% CCA rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Depreciation in Business Acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>
When acquiring another business, the purchase price is allocated among the various assets acquired, such as inventory, equipment, and goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. These assets can then be depreciated over time, providing ongoing deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Properly valuing and categorizing these assets is essential, as misclassification can lead to incorrect deductions and potential issues with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. It is highly advised to work with a professional appraiser or accountant during the acquisition process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

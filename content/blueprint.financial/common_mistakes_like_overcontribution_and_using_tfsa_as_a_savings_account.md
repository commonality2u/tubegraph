Unknowingly making the wrong moves with your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can cost you thousands of dollars down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The good news is that most of these [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_a_tfsa | common mistakes to avoid when investing in a TFSA]] are easy to fix, often in just 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Naming a Beneficiary Instead of a Successor

This is one of the easiest, yet most impactful, [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_a_tfsa | mistakes to correct]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. If you are married or in a common-law relationship, you should name your spouse as a successor holder for your TFSA, not just a beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

For example, if Jack has a TFSA with $100,000 and names his spouse Jill as a beneficiary, when Jack passes away, Jill inherits the $100,000, but the TFSA is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Jill then has to transfer the funds to a non-registered account, and any future gains on that money become subject to tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Additionally, the TFSA contribution room is lost forever, meaning future growth isn't tax-sheltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. If Jill earns a 5% annual return, she could owe taxes on $5,000 of gains each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

However, if Jack names Jill as a successor holder, she will take over the TFSA completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The $100,000 stays in the TFSA, and any future gains remain tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Jill's own TFSA contribution room remains unaffected, allowing her to continue contributing to her own account while benefiting from the tax-free growth of Jack's TFSA as if it were her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. With the same 5% return, Jill would not owe any taxes on the $5,000 annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

To fix this, contact your bank or TFSA provider and ask to update your account, naming your partner as a successor holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This 10-minute task can save your loved ones from losing out on significant tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Not Coordinating Your TFSA with Your Overall Financial Picture

Not coordinating your TFSA with other accounts, such as your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP), can lead to missed opportunities and less efficient tax strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Treating your TFSA in isolation, despite its flexibility and power, could cost you in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

For instance, if you are in a high 35% tax bracket, contributing $10,000 to your RRSP instead of your TFSA could save you $3,500 in taxes immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. That RRSP tax savings can be reinvested, growing your wealth, or even reinvested in your TFSA in retirement when you are in a lower tax bracket (e.g., 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Similarly, delaying your CPP from age 60 to 70 can boost your monthly benefit significantly, from around $640 to $1,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Using TFSA withdrawals during that period can cover the income gap without increasing your taxable income, keeping you in a lower tax bracket and avoiding the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Many clients who focused on maxing out their TFSA but overlooked their RRSP could have saved thousands more in taxes by balancing contributions between both accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Being Too Risky in Your Investments (Swinging Too Hard for the Fences)

Being overly aggressive with investments in your TFSA is a [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_tfsa | common mistake]], particularly among younger investors eager to achieve quick gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Investing heavily in high-risk options like meme stocks, cryptocurrencies, or penny stocks with the hope of doubling money overnight often backfires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

These investments are incredibly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The more you gamble, the greater your chances of losing big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. As Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, wisely stated, "The big money is not in the buying and selling but in the waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. If your goal is financial security, you need a strategy that balances risk with reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

For instance, if you contribute $10,000 to your TFSA and invest it in a high-risk asset that drops by 50%, you are left with only $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The critical drawback in a TFSA is that you cannot claim this loss on your taxes, and you do not get back the contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. That lost space is gone forever, reducing your future tax-free growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The key is balance; slow, steady, and consistent growth is the smartest way to build real wealth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Investing in a TFSA Before Paying Off High-Interest Debt

It might seem smart to start investing in your TFSA right away, but if you are carrying high-interest debt like credit card balances, it is better to deal with that first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Credit card interest rates can hit 20% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, and it is incredibly tough for any investment to consistently earn returns that high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For context, Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, has delivered an average annual return of around 20% since 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

By focusing on paying off high-interest debt, you are effectively "earning" a 20% return on your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This not only saves a significant amount on interest payments but also puts you in a much stronger financial position once that debt is cleared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Once debt-free, you will have more freedom to invest effectively without the burden of high-interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Using Your TFSA as Just a Savings Account

One of the most insidious [[common_mistakes_and_misconceptions_about_the_tfsa | mistakes]] is using your TFSA as merely a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. While keeping money in a savings account might seem safe, this approach can hinder your wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Inflation gradually erodes the purchasing power of your money, meaning your savings might not keep up with rising costs over time, especially in a big bank's savings account with very low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This is one of the most common [[risks_of_treating_tfsa_as_a_savings_account | risks of treating TFSA as a savings account]].

Consider investing in equities like stocks or bonds within your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. These investment options have the potential for higher returns, helping your money grow more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. For example, $10,000 invested at a 2% interest rate for 20 years would yield about $14,857, but the same amount with an average return of 5% would result in approximately $26,532 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This substantial difference can significantly impact your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. If you must keep money in a savings account, opt for a high-interest savings account offered by institutions like EQ Bank or Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Ignoring Foreign Dividend Taxes in Your TFSA

Investing in foreign assets, such as US or international stocks, through your TFSA is generally a good move, but many people overlook the impact of withholding taxes on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Some countries, like the US, impose a 15% tax on dividends paid to foreign investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. While your TFSA is tax-free in Canada, it is not recognized as such internationally, meaning you cannot recover that 15% tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. For example, if you earn $1,000 in dividends from US stocks held in your TFSA, $150 will be automatically withheld with no way to get it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

This withholding tax applies only to dividends, not capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Investing in US stocks can still be beneficial, but if you have room in your RRSP, it might be a better place for these investments due to tax treaties that often allow you to avoid or reclaim withholding taxes on foreign dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. A simple workaround for TFSA investments in US stocks is to hold mostly growth stocks that do not pay dividends, which will remain completely tax-free upon sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Overcontribution Mistakes

[[Consequences of overcontributing to your TFSA | Overcontributing to your TFSA]] can quickly lead to huge penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Any amount over your TFSA limit gets hit with a 1% monthly penalty on the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Fixing it often means withdrawing the overcontribution and potentially having to negotiate with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), which is a waste of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Here are three common "gotchas" that lead to [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | TFSA overcontribution penalties]]:

*   **Trusting the CRA's Contribution Limits**
    The CRA's website may not always reflect recent transactions, which can lead to accidental overcontributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. It is much better to keep your own records, whether a spreadsheet or quick note, to know exactly how much room you have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Re-contributing in the Same Year**
    If you withdraw money from your TFSA and then re-contribute it in the same year, it does not reset your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The room from a withdrawal is not restored until the next calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. If you are at your limit and contribute too soon, you could face penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. It is best to wait until the following year to re-contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Not Transferring Investments in Kind**
    When moving investments between accounts, selling them first can lead to overcontribution issues if you re-deposit the money into your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. To avoid this, you can transfer investments "in kind" without selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Even then, be cautious about timing to avoid unintentionally reducing your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Not Understanding the Technical Side of the TFSA

Many people miss out on the full potential of their TFSAs by not fully understanding how it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

*   **Knowing Exactly What You Can Invest In**
    Not all investments are allowed in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Some private or foreign assets might be prohibited, and investing in them could lead to penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A little research can save you from costly mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Gains and Losses Don't Impact Your Contribution Room**
    A common misconception is that investment gains or losses in your TFSA affect your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The truth is that they do not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Your room is based only on your deposits and withdrawals, not how much your investments perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **You're Not Limited by Your Bank**
    Many people mistakenly believe they have to stick with their bank's investment options for their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Banks often put clients into high-cost mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. You can explore platforms like Questrade, Wealthsimple, or EQ Bank, which often offer more options and lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Taking the time to shop around can improve your returns and broaden your investment choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Avoiding these [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investment | common mistakes in TFSA investment]] is key to growing your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

In Canada, while healthcare is supposedly free, out-of-pocket medical expenses can still add up significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claim some of these costs]] on their taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_canada | Medical Expense Tax Credit]] (METC) allows Canadians to [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_Canada | claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When claiming, only the portion not reimbursed by insurance can be claimed, and the lesser of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) must be subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Medical Travel Expenses

If you need to travel for medical care, your travel costs may be claimed as a [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_canada | medical expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Eligibility Criteria
This applies if:
*   You travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   The medical services are not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Eligible Costs
[[specific_deductions_for_vehicle_and_travel_expenses | Eligible travel expenses]] include:
*   **Transportation**
    *   Public transportation such as bus, train, taxi, or flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Vehicle expenses such as fuel, parking, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Lodging**
    *   Accommodation like a hotel stay or Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

    *   Meals are claimable when required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Example: Jennifer's Travel Expenses
Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   Gas and parking: $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Meals and accommodations: $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   Total travel expenses: $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>

To calculate her claim:
1.  3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
2.  Eligible claim: $2,300 (total expenses) - $1,650 (3% income threshold) = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
Jennifer can claim $650 of expenses on her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Pro Tip
> [!NOTE] Accompanied Person
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanied person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Record Keeping
Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct the premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Eligible Premiums
This includes plans that cover:
*   Medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   Dental expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   Vision expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   Prescription drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>
*   Hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

### Exclusions and Special Cases
*   Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed, provided they cover [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_Canada | eligible expenses]] and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children, which can help [[maximizing_medical_expense_claims_for_families | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Example: Mark's Insurance Premiums
Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
1.  3% of his income ($90,000) is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
2.  Eligible claim: $3,500 (premiums) - $2,700 (3% income threshold) = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Pro Tip
> [!NOTE] Mixed Plans
> If you are paying for a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, check which portion of your premiums is [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_Canada | eligible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Make sure you keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

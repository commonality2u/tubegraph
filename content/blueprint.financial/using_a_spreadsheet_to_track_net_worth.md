Tracking financial goals significantly increases the likelihood of achieving them, with one study from Michigan State University suggesting it makes individuals 33% more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Personal finance management can be transformed by [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | tracking net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, helping individuals [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_data | grow their wealth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A free, customizable spreadsheet with a visual dashboard is available to facilitate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?

Tracking net worth is comparable to tracking weight loss; small, consistent actions lead to substantial results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania showed that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw significant outcomes, with those tracking 40% of the time losing 5% of their weight in six months, and those tracking 70% of the time losing 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The key takeaway is that tracking correlates with goal success, even when imperfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

This principle applies directly to finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By tracking net worth monthly or quarterly, individuals can identify trends, [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_data | make smarter decisions]], and stay on track towards financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Consistency, not perfection, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Tracking net worth is like steering a ship with a compass; without it, one cannot identify if they are drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## The Free Spreadsheet Tracker

A simple Google Sheet simplifies the process of tracking net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Initial setup takes about 10-20 minutes, and [[steps_to_update_and_maintain_a_net_worth_tracker | monthly updates]] only take about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The tracker allows users to input their current net worth, set a net worth goal, and visualize the shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Initial Setup Steps

1.  **Download and Copy**: Obtain the Google Sheet by accessing the provided link, then go to "File" and "Make a copy" to save it to your own computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Rename**: Rename the copied file, ideally including the current year (e.g., "2025 net worth tracker") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Set Start Month**: In the "Inputs" tab, set the start month to the beginning of your current year, even if starting mid-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Set Net Worth Goal**: Input your desired net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. For guidance on setting a goal, refer to videos on the [[Understanding Net Worth Classes in Canada | average net worth in Canada]] and the [[Importance of reaching a 100000 net worth | impact of reaching $100,000 net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
5.  **Set Monthly Reminder**: Set a recurring monthly reminder (e.g., on the first of each month) to update the tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Populating the Spreadsheet

The spreadsheet is designed for both single individuals and households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

*   TDSP (savings for kids) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>
*   Wealthsimple TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>

*   Car loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>

## Analyzing the Dashboard

After populating the data, the dashboard provides a valuable overview:
*   **Current Net Worth**: Displays the total net worth, assets, and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Goal & Shortfall**: Shows the set goal and the remaining amount needed to reach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: This graph becomes insightful with more data, showing the gradual increase or any dips in net worth throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Identifying dips allows for investigation into their causes (e.g., market fluctuations, re-evaluation of risk tolerance for high-risk assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Assets vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Visualizes the proportion of current versus long-term assets and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Detailed progress for each month, including percentage increases or decreases in net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

## Annual Review and Archiving

After each year's data is filled out and analyzed, it's recommended to create a new copy of the spreadsheet for the subsequent year (e.g., 2026, 2027) and delete the old data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. This allows for [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | comparing annual performance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Alternative Net Worth Tracking Tools in Canada

While spreadsheets offer full control and customization, several other tools are available for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. [[comparisons_between_free_and_paid_net_worth_tracking_tools | Each comes with its own costs or limitations]]:

*   **Wealthsimple**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview of net worth. However, advanced features are behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.
*   **Quicken (formerly Mint)**: Mint, once a popular free option in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription. While comprehensive, the cost may not be justified if free alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app that monitors spending and manages finances. It offers a free version, but premium features require a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

## Advantages of the Spreadsheet Method

The custom spreadsheet method is favored for being completely free, offering full control, and being highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The act of [[steps_to_update_and_maintain_a_net_worth_tracker | manually updating the spreadsheet monthly]] is considered rewarding, keeping individuals engaged with their finances and providing a clear visual overview of their net worth goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. While automated tools like Wealthsimple, Quicken, and PocketGuard offer convenience, they incur costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. A spreadsheet, conversely, is free and places the user entirely in charge of their tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

As Peter Drucker stated, "What gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Tracking net worth is a simple step that can lead to significant financial achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.

The future of the capital gains tax in Canada is uncertain, depending on various legal and [[political_challenges_facing_the_capital_gains_tax_hike | political developments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. There are three primary possible outcomes for the tax increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Best-Case Scenario: Full Reversal

This outcome involves a complete rollback of the capital gains tax hike, either through judicial review or a change in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Judicial Review Success**: If the judicial review of the tax increase succeeds, courts could block the CRA from enforcing the higher inclusion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This would effectively reverse the tax hike even before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **New Government**: Should Pierre Poilievre win the next election and follow through on his promise, the capital gains inclusion rate would likely revert to 50% for all taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This scenario would benefit [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | investors]], [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | business owners]], and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Middle Ground: Partial Rollback or Temporary Freeze

This scenario involves a less extensive change to the capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Poilievre's Potential Action**: If elected, Poilievre might lower the inclusion rate but not fully restore it to 50%, potentially applying different rules for corporations versus individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Liberal Leadership Shift**: A new Liberal leader, if distancing themselves from the tax, might reduce the inclusion rate slightly without fully returning it to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Worst-Case Scenario: No Reversal

This outcome entails the capital gains tax increase remaining in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

*   **Legal Challenges Fail**: If the courts rule in favor of the government, the CRA would continue collecting at the higher rate, and the inclusion increase would remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Political Promises Unfulfilled**: Even if Poilievre wins, the tax might stay in place if he doesn't follow through on his promise due to economic pressures or competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Liberals Retain Power**: If the Liberals remain in power, a reversal of the tax might be off the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. In this case, businesses and investors would need to adjust to the new tax reality and plan accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Estimated Probabilities

Despite the high likelihood of a full reversal, [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | investors]] and [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | business owners]] should prepare for multiple outcomes, as legal battles and political promises do not always translate into quick policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

Given the widespread opposition to the capital gains tax increase, the multiple legal and [[political_challenges_facing_the_capital_gains_tax_hike | political challenges]] it faces, the [[deferral_of_canadian_capital_gains_tax_increase | new deferral]] to January 1, 2026, and new tariffs imposed by Donald Trump, the following probabilities are estimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>:

*   **80% chance** of a full reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **5% chance** of a partial rollback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **15% chance** that the tax remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

It is recommended that [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | investors]] and [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | business owners]] prepare for all scenarios by staying informed about court rulings, political shifts, and election timelines, as any reversal will likely take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Using tax-efficient strategies like maximizing TFSAs, RRSPs, and corporate structures can help reduce taxable [[capital_gains_and_losses_management_for_tax_savings | capital gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. For those considering selling assets like businesses or real estate, it's prudent to consider whether to sell now in case the tax is implemented in the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

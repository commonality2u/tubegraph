The Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) is a powerful tool designed to provide significant financial support for Canadians with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. It offers substantial government grants and bonds to help families build financial security for a loved one with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## What is the RDSP?
The RDSP is specifically categorized as a long-term disability savings vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It is considered a crucial exception to the general prioritization of other savings accounts like the FHSA, TFSA, and RSP, due to the "free money" opportunities it presents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Key Government Grants and Bonds
The RDSP offers two primary government incentives:

### Canada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG)
*   The CDSG provides matching contributions from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   It matches 300% on the first $500 contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   It matches 200% on the next $1,000 contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Account holders can receive up to $3,500 per year from the CDSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Canada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB)
*   The CDSB provides up to $1,000 annually without requiring any personal contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Example of Combined Benefits
If an individual contributes $1,500 to an RDSP, they could receive:
*   Up to $3,500 from the CDSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   An additional $1,000 from the CDSB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
This totals $4,500 in free government support each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Prioritizing the RDSP
Due to its generous government grants for disability savings, the RDSP should be prioritized first if you qualify for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This means it should come before other accounts such as the FHSA, TFSA, or RSP, especially when employer matching for an RSP is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

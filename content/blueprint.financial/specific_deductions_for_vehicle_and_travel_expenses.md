For Canadian small business owners, understanding and claiming specific deductions related to vehicle use and business travel can significantly reduce taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. These are considered some of the [[simple_tax_deductions_for_canadian_small_businesses | simplest tax deductions for small businesses in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Vehicle Expenses

If you use your vehicle for business purposes, such as visiting clients, picking up supplies, or other business-related travel, you can deduct a portion of the associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### What is Deductible?
Eligible deductions for business vehicle use include:
*   Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Lease payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Parking fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

### Calculating Your Claim
To calculate your deduction, determine the percentage of your total driving that was for business purposes and apply that percentage to your overall vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

> **Example:**
> If you spent $10,000 on your vehicle last year, drove a total of 20,000 km, and 5,000 km were for business, then 25% of your vehicle expenses are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This would result in a $2,500 write-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Specific Rules for Certain Vehicles
There are specific rules for certain types of vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. For instance, if a luxury car is used, the maximum cost that can be claimed for depreciation is capped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. As of the latest update, the limit is $36,000 plus sales tax at a 30% Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Business Travel Expenses

If you travel for business purposes, a variety of associated costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### What is Deductible?
Deductible business travel costs include:
*   Transportation (e.g., airfare, taxi fares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
*   Accommodation (hotel stays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Incidentals (e.g., tips, internet fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>

> **Example:**
> If you travel to another city to meet a client, you can deduct your airfare, hotel stays, meals, and taxi fares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Key Requirement
The crucial factor for deducting travel expenses is that they must be directly related to your business activities and not for extravagant personal trips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

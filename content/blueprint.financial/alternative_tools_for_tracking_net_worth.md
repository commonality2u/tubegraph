From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

While a custom spreadsheet is a preferred method for tracking net worth, several other tools are available for Canadians, each with its own costs or limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The speaker is not affiliated with any of these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Wetha
Wetha connects to your financial accounts, offering an automatic overview of your [[importance_of_net_worth_over_income | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Although convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, certain advanced features require a paid subscription, which can accumulate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The speaker has used Wetha and found it to be a good option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Quicken (formerly Mint)
Mint, once a free and popular tool in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which now requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While Quicken provides robust [[financial_strategies_for_wealth_building | financial tracking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, its cost might not be justified given the availability of free alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The speaker has used Mint previously and liked it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Pocket Guard
Pocket Guard is a budgeting app designed to help monitor spending and manage finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. It offers a free version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, but access to premium features comes with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. It can be an option if you are comfortable paying for automated financial tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. The speaker has not personally used Pocket Guard but has heard positive feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Spreadsheet-Based Tracking
The speaker's personal preference is for a custom spreadsheet, as it is completely free, offers full control, and is highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Regularly updating the spreadsheet keeps the user engaged with their finances and provides a visual overview of their [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_financial_data | net worth goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Unlike automated tools like Wetha, Quicken, and Pocket Guard which incur costs, a spreadsheet offers a free and fully controlled [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | tracking process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

Despite concerns among 64% of Canadians that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) may not be available when they retire, influenced by factors like aging populations, rising costs, and discussions about Alberta potentially leaving the CPP, the plan is actually more secure than commonly perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Current Financial Strength

The [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | CPP]] has [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | outperformed expectations]] significantly. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | CPP Investments]] reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return, pushing the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This asset total far exceeds initial expectations; projections made in 2000 anticipated the [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] to reach $425 billion by 2023, but it instead hit $632 billion, surpassing projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This overperformance reflects [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | smart investment strategies]] and sound long-term decisions by fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even during challenging economic periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This robust [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | growth]] ensures the [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] can manage the increasing number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## [[CPP sustainability and longterm planning | Sustainability]] for Generations

The [[Future of Canada Pension Plan CPP | future of the Canada Pension Plan]] is evaluated for its ability to care for current and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The Chief Actuary of Canada conducts a detailed review of the [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP's financial health]] every three years, with the latest report indicating the [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] is on solid ground for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The fund, currently at $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, is projected for substantial [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | growth]]:
*   By 2030: Expected to reach about $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   By 2040: Projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   By 2050: Expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

These forecasts highlight the long-term [[CPP sustainability and longterm planning | potential sustainability of the CPP]], ensuring it is well-positioned to support both today's and future generations of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] is likely to remain financially stable for at least 75 years, suggesting solvency into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## [[Role of independent audits and oversight in CPP | Trustworthiness of Reporting]]

The reliability of [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] reports and audits is maintained through multiple safeguards:

### Chief Actuary of Canada
The Chief Actuary of Canada conducts the audits, providing an impartial assessment of the [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP's long-term financial health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Operating independently of political influence, the Chief Actuary ensures reports are accurate and free from external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The 31st Actuarial Report, completed in 2022, confirmed the [[CPP sustainability and longterm planning | CPP's sustainability]] for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)
The Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) reviews these reports, adding another layer of [[Role of independent audits and oversight in CPP | independent scrutiny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The PBO is known for being independent, transparent, and nonpartisan, serving as a reliable source of [[Role of independent audits and oversight in CPP | oversight]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Their primary role is to provide objective, factual analysis and ensure financial data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### External Audits
Further assurance comes from external audits. For example, Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | CPP Investments]] maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, reinforcing trust in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

These combined layers of scrutiny from the Chief Actuary, PBO, and external auditors provide strong reasons to trust the reliability and transparency of [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] is one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Always look for independent audits or third-party reviews when evaluating financial reports, whether for a pension fund or a company you plan to invest in. This is key to making informed decisions with trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

For the average Canadian, the trustworthiness of the [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP's reports]] means peace of mind, knowing the plan is reviewed by multiple independent bodies, thoroughly audited, and currently projected to last at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | Investment Performance and Management]]

The [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | performance and management of CPP Investments]] are critical to its long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:

*   **Strong Long-Term Returns**: [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | CPP Investments]] achieved a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This has pushed total assets to $632 billion, exceeding projections by over $150 billion, showcasing the success of its [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Diversified Global Portfolio**: The fund is globally diversified across 56 countries, investing in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. With only 12% of the portfolio in Canada, the rest is spread internationally, reducing home risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Active Management Strategy**: [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | CPP Investments]] employs an active management approach, investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity, aiming to outperform passive strategies over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While there may be years of underperformance (e.g., fiscal 2024's 8% net return versus a reference portfolio's 19.9% return), active management is essential for a pension fund like [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] to address the complexities of pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

The significant growth of [[CPPs financial stability and growth projections | CPP]] assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates sound [[Investment strategies and performance of CPP | investment management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

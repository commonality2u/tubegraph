Many individuals face the challenge of significant tax implications on their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) upon death, with balances potentially being taxed at the highest marginal rate of 53% in provinces like Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, an RRSP balance of $700,000 could result in a tax bill of $371,000, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. One effective strategy to mitigate this substantial tax burden is to use early RRSP withdrawals to fund a life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>

This strategy involves purchasing a permanent life insurance policy to protect your RRSP from a large tax hit upon your passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The death benefit from the life insurance policy is designed to cover the estate's tax liability, ensuring that your beneficiaries receive the full value of your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

A key aspect of this method is the funding of the life insurance premiums. Instead of paying premiums from existing assets, individuals can make small, gradual withdrawals from their RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This approach helps to spread out the tax burden associated with RRSP withdrawals over time, making the premium payments more manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This aligns with broader strategies for [[Managing RSP withdrawals for tax savings in retirement | managing RRSP withdrawals for tax savings in retirement]] by keeping taxable income within a lower bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Client Example: John and Mary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>

John, aged 72, and Mary, aged 70, had a joint RRSP balance of $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Without proper planning, their estate could have faced a tax bill of up to half a million dollars solely on their RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

To avoid this, they opted to purchase a joint last-to-die permanent life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The policy had a minimum death benefit of approximately $632,000, specifically calculated to cover the expected tax bill and provide additional funds for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The policy required annual premiums of $50,000 for the first six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. John and Mary chose to cover these premiums by withdrawing $50,000 annually from their RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This gradual withdrawal strategy allowed them to spread out the tax burden over time, avoiding a large lump-sum tax event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

After six years, the policy was fully paid up, and no further premiums were required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Ten years later, when John and Mary passed away, the policy had grown to over $777,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This tax-free life insurance payout covered their estate's entire RRSP tax bill, with extra funds remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

*   **Double Benefit:** The life insurance payout is entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Using RRSP withdrawals to fund premiums reduces the RRSP balance, thereby lowering the final tax liability at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This effectively trades RRSP income for tax-free growth within the life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Avoids Upfront Payments:** Funding premiums through gradual RRSP withdrawals helps avoid large upfront payments from existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Policy Paid Up:** After a set period (e.g., six years in the example), the policy can be fully paid up, eliminating further premium payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, while the life insurance payout continues to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>

*   **Eligibility for Life Insurance:** Not everyone qualifies for life insurance, especially those with pre-existing health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Taxation of Withdrawals:** The annual RRSP withdrawals used for premiums are taxed as income, which can increase tax liability during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning Required:** Precise planning is necessary to avoid paying too much tax due to these withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Combining Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>

The strategy of using early RRSP withdrawals to fund life insurance can be integrated with other financial planning approaches. For instance, in a common blueprint, a higher-earning spouse might contribute to a spousal RRSP for the lower-income spouse, who then makes withdrawals at a lower tax rate in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Simultaneously, the higher-earning spouse can make gradual RRSP withdrawals to spread out their own tax burden and use these withdrawals to cover life insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This layered approach helps to smooth out the overall tax burden and maximize inheritance for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

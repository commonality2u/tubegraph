Small business owners in Canada can maximize their savings by understanding and claiming various tax deductions, including those for home office and vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:00:23">[00:23]</a>. These are considered some of the simplest deductions, being easy to understand and quick to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:00:32">[00:32]</a>.

## Home Office Expenses

A significant deduction often overlooked by small business owners is for [[work_from_home_tax_deduction | home office expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:18">[01:18]</a>. This is particularly relevant given the increased transition to home offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:22">[01:22]</a>. If a portion of your home is used regularly and exclusively for business, you can deduct a percentage of your home's costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:26">[01:26]</a>.

Deductible costs include:
*   Mortgage interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:31">[01:31]</a>
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:32">[01:32]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:33">[01:33]</a>
*   Maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:34">[01:34]</a>

To calculate the claim, measure your workspace and divide it by the total square footage of your dwelling. This percentage is then applied to your total home costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:36">[01:36]</a>.

**Example:** If your home is 2,000 square feet and your office is 200 square feet, 10% of your home is used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:46">[01:46]</a>. If your total home expenses for the year are $2,000, you could claim $200 as a business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:01:55">[01:55]</a>. While the CRA doesn't have a strict maximum, some accountants suggest deducting up to 20-25% of your home without raising concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:02">[02:02]</a>.

## Vehicle Expenses

If you use your vehicle for business activities, such as visiting clients, picking up supplies, or other business-related travel, you can deduct a portion of the associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:11">[02:11]</a>.

Deductible vehicle expenses include:
*   Gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:20">[02:20]</a>
*   Repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:21">[02:21]</a>
*   Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:22">[02:22]</a>
*   Lease payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:23">[02:23]</a>
*   Parking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:23">[02:23]</a>
*   Toll fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:24">[02:24]</a>
*   Depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:25">[02:25]</a>

At the end of the year, calculate the percentage of your total driving that was for business and apply that percentage to your vehicle expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:27">[02:27]</a>.

**Example:** If you spent $10,000 on your vehicle last year, drove 20,000 km in total, and 5,000 km were for business, then 25% of your vehicle expenses ($2,500) are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:34">[02:34]</a>.

Specific rules apply to certain vehicle types. For luxury cars, the maximum cost you can claim for depreciation (at a 30% Capital Cost Allowance or CCA rate) is capped, with the latest update setting the limit at $36,000 plus sales tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:02:50">[02:50]</a>.

## Tracking Expenses

It is crucial to meticulously track all your business expenses to ensure accurate deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:36">[05:36]</a>. Technology, such as mileage tracking apps and expense categorization software, can significantly simplify this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:46">[05:46]</a>. Popular options include QuickBooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="HH:05:57">[05:57]</a>.

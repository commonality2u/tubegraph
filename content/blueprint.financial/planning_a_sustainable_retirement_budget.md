Understanding retirement spending is a common concern for individuals planning their post-work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. A key aspect of [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | comprehensive financial planning for retirement]] is to anticipate how your expenses will evolve through different life stages and phases of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, was $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. This equates to approximately $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

### Breakdown of Monthly Spending Categories

For retirees in Canada, expenditures are primarily allocated to specific categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>:

*   **Shelter:** This is the largest portion, covering main accommodation costs and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. On average, retirees spend about $13,814 annually on shelter, or $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This accounts for approximately 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Even with many retirees owning their homes, significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses even after a mortgage is paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Food:** A significant category, retirees spend approximately $7,677 annually on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This averages out to $639 per month, or 12.4% of their monthly spending, and includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Transportation:** While generally lower than for younger individuals, transportation still represents 8.8% of a retiree's monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Even with free healthcare in Canada, retirees allocate a higher portion to healthcare due to increased medical needs as they age, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions:** This category accounts for 5.4% of monthly spending, emphasizing the need for continued [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | financial security in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Household Operations:** Expenses for maintaining the home make up 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

## How Spending Changes Throughout Life

Household spending patterns change significantly as individuals progress through different phases of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Data from Stat Canada illustrates this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>:

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years):** Spending peaks during this period, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This increase is driven by greater family needs, including larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there's a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years):** Spending starts to decrease slightly, averaging about $99,250 annually or $8,271 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. There's also an increased focus on paying off mortgages and preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years):** Spending further reduces to an average of $61,800 annually, or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. The priority shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Transportation costs decline as work-related travel ceases, and there's less spending on luxuries, with a greater focus on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending generally occurs in three distinct phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

*   **High Spending (Early Retirement: 65-70 years):** In the early years, retirees often experience higher spending due to active lifestyles, travel, and new hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. For example, Alex, a Canadian retiree, spends about $70,000 annually ($5,833 monthly) in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Housing costs remain high (though mortgages may be paid off), transportation costs decrease significantly, and healthcare costs begin to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Spending on hobbies and travel is common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   **Medium Spending (Mid-Retirement: 70-75 years):** Spending typically decreases in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Alex's annual spending drops to around $60,000 ($5,000 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease (possibly due to downsizing), transportation costs further reduce, and healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Travel spending also reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Low Spending (Later Retirement: 75+ years):** In later retirement, annual spending drops further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Alex's spending falls to $50,000 per year ($4,166 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Housing costs remain stable for maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Transportation costs are significantly lower, and healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. Food expenses are relatively low, and travel spending largely ceases, with a focus on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

The overall pattern observed is that as retirees become less active, they tend to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

## Real-Life Insights from Clients

Observations from financial planners indicate a wide range of retirement spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

*   **Observed Spending Range:** On average, retirees may spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. High-end households might spend $5,000 to $9,000 per month or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. However, some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
*   **Common Spending Trend:** A consistent trend is that spending typically starts at a higher range in the early years of retirement and gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. There is often about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. For instance, an initial annual spending of $100,000 might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

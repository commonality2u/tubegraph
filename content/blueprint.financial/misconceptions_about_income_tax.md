A common misconception among Canadians is the belief that their entire salary becomes taxed at a higher rate when a raise pushes them into a new federal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | myth]] can lead individuals to feel as though they are losing money despite earning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How Tax Brackets Actually Work

The Canadian tax system does not tax an entire salary at the new, higher bracket rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Instead, it operates incrementally:

*   The portion of income up to the previous bracket's threshold is still taxed at its original, lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the additional income that falls *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

This means an individual's average or effective tax rate remains significantly lower than the highest marginal tax rate they reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

> For example, if an individual's salary increases from $55,000 to $60,000, moving them into a federal tax bracket where the rate is 20.5% for income above $57,375:
> *   The first $57,375 of their income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
> *   Only the extra $2,625 (the portion above $57,375) is taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
> *   The remainder of the income continues to be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Benefits of Income Growth

Even when entering a higher tax bracket, individuals will always take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This demonstrates the [[benefits_of_income_growth_despite_tax_increases | importance of income growth]], as more income is always advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Individuals should not allow [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | tax myths]] to deter them from pursuing raises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

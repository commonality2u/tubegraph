From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

When [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retiring abroad]], Canadians must understand how their government income, such as CPP, OAS, and GIS, is affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Some benefits may cease, others may be taxed differently, and some remain largely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is not portable and is intended to support low-income seniors residing in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Eligibility While Abroad
If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. There are no social security agreements to protect GIS; it is strictly tied to physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

> **Example:** Gan, a 71-year-old retiree, had her GIS terminated after moving to Mexico and staying outside Canada for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

If GIS is a crucial part of your [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement income]], it's important to consider this before relocating, as you may need to adjust your budget or explore other income options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Maintaining Part-Year Residency
Some retirees, known as "snowbirds," maintain part-year residency in Canada to retain healthcare and tax status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They ensure they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

[[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP benefits]] are based on contributions made during your working life in Canada, not on your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP benefits]] will continue to be paid regardless of where you live internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Tax Considerations
If you are considered a non-resident of Canada, your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP payments]] may be subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaties:** If Canada has a tax treaty with your new country of residence, the withholding tax could be reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For instance, the tax treaty with the US may allow you to avoid withholding tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **No Tax Treaty:** Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
It is essential to review your destination's tax treaty with Canada, as these agreements vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements
Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These agreements help avoid double contributions, ensure continuous [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP benefits]] coverage, and coordinate benefits if you have worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Other CPP Benefits
[[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP survivor benefits]] and child benefits also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Receiving Payments
You can have your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP payments]] direct deposited into a Canadian bank account, or in many countries, receive them in local currency through a local bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Checks in Canadian dollars can also be mailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Local Tax Laws
While your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP amount]] does not change, your new country of residence might tax those payments differently, so it is advisable to check local tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

[[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS benefits]] are based on residency, not work history or contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Eligibility and the 20-Year Rule
To qualify for [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS benefits]] while living outside Canada, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. If you meet this threshold, your monthly [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS payment]] will continue even if you reside permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

> **Example:** Pedro, who lived in Canada for 30 years after age 25, continues to receive his full [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS payments]] after retiring to Spain because he met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Less Than 20-Year Rule and Suspension
If you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure, your [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS benefits]] will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and reestablish residency to receive them again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements Exception
You might still qualify for [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS abroad]] if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time you lived in both countries totals at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, the years lived in another country do not increase your [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS amount]]; they only help determine eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Tax Considerations
[[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS payments]] are considered taxable income even when living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Withholding Tax:** If you live outside Canada, your [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS]] may be subject to a non-resident withholding tax, with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaties:** A tax treaty with Canada may reduce or eliminate this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example, the Canada-US tax treaty means [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS]] is not subject to withholding tax if you move to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, the Canada-Germany tax treaty allows Canada to tax public pensions like [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS]] at up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Tax Slips and Filing:** While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. You must continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. You can request voluntary tax deductions by logging into your My Service Canada account or filling out a specific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Managing the OAS Recovery Tax
To manage the [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS recovery tax]] (clawback), which begins at $93,454 in 2025, consider [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | managing taxable income]] through RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or [[changing_retirement_age_in_canada | deferring OAS to age 70]] for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Planning Strategies to Maximize Benefits

Effective [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | planning strategies]] are crucial to maximize benefits when [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retiring abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

> **Example: Anita's Retirement Plan**
> Anita, 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years in Canada. She qualified for CPP, OAS (due to crossing the 20-year residency threshold), and GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Portugal has a social security and tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
> *   **CPP:** Continued without interruption, with a reduced 15% withholding tax due to the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
> *   **OAS:** Continued because she met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
> *   **GIS:** Stopped after six months as it requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
>
> **Anita's Successes:**
> *   Delayed her move until she reached 20 years of Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
> *   Chose a treaty country (Portugal) to reduce tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
> *   Planned early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Summary of Benefits Abroad

Think of your Canadian benefits like travel companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:
*   **CPP:** Your "ride or die friend" that travels with you anywhere, though there may be a tax "fee" at your destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **OAS:** More "selective," only coming if you built a strong relationship (20+ years of residency after age 18) or have "mutual friends" (social security agreements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **GIS:** A friend that "loves Canada" and will "ghost you" after six months once you leave, with no treaty or workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Other Pro Tips for Retiring Abroad
*   **RRSPs:** Consider drawing down your RRSPs before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Plan for private healthcare, as provincial coverage typically ends after 6 to 7 months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

[[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | Retiring abroad]] involves more than just sunshine and [[cost_of_living_comparison_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | lower rent]]; understanding the financial rules is critical to avoid expensive consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

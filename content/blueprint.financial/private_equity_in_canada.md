Private equity refers to investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments often involve funding startups, financing turnarounds, or supporting business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Unlike traditional stocks, private equity carries higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, it also offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit their capital for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Private Equity and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs)

RSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments, meaning they do not typically allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means that, in most cases, [[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada | private equity]] investments need to be held outside an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Exceptions for RSPs

Despite these restrictions, certain self-directed RSPs provide access to private equity under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts allow investors to hold CRA-approved private equity funds, enabling them to enjoy tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Examples include the North Leaf Capital Partners private equity fund, a Canadian fund available to some RSP accounts, and select private equity investments offered by Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Downsides of Private Equity

Like any high-reward investment, [[risks_and_rewards_of_private_equity | private equity comes with notable drawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:

*   **High Fees**
    Private equity investments come with significant costs, including management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Understanding these expenses before investing is crucial, as they can dramatically reduce profits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **High Risk**
    These investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. There is always a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, many Canadian investors suffered losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture that fell under private equity real estate investing, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Long Lockup Periods**
    Investors must be prepared to commit their funds for extended periods, often between 5 to 10 years, before seeing any returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. During these periods, funds are inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Private equity is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are patient and strategic, it can be a powerful wealth-building tool beyond an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Private Equity in a Family Trust

A Family Trust can hold a variety of assets, including private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This makes it a very powerful tool for long-term financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

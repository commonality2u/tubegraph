## Pension Income Splitting

Pension income splitting is a significant tax-saving opportunity for retired couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06"></a>.

*   **Benefits** This strategy can save thousands of dollars by lowering the total household tax bill, resulting in more money in your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10"></a>.
*   **Common Oversight** Despite its potential for massive savings, many retirees do not utilize this option, either due to a lack of awareness or the incorrect assumption that it occurs automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24"></a>.
*   **Claiming the Benefit** To claim pension income splitting, you must complete and submit form T1032 with your tax return each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31"></a>.

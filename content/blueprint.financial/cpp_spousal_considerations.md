When planning your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) strategy, it's crucial to look beyond your individual benefits and consider how your decisions will affect your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Ignoring these factors can lead to missed tax savings or reduced financial support for your partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Pension Sharing (CPP Income Splitting)

One important aspect is pension sharing, also known as [[cpp_income_splitting | CPP income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This allows you and your spouse to split your CPP income, which can significantly help with [[tax_implications_of_cpp | taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

For instance, if one spouse receives $1,200 per month in CPP and the other receives almost nothing, they can potentially share their CPP so that each reports approximately $600 in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This can result in considerable savings and make your overall retirement income more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## CPP Survivor Benefit

Another critical factor to consider is the CPP Survivor Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This benefit provides ongoing income to your spouse if you pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The amount your spouse receives heavily depends on when you begin collecting your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Impact of Early CPP on Survivor Benefit

Starting your CPP benefits early can significantly reduce the amount your survivor receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. If you start your CPP at age 60, your monthly benefits are reduced by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Consider this example:
*   Your CPP benefit at age 65 would have been $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   By starting at age 60, it drops to $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   If you pass away, your spouse might receive 60% of that reduced amount, roughly $384 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   This is a significant difference compared to the $600 they could have received if you had waited until age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Ignoring these factors can mean your spouse receives less financial support if something happens to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Financial planning services often emphasize the impact of spousal CPP pension sharing to ensure both partners are taken care of and benefits are maximized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

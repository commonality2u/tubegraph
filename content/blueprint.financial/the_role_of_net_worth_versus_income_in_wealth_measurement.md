To understand what it takes to be wealthier than 99% of Canadians, it's essential to distinguish between income and net worth, as they represent different aspects of financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Income for the Top 1% in Canada

The top 1% income in Canada is determined by a threshold value, not the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   As of 2021, the median income for the top 1% in Canada was $378,900 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This figure represents the middle point of the top 1% earners, essentially the top 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   The actual threshold value to be considered in the top 1% of income earners in Canada is $271,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Crossing this threshold officially places an individual in this elite income group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Characteristics of Top Income Earners
*   Around 80% of individuals in the top 1% of income earners are married or in common-law relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Wages and salaries accounted for 63.1% of their income in 2021, a slight increase from 62.7% in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This indicates that approximately one-third of their income comes from sources outside of their primary jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This suggests that diversifying income sources is beneficial for reaching the top 1% income bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Net Worth for the Top 1% in Canada

[[canadian_net_worth_by_class | Net worth]] is defined as total assets minus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It is considered a more accurate measure of being in the top 1% than income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. An individual can be in the top 1% by income but not by [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   According to a 2021 report from the PBO, the threshold for being in the top 1% of [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] in Canada is having at least $6.3 million in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Approximately 160,000 families in Canada have achieved this [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Ways to Join the Top 1% in Canada

There are several ways individuals and families accumulate the significant wealth required to be in the top 1% [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Most people employ a combination of these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### 1. High-Paying Profession
Having a profession that provides a high income is a primary way to accumulate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. If an individual can earn an income close to the top 1% threshold of $271,600 per year, they have a strong chance of amassing $6 million by the end of their career to crack the top 1% in [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   **Examples of professions**: C-suite level executives (CEO, CFO, CTO), medical specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons), partners in law or accounting firms, investment bankers, principal software engineers, senior data scientists, and specialized dentists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   These jobs typically require many years of specialized education and work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 2. Starting a Business
Business ownership is a significant method for the top 1% to generate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. While not easy, starting a successful business is possible for anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The wealthiest Canadians often became so by founding businesses rather than working traditional 9-to-5 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

*   **Example**: Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify, propelled himself into the elite of Canadian wealth through the company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Business ownership offers financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits like selling the business or going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   The key to business wealth is the ability to scale, reaching hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Certain sales roles (e.g., real estate agents, mortgage brokers, pharmaceutical sales reps) can also achieve 1% income levels, acting as a hybrid between salary and business ownership due to commission-based earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### 3. Investing Wisely
[[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | Investing]] is crucial for reaching the top 1% [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]], as it allows money to compound and grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Even with a high income, unwise [[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | investing]] can hinder wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

*   **Example**: Ann Scheiber, an IRS auditor, retired with modest savings but built a $22 million fortune by consistently [[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | investing]] in blue-chip stocks with solid dividends and employing a buy-and-hold strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:07:13]</a>.

*   **Investment Strategies**:
    *   **Diversification**: Spreading investments across different asset classes is recommended for non-expert investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   **Stock Market**: Investing in the stock market, particularly through low-fee index funds or ETFs, offers broad diversification and a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   **Fixed Income/Bonds**: To reduce risk, consider complementing stocks with fixed income or bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A mix of Canadian stocks and bonds can provide steady growth and protection from market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   **Real Estate**: [[role_of_real_estate_in_canadian_household_net_worth | Real estate]] is a significant wealth builder for Canadians and is often part of millionaires' portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Rental properties can provide steady income and property value appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Utilize accounts like RRSPs, TFSAs, and FHSAs for tax benefits that enhance investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. RRSP contributions are tax-deductible and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal, while TFSA investments grow tax-free and withdrawals are also tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### 4. Frugality and Saving
Living frugally and consistently saving a significant portion of income can lead to substantial wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

*   **Example**: Ronald Reed, a janitor and gas station attendant, built an $8 million fortune by living frugally and consistently [[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | investing]] in blue-chip stocks like Proctor and Gamble, JP Morgan Chase, and General Electric over several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:09:12]</a>. His strategy demonstrated the power of long-term [[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | investing]] and living below one's means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   This approach shows that a large fortune can be built even with a low income if consistent saving and wise [[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | investing]] principles are followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   However, it's important to avoid "extreme frugality" that negatively impacts quality of life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

By finding the best approach that suits individual lifestyles and needs, Canadians can work towards achieving a [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] that places them among the wealthiest 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

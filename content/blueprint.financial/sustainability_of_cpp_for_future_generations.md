Many Canadians express concern about the future of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), with 64% believing it won't be available when they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Worries are fueled by an aging population, rising costs, and discussions like Alberta potentially leaving the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the CPP is more secure than commonly thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article explores why the fund is unlikely to run out.

## [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | CPP Outperformance and Growth]]

The CPP has consistently [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | outperformed expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion, achieving an 8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This pushed the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

This asset total significantly surpasses initial projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. In the year 2000, the CPP was projected to reach $425 billion by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Instead, it hit $632 billion in 2023, exceeding projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

This outperformance is a direct result of [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | smart investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The fund managers are making sound long-term decisions, enabling the fund to grow faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The CPP fund has remained resilient and continued to grow even during challenging economic periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This robust growth ensures the CPP can easily handle the increasing number of retirees today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | Sustainability for Generations]]

The long-term [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | sustainability]] of the CPP for future generations is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The Chief Actuary of Canada conducts a detailed review of the CPP's [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | financial health]] every three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The latest report confirms the CPP is on solid ground for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The fund, currently at $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, is projected to grow substantially:
*   **By 2030:** Expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **By 2040:** Projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **By 2050:** Expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

These forecasts highlight the long-term [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | potential sustainability]] of the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The projected growth ensures the fund is well-positioned to support both current retirees and future generations of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The CPP is likely to remain financially stable for at least 75 years, suggesting solvency well into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting

Concerns about the accuracy of CPP reports are natural, especially considering past financial scandals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. However, the CPP has several safeguards to ensure trustworthiness:
*   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** This independent body handles audits, providing impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | financial health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The Chief Actuary operates free from political influence, ensuring accurate reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The 31st Actuarial Report (2022) confirmed the CPP's [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | sustainability]] for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** The PBO reviews the Chief Actuary's reports, adding another layer of independent scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Known for its independence, transparency, and nonpartisanship, the PBO provides reliable oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Its role is to deliver objective, factual analysis and ensure financial data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** Further assurance comes from external audits. Deloitte's 2022 audit, for example, confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

With multiple layers of independent oversight, external audits, and transparency, the CPP is considered one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | Investment Performance and Management]]

The [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | performance and management]] of CPP Investments are crucial to its long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Strong Long-Term Returns
CPP Investments has delivered a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This performance has propelled the fund's assets to $632 billion, exceeding projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The fund's ability to outperform expectations over the long term demonstrates the success of its [[investment_strategies and_management_of_cpp | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Diversified Global Portfolio
The fund maintains a globally diversified portfolio across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. It invests in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the rest spread across international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This diversification helps reduce "home risk" by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Active Management Strategy
CPP Investments employs an active management approach to achieve returns, particularly in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This strategy aims to outperform passive approaches over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, though it may underperform in certain years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For example, while the CPP's 8% net return for fiscal 2024 was strong, it fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Despite short-term fluctuations, active management is essential for a pension fund like the CPP to address the complexities of pension payouts and [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | actuarial needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The significant growth of CPP assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates sound [[cpp_management_and_sustainability | investment management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

In conclusion, the CPP's robust [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | performance and growth]], long-term [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | sustainability projections]], and transparent oversight by independent bodies provide strong assurance for its future. Canadians can have peace of mind knowing their retirement benefits are likely to be there when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Understanding the difference between median and average Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balances provides a more realistic view of Canadians' retirement savings. While averages can be skewed by high-income earners, median data offers a more accurate snapshot for most individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Average RRSP Balance Trends

The [[average_rrsp_balance_in_canada | average RRSP balance in Canada]] experienced a significant decline between 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The national average dropped by 28% from approximately $144,000 in 2022 to $113,000 in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This reduction brings balances closer to historical averages, suggesting that the elevated levels seen in 2021 and 2022 were temporary spikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. These spikes were likely driven by pandemic-related savings habits, where individuals cut expenses and contributed more to their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The 2023 decline reflects a return to more typical savings levels after this pandemic-induced boost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Median vs. Average: A Clearer Picture

Median data is generally a better indicator than averages because averages can be heavily skewed by a small number of very high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For RRSP data, especially when looking at holdings by age, the median provides a more realistic representation of what most Canadians have saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This concept is similar to how [[comparison_of_median_and_average_incomes | median and average incomes]] can differ significantly.

For this analysis, median data for RRSPS, RIFs (Registered Income Funds), and LRAs (Locked-in Retirement Accounts) from Statistics Canada's latest available information (2019) was combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### RRSP Holdings by Age (2019 Median Data)

There is a significant difference between median and average RRSP holdings across various age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:

*   **Age 65 and Older**: The median balance is $100,000, while the average is $224,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This stark contrast indicates that average numbers are heavily skewed by high-income outlier earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Under 35**: Younger Canadians have a median of just $12,500 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This highlights the importance for young adults to start saving consistently as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **35 to 54 (Midlife Savings Growth)**: Savings improve in this age range, but the median of $30,000 to $70,000 is still considered far below what is typically needed for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Many in this group are juggling mortgages, family expenses, and careers, which can make prioritizing retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **55 to 64 (Nearing Retirement)**: The median savings for this group grow to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. While the average for some individuals is over $216,000, many will still need to rely on additional income sources to sustain retirement comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **65+ (Retirees Still Dependent on Government Benefits)**: The median savings remain at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, meaning many retirees will heavily depend on sources like CPP (Canada Pension Plan), OAS (Old Age Security), or other income streams, as private savings often won't cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Impact of Household Size on Contributions

[[household_size_and_its_impact_on_rrsp_contributions | Larger households tend to contribute more to their RRSPs]], likely due to higher combined incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. For example, two-person households had a median contribution of $4,888, while single-person households contributed significantly less, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This suggests that dual-income households are generally better positioned to prioritize and increase their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Economic Challenges Impacting RRSP Savings

Economic challenges, such as inflation and rising interest rates, significantly impact Canadians' ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In 2023, 74% of Canadians were concerned about the effect of inflation and rising prices on their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. By 2024, 63% still reported that current economic conditions negatively affected their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Despite these challenges, Canadians continue to focus on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

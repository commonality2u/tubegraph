The moment a Canadian household reaches a net worth of $100,000 marks a significant [[importance_of_reaching_the_first_100000_net_worth_milestone | milestone]] where wealth growth appears to "explode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>. This acceleration is evident in financial data:
*   Canadian households typically achieve $100,000 net worth between the ages of 28 to 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">00:00:07</a>.
*   After reaching this initial $100,000, net worth grows rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">00:00:16</a>.
*   Between ages 35 and 44, the average net worth jumps to nearly $660,000, over six times the initial $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">00:02:03</a>.
*   This momentum continues into the 40s and early 50s, with average net worth rising to $1.34 million for Canadians aged 45 to 54, which is over 13 times the initial amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>.

As Charlie Munger famously advised, "I don't care what you have to do, just get to $100,000. After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">00:00:50</a>.

## Why Net Worth Accelerates After $100,000

There are three primary reasons for this rapid wealth growth after reaching the $100,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">00:01:01</a>:

### 1. Investing and Compounding Returns
Once the $100,000 mark is hit, building wealth becomes significantly easier due to the power of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">00:01:09</a>.

#### The Power of Compounding Illustrated
Consider an example of investing $10,000 per year with a 10% annual return in tax-free accounts like a TFSA or RRSP, aiming for $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">00:01:20</a>.

| Milestone Achieved | Time Taken to Reach (Years) |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------- |
| 0 to $100,000      | 7.27                        |
| $100,000 to $200,000 | 4.25                        |
| $200,000 to $300,000 | 3                           |
| $300,000 to $400,000 | 2.34                        |
| $400,000 to $500,000 | Less than 2                 |
| $500,000 to $600,000 | 1.62                        |
| $600,000 to $700,000 | 1.4                         |
| $700,000 to $800,000 | 1.24                        |
| $800,000 to $900,000 | 1.11                        |
| $900,000 to $1,000,000 | 1                           |

This demonstrates that while the initial $100,000 takes the longest to achieve (7.27 years), largely driven by disciplined contributions, subsequent $100,000 increments require progressively less time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">00:01:37</a>. The last $100,000, from $900,000 to $1 million, takes just one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a>. The total time to reach $1 million using this strategy is approximately 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">00:02:49</a>.

#### Shifting Balance: Contributions vs. Investment Returns
As wealth accumulates, the proportion of growth from personal contributions versus investment returns shifts dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">00:02:55</a>:
*   For the first $100,000, approximately 73% comes from personal contributions, with only 27% from investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">00:03:02</a>.
*   By the $1 million mark, this is completely flipped: 75% of the wealth is generated by returns, and only 25% comes from direct contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">00:03:11</a>.
*   A key tipping point occurs around $300,000, where returns begin to outpace contributions, signaling that compounding is significantly accelerating wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">00:03:21</a>.

This process is likened to a rocket launch: the most effort is required to break free from financial gravity (reaching the first $100,000), but once achieved, the journey becomes faster and easier as investments do the heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">00:03:42</a>.

### 2. Income Growth
As individuals progress in their careers, their income typically increases, creating more opportunities to save and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">00:03:34</a>. This [[income_growth_and_its_impact_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | income growth]] plays a huge role in building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">00:04:22</a>. Higher earners not only have more income but also accumulate wealth at a much quicker pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">00:05:25</a>.

### 3. High Savings Rate
Saving a greater percentage of earned income is crucial for [[financial_strategies_for_wealth_building | wealth building]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">00:07:22</a>. A higher savings rate allows for more capital to be invested, thereby accelerating compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">00:07:44</a>. Avoiding lifestyle inflation and consistently directing extra income to savings are vital practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">00:08:05</a>. The sooner one starts saving, the more time compounding has to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">00:08:15</a>.

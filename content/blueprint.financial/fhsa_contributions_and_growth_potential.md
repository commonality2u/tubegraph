The [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is a tool designed to help first-time home buyers save for a down payment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. By [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | combining the FHSA and RRSP]]'s Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), it is possible to save a significant amount, potentially $200,000, tax-free, towards a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## FHSA Contribution Rules

The [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] allows individuals to contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. There is a lifetime maximum contribution limit of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

A key [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | benefit]] of [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] contributions is that they are tax-deductible, similar to an [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This provides a tax break each year contributions are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Saving with a Partner
When buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, individuals can double their [[financial_benefits_and_flexibility_of_fhsa | FHSA]] savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Combined, two individuals can reach a total of $80,000 in tax-free savings through their [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

> [!TIP] Spousal Contributions
> If a higher-income spouse contributes to your [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]], the contribution is treated as if you, the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] holder, made it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means the [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax benefits]], including deductions and tax-free growth, apply to the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] holder, not the contributing person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The person contributing has no tax obligation, and qualifying withdrawals for a home purchase remain tax-free for the holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This mechanism supports [[fhsa_and_its_role_in_income_splitting | income splitting]] in practice.

## Tax-Free Withdrawals
The primary [[financial_benefits_and_flexibility_of_fhsa | benefit]] of the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] is that withdrawals made for a home purchase are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This ensures every dollar saved goes directly towards the home, without repayment obligations like the [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]]'s Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | Growth Potential]] of the FHSA

The [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] offers significant [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | growth potential]] over time, contributing to substantial wealth for a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

*   **Example**: If an individual contributes the maximum of $8,000 per year for 5 years, reaching the $40,000 lifetime contribution limit, and assuming a 6% annual return, the account would grow to approximately $45,000 by the end of those 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   If that $45,000 is left in the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] for an additional 10 years at the same 6% rate of return, it would grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling the original contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This growth is entirely tax-free as long as it's used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Maximizing Savings with FHSA and RRSP
For couples, [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | combining]] the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] with the [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]]'s Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) can significantly boost down payment savings:

*   **Ross and Rachel Example**:
    *   They each contribute the maximum $8,000 per year to their [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSAs]] for 5 years, accumulating $80,000 between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   With a 6% return over the next 10 years, their combined [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] balance could grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   Additionally, they each have $60,000 in their [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSPs]] that they can withdraw tax-free through the HBP, totaling $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   By [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | combining]] the $160,000 from their [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSAs]] and $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals, Ross and Rachel could have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Even without a partner, an individual can use this strategy to save up to $100,000 towards a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Impact on the Canadian Housing Market
In Canada's high-priced housing market, especially in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver, saving enough for a down payment is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Combining the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] and [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] can make a substantial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

A $200,000 down payment, achievable by [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | combining these accounts]], can cover about 32% of the total cost in more affordable cities like Montreal and Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In higher-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the same $200,000 might cover only 16% to 19%, but it remains crucial for offsetting larger mortgage burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Tax Advantages
The [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | tax advantages of accounts]] like the [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA]] and [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] are critical when saving for a large down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   Without tax benefits, an individual with a 30% tax rate would need to earn over $285,000 to save $200,000 after taxes, meaning an additional $85,000 would be required to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   By using [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | FHSA and RRSP]] accounts, contributions are tax-deductible, eliminating taxes on that income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This allows individuals to save the full $200,000 without paying any taxes on it, drastically reducing the overall amount needed to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

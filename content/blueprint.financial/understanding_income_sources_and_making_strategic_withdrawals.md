Understanding your income sources and planning strategic withdrawals are crucial steps before retiring in Canada, as exemplified by Pam and Jim Helper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This proactive approach helps ensure a steady income stream throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Current Income Levels (Pre-Retirement)

For Pam and Jim, assessing their current financial situation was a revealing first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Their projected income levels leading up to retirement were impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>:
*   In 2024, their combined total employment income was $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   Additional income sources brought their total to $190,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Their income continued to remain strong until retirement, enabling comfortable saving and preparation for long-term financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Strategic Withdrawals from Savings Accounts

Jim and Pam plan to make strategic withdrawals from their registered accounts to maximize their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>:
*   When Jim turned 65 in 2042, they planned to start withdrawing from their Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   When he turned 71, they planned to start withdrawing from their Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   This gradual withdrawal strategy helps ensure a steady income stream for years to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Government Benefits: CPP and OAS

Jim and Pam also factored in government benefits:
*   They planned to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   They expected to receive almost $30,000 combined from both sources in 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   While their current strategy was to start at 65, they could reassess closer to retirement based on their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Options for CPP and OAS
It is possible to delay both CPP and OAS to age 70 for larger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Alternatively, benefits can start as early as age 60, with a reduction of up to 36% for CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Deciding when to take CPP and OAS is key to [[strategies_for_maximizing_retirement_income | maximizing retirement income]] and should align with broader financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

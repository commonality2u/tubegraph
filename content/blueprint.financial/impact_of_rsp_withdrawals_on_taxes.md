Many Canadian retirees may be leaving money on the table by not properly managing their [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. By using a specific [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RSP to TFSA tactic]], it's possible to reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and enjoy a more comfortable retirement by keeping more of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue for retirees is unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   Only 1.54 million out of 17.77 million Canadians who hold a TFSA manage to max out their contributions, which is just 8.66% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Many retirees enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For instance, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60-64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases as retirees age, with 18.71% of those aged 75-79 maxing out their TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This percentage slightly drops to 14% for those aged 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

While RSPs are effective for saving during working years, they come with certain obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Every dollar withdrawn from an RSP is taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Upon reaching age 71, the CRA mandates that RSPs be converted into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), requiring mandatory withdrawals whether the funds are needed or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

If you don't need the money from mandatory RSP/RRIF withdrawals, contribute any excess funds into your TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This strategy can lead to significant long-term savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   The CRA requires Eddie to withdraw $30,000 per year, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Eddie only needs $11,000 for his living expenses (covered by CPP, OAS, and pension) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Instead of putting this excess into a normal savings account or taxable non-registered investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

#### TFSA Growth Comparison

Assuming an average 6% annual return:
*   **TFSA Scenario:** After 10 years, Eddie contributes $100,000 to his TFSA, which grows to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account Scenario:** If Eddie invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, with 30% of gains lost to taxes each year (effective tax rate of 4% on gains), his account would grow to approximately $120,000 after 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Taxable Savings Account Scenario:** If put into a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the growth would be significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

#### Key Takeaways
*   By contributing excess income to his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   His TFSA balance grows to $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, or closer to $55,000 in a typical savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   This approach maximizes retirement savings and provides flexibility for future needs or continued tax-free compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Pro Tips
*   Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   Avoid making large [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RSP withdrawals]] in years where you already anticipate high income, such as from the sale of a property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Does This Eliminate RSP Taxes on Withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals will still be considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as [[withholding_tax_surprises_on_rrsp_withdrawals | OAS clawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The key is to minimize tax impact while maximizing overall retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

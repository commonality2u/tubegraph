Many investors initially choose mutual funds believing them to be a smart, safe investment option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, these funds can silently diminish wealth without investors realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The mutual fund industry often employs [[deceptive_marketing_tactics_in_the_mutual_fund_industry | marketing tricks]], including convoluted fees, complicated reporting, and excessive jargon, to keep investors confused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Five Key Signs Your Mutual Fund is Holding You Back

### 1. Underperformance Compared to Benchmarks
While an investment growing might seem positive, it's crucial to compare its returns against relevant benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If your fund consistently makes less than the overall market, you are losing out on potential wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For example, earning 10% when the benchmark returns 20% means you're effectively missing out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Benchmarking is essential; every mutual fund should be compared against an appropriate index like the S&P TSX Composite Index for Canadian equities or the S&P 500 for US large-cap equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Morningstar is a useful tool to evaluate a mutual fund's historical returns, quartile rankings, and comparisons to its category and benchmark index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

> [!example] Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A Example
> The Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A, despite having $4 billion in assets under management, has [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformed its benchmark]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Its growth of $10,000 to $16,458 trails the index growth of $18,814 and its category growth of $17,079 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
>
> In 2024, it ranked in the fourth quartile (bottom 25%) of its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Over three, five, and ten-year periods, it remained in the third quartile, indicating consistent underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
>
> Over a decade, this fund has trailed its index by 1.41% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. For an investor with $100,000, this means missing out on potentially tens of thousands of dollars in gains while paying higher fees for subpar results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Focusing only on positive returns is a common mistake; if your fund grew by 3% when the market grew by 10%, you effectively lost 7% in missed gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The SPIVA Canada midyear 2024 report confirms that most actively managed funds in Canada [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform their benchmarks]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The longer an underperforming fund is held, the wider the performance gap becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Over 10 years, a staggering 93.4% of Canadian equity funds underperform their benchmarks, meaning only 6% beat the benchmark over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### 2. High Fees That Eat Away at Your Returns
Banks earn billions from mutual fund fees, which many investors underestimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Even with good performance, [[high_fees_associated_with_mutual_funds | excessive fees]] can significantly erode long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

> [!example] The Hidden Cost of a 2% Fee
> A seemingly small 2% annual fee can reduce your final investment value by over 50% over 30 years, potentially costing hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. For an initial investment of $100,000 earning a 7% annual return, after 30 years:
> *   **No fees**: grows to $761,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
> *   **With 2% fee**: grows to only $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
> This represents a difference of nearly $330,000 lost to fees, meaning 2% in fees wiped out 43% of potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

#### Mutual Fund Fees That Destroy Wealth
*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: For equity funds, anything over 1.6% is considered high, and for bond funds, over 0.75% is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In contrast, most index ETFs charge only 0.05% to 0.25%, making mutual fund fees up to 30 times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. [[High fees associated with Canadian mutual funds]] are a significant concern.
*   **Hidden Trailer Fees**: Many mutual funds pay commissions (often 1%) to advisors, incentivizing them to sell high-fee funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **High Trading Fees/Turnover Ratio**: Frequent buying and selling by some mutual funds incur high trading costs, which can be passed on to the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

#### Red Flags in Fees
*   **Advisor Unwillingness to Explain Fees**: If your advisor avoids clear explanations or makes fees confusing, they likely benefit from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **High Redemption Fees**: Some funds penalize investors for switching out to another investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Segregated Funds**: Sold by insurance companies, these funds resemble mutual funds but carry extremely high fees (often 3-4%) and unnecessary insurance features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Signs of a segregated fund include being held with an insurance company (e.g., Sunlife, Manulife), terms like "segregated" or "guaranteed benefits," fees exceeding 3%, or a maturity period (e.g., 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### 3. Excessive Risk Leading to Stress and Anxiety
Investing should bring wealth and peace of mind, not stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If market drops cause sleep loss, constant portfolio checking, or panic about your financial future, your mutual fund might be too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. [[Risks and stress linked to mutual fund investments]] can significantly impact your "mental wealth."

#### Signs of Excessive Risk
*   **Stress During Market Declines**: Worrying, impulsively selling, or losing confidence during stock market dips indicates a portfolio misaligned with your risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Emotional Reactions to Market News**: Too much risk can lead to panic selling, locking in losses and preventing recovery benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding of Fund Holdings**: Some mutual funds hold volatile assets or employ complex, non-transparent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Not knowing your investment's risk level can lead to unpleasant surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Mismatch Between Investment Timeline and Fund's Risk**: Holding high-risk equity funds when you need access to your money in a few years can lead to large short-term losses that derail financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

#### Fixing Excessive Risk
*   **Recalibrate Risk Exposure**: A balanced portfolio should align with your financial goals, time horizon, and ability to handle volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Take an Investor Questionnaire**: Tools from firms like Vanguard can help assess risk tolerance and adjust portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Consider More Stable Investments**: If a mutual fund is too aggressive, switching to a diversified ETF portfolio or a lower volatility fund can provide peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### 4. Closet Indexing
Closet indexing is a significant issue in the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. It occurs when a fund is marketed as actively managed but closely tracks an index, all while charging the high fees of an actively managed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Investors pay for expert decision-making but receive expensive index-like returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

> [!example] TD Canadian Equity Fund Example
> The TD Canadian Equity Fund, a $7.4 billion fund marketed as actively managed, is a classic closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX Composite Index, while charging a high MER of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
>
> *   **Underperformance**: Over 10 years, it returned 6.87% annually, while the index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
> *   **Excessive Fees**: Its 2.19% MER significantly eats into returns compared to a low-cost Canadian index ETF like XIC (0.06%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
> *   **Low Active Share**: A low turnover rate of 12% indicates the fund isn't making bold investment decisions, yet it charges high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
>
> Over 10 years, this fund trailed the index by 1.72% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. A $100,000 investment would have missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains while paying steep fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Canada has a poor track record with closet indexing; approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds are invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. A Morningstar study found many actively managed Canadian mutual funds have low active share scores, meaning they barely deviate from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

#### How to Identify Closet Indexers
*   **Compare Holdings to a Benchmark ETF**: If stock allocations look nearly identical, you're paying high fees for no added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Look at Long-Term Returns**: If a fund's performance moves in lockstep with an index but charges higher fees, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Check the Turnover Rate**: A low turnover rate (under 20%) suggests minimal active trading, despite high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Consider Tracking Error**: If a fund's returns closely match the index year-over-year, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### 5. Tax Inefficiencies That Cost You Thousands
Even well-performing mutual funds can silently drain returns through [[tax_inefficiency_of_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Many investors unknowingly pay more taxes due to avoidable tax consequences triggered by their mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

#### Hidden Tax Traps in Mutual Funds
*   **Distributions That Trigger Unnecessary Taxes**: Many mutual funds distribute capital gains, dividends, and interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Holding these in a taxable account can result in owing taxes even if no shares were sold, or even if the fund lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Holding High Dividend Funds in a Taxable Account**: Dividend-paying mutual funds can be tax-inefficient outside of a TFSA or RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While Canadian dividends receive a tax credit, US and international dividends are typically taxed at your full marginal rate, leading to unnecessary tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

#### How to Reduce Taxes on Your Investments
*   **Use the Right Accounts**: Keep dividend-heavy or income-generating funds in RRSPs or TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient ETFs or capital growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   **Consider Switching to ETFs**: Many mutual funds frequently distribute capital gains, whereas broad market ETFs tend to be more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Rebalance Wisely**: Selling funds can trigger capital gains tax, so be strategic about when and how portfolio changes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Psychological Traps Keeping Investors Stuck
Many investors remain in underperforming, high-fee mutual funds due to:
*   **Loyalty**: "I've been with this bank forever. They must be looking out for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   **Advisor Influence**: "My advisor says this fund is great, so it must be." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>
*   **Perceived Hassle of Switching**: "I don't want to switch; it's just too much hassle." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>

Your financial future and family's well-being should always take precedence over loyalty to a bank or advisor, or the minor inconvenience of switching funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Alternatives to Mutual Funds
If you hold high-fee, underperforming mutual funds, it's time to explore more transparent alternatives with potentially lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>:

*   **Switch from Series A to Series F Funds**: Series A funds, commonly sold by banks, include hidden advisor fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Series F funds are a lower-cost version of the same fund without embedded advisor commissions, typically accessible through discount brokerages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**: ETFs have much lower MERs, starting around 0.05% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They offer better tax efficiency and often outperform mutual funds due to their low-fee, long-term approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Low-Fee Mutual Funds**: A few actively managed funds exist with reasonable MERs, but they are rare in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **DIY Stock Investing**: For those willing to manage their own portfolio, direct investment in individual stocks and ETFs can be a much lower-cost alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors**: Automated investment platforms like Wealthsimple provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers**: For active management, professional portfolio managers offer customized strategies with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% (depending on portfolio size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This option often includes financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

Most mutual funds are not designed to make investors rich; they are built to make banks rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

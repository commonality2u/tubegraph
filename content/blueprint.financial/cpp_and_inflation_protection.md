A significant advantage of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is its built-in protection against [[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | inflation]], a feature that can enhance a retiree's financial security over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Why Inflation is a Concern for Retirees
[[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | Inflation]] in Canada has been notably high in recent years, impacting the cost of various goods and services, from groceries and restaurant meals to rent and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This rising cost of living can erode the purchasing power of fixed retirement incomes, making it challenging to cover expenses over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## How CPP is Indexed to Inflation
The CPP is designed to mitigate the impact of [[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | inflation]] by being indexed to the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This means that CPP payouts are adjusted annually to keep pace with increases in the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This adjustment mechanism ensures that the value of the CPP benefit is maintained, allowing retirees to better afford their needs despite rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying CPP in an Inflated Environment
Delaying the start of CPP payments can further maximize the benefit of this [[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | inflation]] indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The longer one delays starting CPP, the larger the initial indexed payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This strategy helps secure a higher [[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | inflation]]-adjusted CPP payment for the remainder of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## CPP as a Unique Investment
The CPP stands out among many retirement income sources because it is indexed to [[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Few other investments on the market offer this kind of built-in protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This makes the CPP a valuable and unique pension provided by the Canadian government, specifically designed to support retirees during periods of higher living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

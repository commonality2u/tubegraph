Deciding when to start receiving [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] is one of the most impactful retirement choices Canadians can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin their CPP payments at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 often proves optimal, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime [[benefits of delaying CPP payments|benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This decision is a complex puzzle, integrating factors like [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]], investment returns, and various income streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## CPP Basics: Impact of Start Age

Most Canadians claim [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at age 60, with over 70% starting their [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|benefits]] at either age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, options exist for any age between 61 and 64, and 66 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting at Age 60**: Choosing to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at age 60 reduces monthly payments by 0.6% for each month before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This results in a permanent 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. For example, if a person qualifies for $1,000 per month at age 65, they would receive only $640 per month at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70**: [[Advantages of delaying CPP benefits|Delaying to age 70]] boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This leads to a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Using the same example, $1,000 per month at age 65 would become $1,420 per month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Actuarial Report: Strategic Considerations

A 2020 Actuarial study provides insights into optimal [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] take-up decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 60

This option is generally best for those needing immediate income or facing health concerns that suggest a shorter [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Permanent Drawbacks**: It comes with a 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those living beyond 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **High Returns**: If personal investment funds can consistently achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at 60 allows for investment of payments, potentially leading to a better financial outcome, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations**: Starting at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 65

This default option offers a balance, providing steady payments without requiring savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's suitable for retirees with below-average to average [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]] and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

*   **Predictable Income**: Standard [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP benefits]] provide reliable, inflation-adjusted income without additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: This option may leave potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis**: Payments typically equalize with the age 70 option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those uncertain about longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to Age 70

[[Advantages of delaying CPP benefits|Delaying provides]] the highest guaranteed lifetime income, increasing payments by the maximum amount, which is also inflation-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is ideal for individuals with longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

*   **Longevity Protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to approximately 6% to 8% annually, often outperforming other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age**: For most, [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed those from earlier start options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|Impact of Life Expectancy]]

[[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|Life expectancy]] is a crucial factor in the [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   **Gender Differences**: Women tend to live longer than men; 82% of women are likely to live past age 80, making [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying CPP]] especially beneficial for securing inflation-protected income in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Healthy Lifestyle/Family History**: A healthy lifestyle or family history of longevity increases the odds of living longer (79% for men, 85% for women to live past 80), making [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delayed CPP]] a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **General Trend**: Even with lower longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80, meaning most retirees could [[benefits of delaying CPP payments|benefit]] from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Stats Canada Data on Life Expectancy

Data from Stats Canada indicates that the older an individual is, the longer their remaining [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]] becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live to about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|Life expectancy]] in Canada is generally longer than the conventional wisdom of 80-82, especially for those already middle-aged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Women's Advantage**: Women consistently live longer across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s, reinforcing the value of [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying CPP]] to age 70 for higher inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Men's Considerations**: Men with shorter [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancies]] should carefully balance longevity with their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Longevity Insurance**: [[Delaying CPP and OAS payments|Delaying CPP]] acts as a safety net, particularly for women who are more likely to face [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments|financial strain]] in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic Planning**: Integrating [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] timing with other strategies like RSP withdrawals and TFSA savings is key to optimizing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|Estimating Life Expectancy]]

Online calculators can provide estimates based on age, gender, lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
Two popular examples include:

*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits from regions known for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, asking detailed questions about health and habits for personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

While useful, these calculators may differ in their results and should be taken with a grain of salt, but they offer a more tailored outlook than general statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

To refine [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]] estimates, consider:

*   **Genetic Testing**: Uncovers potential health predispositions and longevity factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations**: Identifies modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing**: Measures aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings**: Regular checkups for chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) that impact longevity are crucial, especially starting in one's 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## CPP Present Value Calculator

While [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] break-even tables are a good starting point, a [[estimating_cpp_benefits|CPP present value calculator]] offers a more accurate estimate by incorporating factors like investment rate of return and the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

A common example is the Tax Tips CPP Retirement Pension Calculator. Users can input:

*   **Estimated monthly [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|benefit]] at age 65**: e.g., $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Estimated annual indexation of [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] (inflation rate)**: e.g., 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Desired start ages for evaluation**: e.g., 60, 65, and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Start year**: e.g., 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Estimated [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]]**: e.g., 86 (average for a woman in her 50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Expected rate of return on investments**: e.g., 2-6% (conservative range of 3-5% often recommended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Interpreting Calculator Results

The calculator outputs the present value of choosing [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] at different ages. For instance, with a 2% rate of return and [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|life expectancy]] of 86, the present value could be $222,000 at age 60, $286,000 at age 65, and $320,000 at age 70, indicating age 70 as the optimal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

However, adjusting variables significantly impacts the outcome:

*   **Rate of Return**: A higher rate of return (e.g., 4% to 6%) can narrow the gap between different start ages. At 6%, the choice between age 65 and 70 might be more even <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|Life Expectancy]]**:
    *   **Longer Life (e.g., to 100)**: Age 70 consistently becomes the best choice, providing significantly more value (e.g., over $130,000 more in present value compared to age 60, and cumulative payments over $1 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
    *   **Shorter Life (e.g., to 72)**: Starting at age 60 would be optimal, as [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying]] would result in receiving fewer payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Inflation Rate**: Fluctuations in the inflation rate (annual indexation of [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]]) can also greatly affect the optimal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## Comprehensive CPP Planning

Deciding when to start [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] is a complex puzzle where careful planning can prevent missing out on substantial retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Comprehensive approaches consider:

*   **Scenarios on [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions|Life Expectancy]] and Break-Even Points**: Analyzing how long one is likely to live and when [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying CPP]] becomes most beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   [[Tax implications of CPP|Tax Strategies]]: Evaluating how [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] income interacts with overall [[tax implications of CPP|tax situations]] to potentially reduce or increase one's [[tax implications of CPP|tax bill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining if [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying CPP]] can help avoid or reduce Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating [[Canada Pension Plan CPP benefits|CPP]] with Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) savings, and other retirement income sources for the most efficient plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

While there are exceptions, financial advisors often find that [[delaying CPP and OAS payments|delaying CPP]] into the late 60s or 70s offers significant [[benefits of delaying CPP payments|benefits]] for many clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

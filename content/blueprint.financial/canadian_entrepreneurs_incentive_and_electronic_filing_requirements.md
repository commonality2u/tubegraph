## [[canadian_entrepreneurs_incentive|Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI)]]

The [[canadian_entrepreneurs_incentive|Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive]] (CEI) offers tax relief for business owners by lowering the capital gains inclusion rate to one-third (33.33%) on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:08">[07:04:08]</a>. This incentive is being gradually introduced, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually until it reaches the full $2 million cap by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:58">[07:13:58]</a>.

For instance, a small business owner with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would include only $33,600 in taxable income under the CEI, whereas without it, $66,500 would be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:60">[07:22:60]</a>.

While the CEI reduces the inclusion rate, it does not affect investment income taxation, which continues to be subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:59">[07:37:59]</a>. For many business owners, the [[capital_gains_tax_updates_for_canadian_business_owners_in_2025|Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)]] often remains a more effective tool, as it provides a complete exemption for eligible capital gains, especially when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:40">[07:43:40]</a>. Strategically allocating gains across shareholders can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without solely depending on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:34">[07:58:34]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE is a nuanced area of tax planning that can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:95">[08:07:95]</a>.

## Electronic Filing Requirements

Starting in 2025, new Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules mandate that businesses filing six or more information returns (such as T4s or T5s) must do so electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:32">[08:16:32]</a>. Additionally, corporations with over $1 million in revenue are now required to submit their T2 returns online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:14">[08:27:14]</a>.

While established businesses that already file electronically may not be significantly impacted, smaller businesses or those still using manual methods will need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:57">[08:33:57]</a>.

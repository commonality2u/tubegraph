Increasing personal income plays a significant role in building wealth, as higher earners tend to accumulate wealth at a much quicker pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. In Canada, the wealth gap between different income levels is striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. For instance, in 2024, the average net worth of the lowest 20% income bracket was approximately $375,000, compared to almost $2.3 million for the top 20%â€”over 510% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. As individuals progress in their careers, their income is likely to increase, providing more opportunities to save and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Understanding these dynamics can help guide smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

## Key Strategies to Increase Income

### 1. Location Matters
Relocating to a province with higher wages can boost income and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. Alberta, for example, offers the highest average income in Canada at $61,500 per year, and its relatively lower living costs can enable greater savings and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

### 2. Invest in Education
Higher education significantly boosts earning potential in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

Investing in education, particularly in high-demand fields, can substantially increase income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### 3. Choose High-Income Careers

Increasing your income plays a crucial role in building wealth, as higher earners tend to accumulate wealth at a much quicker pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. As you progress in your career, your income will likely increase, opening up more opportunities to save and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Understanding income dynamics can guide smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. In Canada, the wealth gap between income levels is striking:

-   The top 20% income bracket has an average net worth of almost $2.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
-   The 21-40% income group averages about $500,000 in net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
-   The 41-60% bracket averages about $791,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
-   The 61-80% group finally breaks the million-dollar mark at close to $1.1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Key Strategies to Increase Income

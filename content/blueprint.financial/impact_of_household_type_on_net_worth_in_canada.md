When comparing the net worth of one-person and multi-person households in Canada, a clear wealth gap is apparent, though interesting trends have emerged from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Key Differences in Net Worth

By 2024, [[household_net_worth_in_canada | multi-person households]] had nearly double the net worth of one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Specifically:
*   **Multi-person households**: Averaged $1.17 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **One-person households**: Averaged $634,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This significant difference is primarily attributed to multi-person households possessing larger total assets, with $1.4 million compared to $74,000 for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This often makes sense due to the presence of two income providers and the ability to split expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Growth Trends (2020-2024)

Despite the wealth gap, one-person households have shown significant progress in closing the gap in terms of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **One-person households**: Their net worth increased by 40% from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Multi-person households**: Their net worth grew by 29.4% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

This faster growth rate for one-person households, despite starting with less, indicates notable progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Role of Real Estate

[[role_of_real_estate_in_canadian_household_net_worth | Real estate]] continues to play a major role in the net worth of both household types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:
*   For multi-person households, real estate makes up 55% of their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   For one-person households, it accounts for 45% of their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This suggests that multi-person households may be better positioned to afford property, while one-person households might face greater challenges in the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

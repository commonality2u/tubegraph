The First Home Savings Account (FHSA), also known as the first home savings account, is a new tool designed to assist first-time home buyers in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It allows individuals to accumulate significant funds for a down payment, potentially reaching a substantial amount when combined with other strategies like the [[retirement_savings_plan_and_home_buyers_plan_in_canada | Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)]] from a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Key Features and [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | Benefits]]

The FHSA offers several advantages for prospective homeowners:

*   **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to $8,000 per year to an FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. There is a lifetime maximum contribution limit of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Tax Deductibility**: [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | Contributions]] to an FHSA are tax deductible, similar to RRSP contributions, providing annual tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Growth and Withdrawals**: A key benefit of the FHSA is that any investment growth within the account is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When funds are withdrawn for a qualifying home purchase, no taxes are paid on the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This means every dollar saved goes directly towards your future home, without the repayment obligation associated with the [[retirement_savings_plan_and_home_buyers_plan_in_canada | RRSP Home Buyers' Plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### For Couples

If you are buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, you can significantly increase your savings. Each individual can contribute to their own FHSA, effectively doubling the potential savings to a combined $80,000 in tax-free funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Spousal Contributions**: If one partner earns more income and wishes to contribute to the other's FHSA, the contribution is treated as if the FHSA holder made it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This ensures the tax benefits, such as deductions and tax-free growth, apply to the FHSA holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The person making the contribution incurs no tax obligation, and qualifying withdrawals remain tax-free for the FHSA holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Combining FHSA with RRSP Home Buyers' Plan

The FHSA can be strategically combined with the [[retirement_savings_plan_and_home_buyers_plan_in_canada | RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)]] to maximize down payment savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The HBP allows individuals to withdraw up to $60,000 tax-free from their RRSP for a first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For couples, this doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, unlike the FHSA, the HBP withdrawal must be repaid to the RRSP over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Missing a repayment results in the amount being added to your taxable income for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Example: Ross and Rachel's Strategy

Consider Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>:

*   They max out their FHSAs, contributing $40,000 each, for a combined total of $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   They also utilize the HBP, withdrawing $60,000 each from their RRSPs, totaling $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   By combining these tools, Ross and Rachel amass $200,000 for their down payment, all of which is accessible tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Even without a partner, an individual can save up to $100,000 for a home using a combination of FHSA and HBP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Growth Potential of the FHSA

The FHSA offers significant long-term growth potential due to its tax-free nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

*   If you contribute the maximum $8,000 per year for 5 years, you reach the $40,000 lifetime contribution limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Assuming a 6% annual return, this $40,000 could grow to approximately $45,000 by the end of 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   If this $45,000 remains in the FHSA for an additional 10 years at the same 6% rate, it could grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling the original contribution amount, all completely tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

In the case of Ross and Rachel, if they each contribute the maximum to their FHSAs for 5 years ($80,000 combined) and let it grow for another 10 years at 6%, their combined FHSA balance could exceed $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When combined with $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals, they could have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Impact on Home Ownership in Canada

Given the high home prices in Canada, especially in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver, saving for a down payment is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The FHSA, along with the HBP, plays a crucial role in making home ownership more achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

A $200,000 down payment from combining FHSA and HBP can cover about 32% of the total cost in more affordable cities like Montreal and Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In higher-priced markets like Toronto and Vancouver, the same $200,000 covers only 16% to 19%, but still significantly helps in reducing the mortgage burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Tax Advantages of Using FHSA

The tax advantages of accounts like the FHSA and RRSP make a massive difference in the amount you actually need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   Without tax benefits, to save $200,000, an individual with a 30% tax rate would need to earn over $285,000 just to have $200,000 left after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This means saving an additional $85,000 to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   By using the FHSA and RRSP, contributions are tax deductible, meaning you don't pay taxes on that income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This allows you to save the full $200,000 without paying a penny in taxes on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Every dollar contributed directly goes towards the home purchase, drastically cutting down the overall savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The FHSA is a powerful tool that, especially when combined with the RRSP HBP, provides a clearer and faster path to home ownership in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

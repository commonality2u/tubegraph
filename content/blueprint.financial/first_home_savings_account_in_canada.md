The [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is highlighted as a significant new account in Canada for individuals saving for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Key Features and Deadlines

### Contribution Deadline
For existing FHSA account holders, the contribution deadline is December 31st of the current year to receive a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This differs from an [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | RRSP]], which has a 60-day extension into the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Many individuals may confuse these deadlines due to the FHSA being a new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Contribution Limit
You can contribute up to $8,000 annually to an FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Contributing by year-end allows you to claim a tax deduction for that year, leading to instant savings when filing taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Tax Deduction Exception
An exception to contributing by year-end is if you anticipate your income will be significantly higher in the following year (e.g., 2025 versus 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. In such cases, delaying the contribution until the next year might be beneficial if you expect to be in a much higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Tax Savings Example
If you earn $70,000 annually and contribute $8,000 to your FHSA before December 31st, your taxable income is reduced to $62,000, resulting in substantial tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Opening an FHSA

If you qualify for an FHSA but haven't opened one yet, it is a priority to do so before December 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Your contribution room only begins to accumulate once the account is open, ensuring you maximize your benefits in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Pro Tip
Even if you are uncertain about buying a house, opening an FHSA is still a smart financial move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. If unused, the account can eventually be converted into an [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_to_save_for_a_home | RRSP]], providing additional [[optimizing_tfsa_rrsp_and_fhsa_in_Canada | RRSP contribution room]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Word of Caution
Avoid withdrawing funds early from your FHSA unless you are purchasing a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Early withdrawals can result in penalties and the loss of tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17 for a two-parent, middle-income family, which is about $17,235 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:17">[01:44:17]</a>. For families earning over $135,000 annually, the average cost can be even higher, reaching $43,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:14">[02:02:14]</a>.

The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) can significantly offset these costs, potentially covering almost half of the total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)?

The CCB is a tax-free payment designed to assist families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>. It serves as a financial umbrella, shielding families from rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.

Key features of the CCB include:
*   **Indexed to Inflation**: The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs, meaning future payments will be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.
*   **Completely Tax-Free**: Every dollar received from the CCB is yours to keep, with no deductions or surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

There are no restrictions on how the CCB money can be spent; families can use it for any necessary expenses, such as food, housing, or education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## How Much Can You Receive?

If you qualify for the maximum CCB, you could receive a substantial amount:
*   **Children Under Six**: Up to $7,78 per year, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Children Aged Six to Seventeen**: An annual maximum of $6,570, adding up to $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.

Combined, this can total up to $125,500 per child over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

There is no limit to the number of children for whom you can receive the CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. For instance:
*   One child: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   Two children: Doubles to $251,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   Three children: Reaches $376,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   A family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

## [[eligibility_and_application_for_canada_child_benefit | Eligibility and Application for Canada Child Benefit]]

The CCB is calculated based on your **Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, AFNI is the combined income of both spouses minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. As your net income increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_income_on_canada_child_benefit | Impact of Income on Canada Child Benefit]]

The CCB amount decreases as your income rises. The reduction happens in two stages:
1.  **Income between $36,525 and $79,000**: Your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
2.  **Income above $79,000**: An additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over $79,000, after the initial reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

**Example: CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six**
| Family Net Income | Annual Benefit | Monthly Benefit |
| :---------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| $35,000 or less   | $7,777         | $649            |
| $50,000           | $6,884         | $570            |
| $100,000          | $2,776         | $231            |
| $130,000          | $1,814         | $151            |
_Note: As income increases, the annual and monthly benefit decreases, eventually phasing out completely at very high income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>._

For exact numbers, especially with multiple children, it is recommended to use the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)'s CCB calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Getting Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward. Once you file your taxes, the CRA automatically calculates your payments; no extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. As long as you and your partner file your taxes every year and your child is registered with the government, payments will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

Filing your taxes also unlocks other important [[key_canadian_tax_credits_and_benefits | benefits]] and credits, such as the GST/HST credit and the climate action incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

For faster payments, setting up direct deposit with the CRA ensures the money goes directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. CCB payments are typically issued between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Keep Information Updated
It is crucial to keep your information up to date with the CRA. If your family's income changes due to job loss, or life events such as marriage, birth of a new baby, or divorce, updating the CRA immediately could qualify you for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. Changes in shared custody arrangements should also be reported, as the CRA typically splits payments 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

## Why the CCB Was Introduced

The CCB is a vital tool for [[effect_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | reducing child poverty]] and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   **Poverty Reduction**: Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty, supporting 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Support for Families**: It aims to ease the financial burden of raising children, potentially encouraging families to grow and helping to tackle declining birth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

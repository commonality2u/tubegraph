When considering when to start receiving [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits]], it's important to understand how your decision can affect other government benefits like [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] and the [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]]. Delaying your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] can lead to higher monthly payments, which in turn can influence your eligibility or the amount received from these other programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Impact on Old Age Security (OAS)

[[Old Age Security (OAS)]] payments can be substantial in retirement, potentially reaching up to $784 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. However, unlike [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]], [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] is subject to a "clawback" if your income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### OAS Clawback Threshold
The [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] clawback begins if your annual income surpasses $90,995, based on the latest figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. If your total income, including your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] payments, pushes you above this threshold, the government will reduce or "claw back" a portion or even the entire amount of your [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### CPP and OAS Clawback Considerations
While delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] increases your monthly benefit, it also increases your taxable income. This higher [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] payment, combined with other sources of income, could potentially lead to the [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

>[!EXAMPLE] Simon's Income and OAS Clawback
>Simon has income from various sources:
> *   Employment pensions: $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
> *   RSPs: $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
> *   Investment income: $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
> *   Delayed [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] (starting at age 70): $21,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
>
>His total annual income after age 70 is $81,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Even with delayed and larger [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] payments, his income remains below the $90,995 threshold, meaning no [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] clawback applies, and he retains all his benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This demonstrates that if your overall income is expected to be well below the clawback limit, delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] can still be beneficial without impacting your [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Impact on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

The [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] is an additional benefit for low-income seniors who receive [[Old Age Security (OAS)]]. Your income level directly affects your eligibility for [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from sources like RSPs or work pensions, it is likely you won't qualify for the [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In such a scenario, delaying your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] payments to receive a larger monthly amount would not negatively impact your [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] eligibility, as you wouldn't have qualified regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding the interplay between [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]], [[Old Age Security (OAS)]], and [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] is crucial for [[strategies_for_maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | maximizing your retirement benefits]]. While delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] can significantly boost your monthly income, it's important to assess your overall financial situation to ensure it doesn't inadvertently lead to [[Old Age Security (OAS)]] clawbacks or affect [[Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] eligibility if those benefits are vital to your retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Personal financial circumstances are unique, and the best decision for when to take [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] depends on individual factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

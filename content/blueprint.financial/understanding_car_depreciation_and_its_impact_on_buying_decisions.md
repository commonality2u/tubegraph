The used car market experienced a staggering 40% surge during the pandemic, but with prices now stabilizing, many individuals are re-evaluating their next vehicle purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When deciding whether to buy, lease, or finance a vehicle, understanding car depreciation is a critical factor that can significantly influence your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## What is Car Depreciation?

Car depreciation can be visualized as an iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The "shining new car you're driving off the lot" represents just the tip of this iceberg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, "beneath the surface, hidden from view, is a massive chunk of value that's going to melt away in the first few years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This loss of value is a significant, often overlooked, cost of car ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Estimating Car Depreciation

Estimating your car's depreciation is crucial because it "really moves the needle of how you should make your decision on whether you should lease or buy your car" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Several methods exist to gauge how much your car will depreciate annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>:

### 1. Research Average Depreciation Rates

New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Following that, they generally depreciate by an additional 15% each year for the subsequent four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This method offers a straightforward estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### 2. Utilize Online Depreciation Estimators

Websites such as Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book provide free tools to estimate a car's depreciation based on its make, model, year, and mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. These calculators can provide a more tailored estimate than general averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### 3. Check Current Marketplaces (Recommended)

Hands-on research in current marketplaces is the most favored method to gauge a car's depreciation and market strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. By checking sites like AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji, you can find current listings for cars matching your desired make, model, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This provides "realtime insight into its current value and how much it has depreciated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, offering actual listed and sold prices rather than just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Impact of Depreciation on Buying vs. Leasing Decisions

The annual depreciation rate is considered the most critical and often the most unpredictable number in car financing calculations, as it significantly swings the decision between buying and leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

*   If your vehicle is expected to have a **high resale value** (meaning lower depreciation), buying or financing is generally the more cost-effective option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. For example, if annual depreciation is only 10%, the net cost of buying decreases greatly, making it much better than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Conversely, if the vehicle is predicted to have a **low resale value** (higher depreciation), leasing becomes more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. If annual depreciation is, for instance, 25%, the net cost of buying can become significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The actual market resale value at the end of a financing or lease term is difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It heavily depends on supply and demand at that specific time, which can fluctuate independently of a vehicle's reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For instance, those who leased a vehicle in 2017 missed out on profiting from the soaring used car prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, as owning would have allowed them to capitalize on that market shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

Since predicting the market is nearly impossible, [[nonfinancial_considerations_when_deciding_to_lease_or_buy_a_car | non-financial factors]] might sometimes outweigh the financial estimations in your [[comparing_leasing_vs_buying_a_car_pros_and_cons | buy or lease decision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## The Case for Buying Used Cars

While various [[options_for_acquiring_a_new_car_in_canada | options for acquiring a new car]] exist, buying a used car is frequently considered the smartest financial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and as much as 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

By purchasing cars that are typically three to five years old, you can avoid this initial, steep depreciation hit and get more value for your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Cars in this "sweet spot" are generally not old enough to have major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Additionally, used cars often come with lower insurance costs and less financial burden overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. With careful research, you can find a reliable, well-priced used car that meets your needs, often with comparable or even better features than a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

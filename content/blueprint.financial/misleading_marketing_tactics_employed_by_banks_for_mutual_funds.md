Financial institutions in Canada often employ "tricky marketing tactics" when promoting mutual funds, which can "cloud the truth" for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These tactics often create an illusion of consistent high performance that does not reflect the full reality of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

## Highlighting Success Stories
Banks and financial institutions frequently highlight only the success stories among mutual funds, showcasing only the top-performing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This selective reporting ignores the underperforming funds that were quietly closed or merged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

For instance, advertisements from banks typically feature impressive returns from "HP performers," conveniently omitting the many other funds that underperformed and were shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This tactic leads investors to believe in an overall high performance that doesn't reflect the full reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Many people actually invest in these underperforming funds and experience lower returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Survivorship Bias
A key concept to understanding how mutual funds can mislead investors is [[understanding_and_avoiding_segregated_fund_fees | survivorship bias]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This bias occurs when only the surviving funds are considered in performance reports, while poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This results in a misleadingly positive picture of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Statistics on Fund Disappearance
The numbers reveal the extent of this issue:
*   Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   On average across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Specifically, only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   For Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

This means banks and financial institutions leverage [[understanding_and_avoiding_segregated_fund_fees | survivorship bias]] to their advantage, showcasing only the top performers and creating an illusion of consistent high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Aggressive Distribution Channels
Mutual funds are widely popular in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024, significantly more than the $429 billion in ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This popularity is partly due to their aggressive distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

*   **Accessibility and Convenience** Mutual funds are incredibly easy to access and convenient for the average investor, offering a straightforward way to diversify without extensive market knowledge or large capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Bank Push** Banks and financial advisors often push mutual funds due to aggressive sales targets, leading many Canadians to invest in them over more cost-effective options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. As a high-profit product for banks, they are naturally promoted to customers opening accounts or seeking other services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Trust in Professional Management** Many investors are drawn to mutual funds because they are managed by professional portfolio managers, who are seen as experts capable of making informed investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Despite data showing otherwise, people often believe in the expertise of these managers, hoping for high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Financial advisors are adept at reinforcing this belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.
*   **Misleading Ratings** Marketing, such as Morningstar's five-star ratings, can mislead investors into believing they will achieve better performance with certain funds, even though many studies have shown these funds tend to [[underperformance_of_canadian_mutual_funds_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform]] in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

This marketing, combined with the trust and reputation of large financial institutions, persuades many investors to choose mutual funds over other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

Upon retirement, individuals may be eligible to collect Old Age Security (OAS) payments, which can reach up to $948 annually [00:00:10]. However, this amount can be reduced or entirely "clawed back" by the government if an individual's income exceeds a specific threshold [00:00:16]. This reduction is officially known as the recovery tax [00:00:25].

## Understanding the OAS Clawback
The OAS clawback activates when an individual's income surpasses a certain threshold [00:00:28]. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is $90,995 [00:00:30]. The clawback applies a 15% recovery tax on the amount of income exceeding this threshold [00:01:27].

If an individual's income reaches or exceeds $153,700 annually, their entire OAS benefit can be lost [00:00:56]. For those aged 75 and over, the full clawback threshold is an annual income of $9,481 [00:01:05].

> [!example] David's Scenario
> David, a 75-year-old OAS recipient in Canada, has an income of $160,000 in 2024 [00:01:13]. Since his income is well over the clawback threshold, he will lose all of his OAS benefits [00:01:19]. The 15% recovery tax on the amount over the $90,995 threshold totals $10,300, which exceeds his annual OAS benefit of $9,481 [00:01:27].

## Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the Clawback

Understanding how to manage your income can potentially save you over $9,000 a year in lost OAS benefits [00:01:46]. The following seven strategies, listed from easiest to hardest, can help reduce or avoid the OAS clawback:

### 1. Delay CPP Payments
Delaying [[Strategies to increase CPP benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] payments until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70, is a highly effective strategy to reduce the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] [00:02:00]. This approach not only increases your CPP payments by up to 42% but also lowers your taxable income between the ages of 65 and 70, when the OAS clawback typically begins [00:02:14].

For example, if you are eligible for $1,000 per month in CPP at age 65, delaying until age 70 would increase your monthly payments to $1,420, a 42% increase [00:02:27]. These higher payments are indexed to inflation, growing in value throughout your retirement [00:02:41].

> [!example] Peter Parker's CPP Delay
> Peter Parker, initially facing an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income from CPP and other retirement sources, can significantly reduce this [00:02:50]. By delaying his CPP, his taxable income is lowered, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $584 [00:03:04]. This represents a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback, while also securing higher CPP payments for life [00:03:17].

### 2. Delay OAS Payments
Another smart strategy is to delay your OAS payments up to age 70 [00:03:39]. This increases your monthly OAS payments by 36% [00:03:45]. This provides more income later in life while potentially reducing or eliminating the clawback during earlier retirement years when income might be higher [00:03:47].

For instance, if you receive $500 per month in OAS at age 65, delaying until age 70 would boost your monthly payments to $680, a 36% increase [00:03:59]. This can significantly enhance your retirement income, especially when combined with delayed CPP [00:04:10].

> [!example] Peter Parker's OAS Delay
> Peter, facing an $811 OAS clawback at age 65, can eliminate it entirely by delaying OAS until age 70 [00:04:17]. This strategy is particularly effective if he has a higher income between ages 65 and 70, as it avoids benefit reduction during those years [00:04:53]. Additionally, he receives a 36% higher monthly OAS payment after age 70 [00:05:01].
>
> While delaying CPP and OAS offers dual benefits—potential clawback avoidance and higher future payments—it's not always ideal [00:05:10]. Individuals with health issues or a shorter life expectancy might not benefit as much from delaying [00:05:22]. Personalized planning is crucial [00:05:46].

### 3. Use Your TFSA Wisely
A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is an excellent tool for avoiding the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] because withdrawals from a TFSA are completely tax-free [00:05:54]. This allows you to access funds for living expenses without increasing your taxable income, helping you remain below the OAS clawback threshold [00:06:00].

If you have $100,000 in a TFSA and withdraw $20,000 annually for expenses, this amount is not taxed and does not count as taxable income [00:06:12]. This is especially helpful if your taxable income is close to the 2024 OAS clawback threshold of $90,995 [00:06:24]. In contrast, withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) could push your income over the threshold, triggering the clawback [00:06:43]. The TFSA provides flexibility for tax-free income and OAS benefit protection [00:06:56].

> [!tip] RSP to TFSA Laddering
> Consider gradually withdrawing funds from your RSP and contributing them to your TFSA before age 71 [00:07:09]. This strategy keeps your taxable income lower in later retirement and allows for tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA, minimizing the OAS clawback effect [00:07:18].

### 4. Pension Income Splitting
Pension income splitting can significantly reduce taxable income and help avoid the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]], particularly for couples where one spouse earns substantially less [00:07:36]. This strategy permits transferring up to 50% of eligible pension income to the lower-income spouse, helping to keep the higher earner's taxable income below the OAS clawback threshold [00:07:47].

> [!example] Peter and Mary Jane's Pension Splitting
> If Peter earns $60,000 annually from his pension and his wife Mary Jane earns less, Peter can transfer $30,000 of his pension income to her [00:07:57]. This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000, placing him in a lower tax bracket and reducing the risk of the OAS clawback [00:08:12]. Mary Jane, being in a lower tax bracket, will be taxed on the transferred $30,000, resulting in a lower overall tax burden for the couple [00:08:24]. Crucially, by reducing Peter's income, they can keep it below the $90,997 OAS clawback threshold, preserving his full OAS benefits [00:08:34].

### 5. Manage RRIF Withdrawals
When an RSP converts to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) at age 71, minimum annual withdrawals become mandatory and are considered taxable income [00:09:07]. These withdrawals can potentially push your income over the OAS clawback threshold [00:09:16]. However, managing these withdrawals carefully can minimize their impact [00:09:22].

One strategy is to use the age of a younger spouse to reduce the required withdrawal rate [00:09:26]. Another involves prioritizing withdrawals from non-taxable accounts, such as a TFSA, first [00:09:31].

> [!example] Peter and Mary Jane's RRIF Management
> When Peter turns 71 and Mary Jane is 65, they can use Mary Jane's younger age to lower the required RRIF withdrawal rate [00:09:38]. Normally, Peter would need to withdraw 5.28% from his RRIF at age 71 [00:09:50]. By basing the withdrawal on Mary Jane's age, the rate drops to 4% [00:09:55]. For a $200,000 RRIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, reducing their taxable income by $2,560 [00:10:00]. This reduction helps them stay below the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] threshold and preserve more of their benefits [00:10:09]. More details on this strategy can be found in resources on [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burden_in_retirement | RSP withdrawal strategies]] [00:10:16].

### 6. Invest Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts
The type of income generated from non-registered accounts can significantly impact your taxable income and potentially trigger the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] [00:10:25].

*   **Interest income** from bonds, GICs, or savings accounts is fully taxable at your marginal rate [00:10:37].
*   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still contributes to taxable income [00:10:44].
*   **Capital gains** are only taxed at 50% of your marginal tax rate, if you can stay under the 250k threshold, making them a more tax-efficient option [00:10:48].

By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, you can reduce your taxable income and stay below the OAS clawback threshold [00:10:58]. For example, $10,000 in interest income is fully taxed, but $10,000 in capital gains only results in $5,000 being taxable [00:11:13]. Being mindful of how different investment incomes count towards your total income is crucial for avoiding the OAS clawback [00:11:38].

### 7. Capture Capital Gains Before Age 65
Timing is key when managing capital gains to avoid the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] [00:11:51]. Realizing gains before you turn 65 can prevent large taxable events once OAS payments begin [00:11:57]. While capital gains are taxed favorably (50% of the gain is taxable), large gains can still push your income over the clawback threshold in retirement [00:12:05].

A strategic approach is to realize these gains between ages 60 and 64, before you start receiving OAS [00:12:15]. This allows you to pay taxes earlier and avoid increasing your taxable income during the crucial years when OAS is active [00:12:23]. For instance, selling a property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain doesn't contribute to your taxable income when OAS begins, helping you stay under the clawback threshold and saving thousands in reduced benefits and taxes [00:12:31].

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning
Effective retirement planning requires understanding how strategies like delaying CPP and OAS, utilizing TFSAs, and managing RRIF withdrawals can help you avoid the OAS clawback and retain more of your benefits [00:12:52]. These strategic financial moves can potentially save individuals tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement [00:13:07]. While complex cases, such as those involving retirement properties or businesses, may require professional guidance, careful planning is essential for optimizing retirement finances [00:13:14].

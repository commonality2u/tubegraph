The tax deadline in Canada is April 30th, and failing to claim eligible credits can result in missing out on significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]] offers numerous tax credits, making it easy to overlook potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article outlines key tax credits, from common ones to "hidden gems," and provides strategies for stacking multiple credits to maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While the first credit on this list is automatically applied, most others require manual claiming on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Common Canadian Tax Credits

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)
The Basic Personal Amount (BPA) is a non-refundable tax credit allowing Canadians to earn a portion of their income tax-free before federal income tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the BPA is $15,129 for individuals with net incomes below the 29% tax bracket threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This credit is automatically applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the age amount tax credit, a non-refundable credit designed to reduce taxes in [[retirement_tax_credits_for_canadians | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, this credit is gradually reduced if your net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For example, a 66-year-old earning $42,000 would qualify for the full credit, while someone earning $46,000 would see the credit shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This tax break assists retirees in managing taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)
The Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA) provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim $8,081 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income, and eligibility criteria vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Additional amounts may be claimed for spouses or common-law partners in some cases, and retaining medical documentation is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | Medical Expenses Tax Credit]]
This credit helps Canadians offset out-of-pocket healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. You can claim eligible [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expenses]] that exceed 3% of your net income or $2,834, whichever is lower for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Eligible expenses include:
*   Prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Dental care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
*   Vision care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   Physiotherapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
*   Psychotherapy and other medical treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
*   Medical travel expenses if care is not available locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>

To maximize your claim, combine expenses for yourself, your spouse, and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Detailed records and receipts are essential for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Many Canadians overlook tracking these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Pension Income Amount
Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner, and pension income splitting allows couples to allocate eligible pension income for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Tuition Tax Credit

To claim, you must have paid at least $100 in tuition fees to a recognized educational institution in Canada or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Courses must be at a post-secondary level or aim to improve occupational skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. For students aged 16 and above, online courses may qualify if they meet full-time attendance requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If not needed immediately, the credit can be carried forward to a future tax year or transferred up to $5,000 to a parent, grandparent, spouse, or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Donation Tax Credit
Donating to registered charities can provide significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Up to 75% of your net income can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Unused donation credits can be carried forward for up to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In-kind donations, such as stocks or securities, may offer additional tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Canada Child Benefit (CCB)
The CCB provides tax-free monthly payments to help families with the cost of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. In 2025, parents can receive up to $7,997 per child under six and $6,744 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The benefit is income-tested, meaning payments phase out as family income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. No tax is paid on the amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

This applies to both Canada student loans and provincial student loans, but private loans do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. If you do not use the credit immediately, you can carry it forward for up to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Digital News Subscription Tax Credit
You can support Canadian journalism while saving on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. You can claim a non-refundable tax credit of 15% on up to $500 per year spent on eligible digital news subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

This credit reduces taxes by up to $3,000 (15% of $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> and can be combined with the [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expenses tax credit]] for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Stacking Multiple Credits for Bigger Refunds

Maximizing your savings involves stacking multiple tax credits and deductions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Savings Combo
For retirement tax savings, consider combining:
*   **Pension Income Amount:** Up to $2,000 per person of eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Credit:** For those 65 and over, worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

For example, if John has a large pension and Linda has a smaller income, both over 65, they can each claim the pension income amount. John also qualifies for the age amount credit, leading to lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Additionally, pension income splitting can further save money by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase refunds:
*   **Canada Child Benefits (CCB):** Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Claim daycare, babysitting, or after-school program costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount:** For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

For instance, Sarah and Mike, with two young kids (one with a disability) in daycare, can:
*   Receive CCB for child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Claim the child care expenses deduction to lower taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   Claim the Canada Caregiver Amount for their child with a disability, resulting in thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
Families can also split income by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

These are just some of the tax credits and strategies available to put money back in your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Optimizing your taxes and combining credits can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

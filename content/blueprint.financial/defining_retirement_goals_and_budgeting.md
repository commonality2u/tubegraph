Retirement is intended to be a period of enjoyment and freedom from stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To ensure a smooth transition, it's crucial to define your retirement goals and meticulously [[budgeting_for_retirement_in_canada | budget]] for your expenses beforehand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>.

## Defining Retirement Goals

The second crucial step before retirement is to define what your dream retirement looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:17">[01:49:17]</a>. For individuals like Pam and Jim, a comfortable lifestyle with plans for travel and family activities was a core goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:15">[01:54:15]</a>.

Key considerations when defining your goals include:
*   **Housing Decisions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>:
    *   **Staying in Your Home**: If you plan to remain in your current home, factor in maintenance costs, potential home modifications, and real estate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. This allows for more accurate [[budgeting_for_retirement_in_canada | budgeting]] for later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>.
    *   **Downsizing**: Moving to a smaller home can free up equity, reduce maintenance costs, and lower property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:04">[02:21:04]</a>.
    *   **Relocating**: If you intend to move closer to family or to a more affordable location, you should account for new living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>.

Factoring in housing costs is essential for creating a realistic [[budgeting_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:07">[02:45:07]</a>.

## Calculating Retirement Expenses

Once your goals are defined, the next vital step is to [[calculating_retirement_expenses | calculate your retirement expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Pam and Jim set their annual retirement spending at $90,000, which covered basic living costs and discretionary spending for travel and hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:09">[02:56:09]</a>. Planning for these expenses is crucial for a smooth retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:15">[03:04:15]</a>.

It is considered a wise move to overestimate your expenses to [[budgeting_for_retirement_in_canada | budget]] for more than you initially plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:14">[03:09:14]</a>. Their projected expenses began around $90,000 in 2024 and remained consistent in real dollars as they approached retirement, helping them maintain their desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>.

Consistently reviewing these expenses against inflation and potential unexpected costs ensures long-term financial preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

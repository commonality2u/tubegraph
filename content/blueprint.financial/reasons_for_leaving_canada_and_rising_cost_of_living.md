Many Canadians are considering leaving the country due to various challenges, including high taxes, inflation, and cold winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 2022, the number of Canadians moving to the U.S. alone reached 126,340 people, a significant 70% increase from the 75,752 people who moved in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is estimated that approximately 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad in 2016, and this number has likely grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Why People Want to Leave Canada

### Rising Cost of Living
The primary reason Canadians seek to leave the country is the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | rising cost of living]], particularly in cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | housing prices have skyrocketed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Moving to countries such as Mexico, Portugal, or even some parts of the United States can significantly reduce the cost of living, offering more affordable housing and cheaper groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These are often considered [[top_countries_for_canadians_to_live_affordably | top countries for Canadians to live affordably]] due to these factors.

### Harsh Winters
Canada's severe winters, with temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, prompt many to seek milder climates, trading snow shovels for beach towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Healthcare System Challenges
Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces significant challenges, including long wait times for medical services and a low doctor-to-population ratio, leading to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. According to the Commonwealth Fund, Canada ranks poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Adventure and New Experiences
Living abroad also presents opportunities for adventure, personal growth, and immersing oneself in new cultures, cuisines, and ways of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This aligns with broader [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | reasons Canadians retire abroad]].

## Steps for Making the Move

### Step 1: Make Sure You Want to Leave
Before making a permanent move, it's crucial to be absolutely certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A trial run, spending a few weeks or months living in the country (or countries) you're considering, can provide crucial hands-on experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This allows you to live like a local and discover if the lifestyle truly fits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. A trial run can prevent regrets by revealing potential issues such as safety concerns, cultural differences, or missing friends, family, and aspects of Canadian life like the healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Step 2: Figure Out How to Make Money Abroad
Unless you are financially independent, you will need a way to earn income while living overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Three common paths include:

1.  **Expat through a Company Transfer**
    *   **Process**: Seek international opportunities within your current company and express interest to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Job security, maintaining existing benefits, relocation assistance, and career boost through international experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Less flexibility over location, adapting to new work culture, and often requires a longer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

2.  **Remote Work**
    *   **Process**: Find jobs on websites like remote.co, weworkremotely, and flexjobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Set up a home office with reliable internet and manage time effectively with tools like Trello or Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Flexibility to work from anywhere with internet, saving time and money on commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Potential for isolation, requires high self-motivation and time management, and may offer less job security or benefits than full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Remote workers are often in software or IT, but can also be in HR, sales, or even law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

3.  **Digital Nomad**
    *   **Process**: Develop a portable skill or service (e.g., freelance writing, graphic design, programming, consulting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Build a portfolio and find clients on freelance websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Freedom to travel and experience new cultures, potentially more stable income from multiple clients, and fosters personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Unpredictable income, balancing work and travel, navigating visas and work permits, and potential fatigue from not having a home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Digital nomads engage in diverse professions, including digital marketing, startup ownership, content creation, and even therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Step 3: Understanding How to Become a Non-Resident of Canada
To become a non-resident of Canada, you must sever significant residential ties, such as selling your home, closing bank accounts, and relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The most significant factor is where you spend your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. You'll need to keep documentation of your new residency status, like rental agreements and utility bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   **Departure Tax**: This tax applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. You'll pay tax on the unrealized gains of investments and real estate, though RRSPs, RRIFs, and certain real estate are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. These deemed dispositions must be reported on your final tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **TFSA**: Your TFSA can remain open, but you cannot make contributions while a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Earnings within it remain tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **RRSP/RRIF**: You can keep these accounts, but withdrawals will be subject to a 25% withholding tax, which might be reduced by tax treaties with your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **CPP and OAS**: You can continue receiving CPP payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. For OAS, you are eligible to receive payments outside Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Step 4: Understanding Your New Country's Rules
While Canadian non-residency rules are clear, understanding the rules of your new country can be more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Key areas to research include:

*   **Residency and Tax Laws**: Research residency requirements, including temporary or permanent permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident and investigate tax treaties with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Visa Laws**: Familiarize yourself with different visa options, required documents, timelines, and conditions (e.g., work, study, length of stay), as well as renewal procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Learn how to open a local bank account, including choosing a reputable bank and preparing necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Understand local currency exchange rates and the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Other Important Regulations**:
    *   **Healthcare**: Understand the local healthcare system and if you need to purchase health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Driving**: Learn local driving laws and requirements, including international driving permits or converting your Canadian license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   **Legal Requirements**: Familiarize yourself with local laws and emergency services for safety and to avoid legal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Step 5: Explore Getting Citizenship Elsewhere
Securing citizenship in a new country offers benefits like stability, access to local services, and full integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Common pathways include:

*   **Citizenship by Naturalization**: Typically involves living and working in a country for a specific period (e.g., 5 years in Germany) while meeting language and integration requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Investment**: Countries grant citizenship in exchange for significant financial investments (e.g., purchasing real estate worth at least $400,000 in Turkey) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Relatives and Ancestry**: Eligibility for citizenship by descent if you have parents, grandparents, or sometimes great-grandparents from another country (e.g., Italian citizenship through Italian ancestry, Irish citizenship with an Irish grandparent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Other Ways**: Marrying a citizen of another country can often speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Some countries like the UAE grant citizenship for exceptional skills in fields such as science or culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Bonus Tip: Researching the Cost of Living with Numbeo
To quickly estimate the cost of living in a new country, you can use Numbeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. On their website, select the "cost of living comparison" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. You can compare your current city (e.g., Toronto) with a potential new city (e.g., Mexico City) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. The tool provides a breakdown of various costs; for instance, the cost of living in Mexico City might be 37% lower than in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. It can show specific cost differences, like eating out being almost 40% cheaper in Mexico City compared to Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. While the data is user-entered, it is generally accurate for popular cities and provides a good ballpark estimate for [[cost_of_living_comparison_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | cost of living comparison for Canadian retirees abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

*It is highly recommended to consult with a cross-border tax specialist if you are seriously considering moving countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.*

A common concern for individuals [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | planning their retirement]] is understanding what their monthly spending will look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down the [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average spending for Canadian retirees]], what they spend their money on, and how spending changes through different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This translates to approximately $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

The largest portions of expenditures for retirees in Canada are allocated to:

*   **Shelter**
    *   Includes the cost of main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
    *   Average annual spending: $13,814 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Average monthly spending: $1,151 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   Accounts for 22.3% of their monthly spending, or about a quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Even if a mortgage is paid off, retirees still incur significant costs for maintenance, property taxes, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**
    *   Average annual spending: $7,667 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Average monthly spending: $639 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   Accounts for 12.4% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   This includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Transportation**
    *   Represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**
    *   Accounts for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Even with free healthcare in Canada, a higher allocation is seen due to increased medical needs as people age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**
    *   Take up 5.4% of monthly spending, highlighting the need for continued [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | financial security in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**
    *   Includes expenses for maintaining the home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   Add up to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Spending Changes with Age

Household spending patterns evolve significantly as individuals progress through different phases of life, from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Data from Statistics Canada provides a clear picture of these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Middle-Aged Households (40-54)
This period sees the highest spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Average annual spending: $102,646 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Average monthly spending: $8,554 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Driven by higher family needs, such as larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there's a stronger focus on [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | saving and investing for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Pre-Retirement Households (55-64)
Spending begins to decrease during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   Average annual spending: $99,250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Average monthly spending: $8,271 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   Child care expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   There's also a greater focus on paying off mortgages and [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | preparing even more for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Retired Households (65+)
Spending further reduces once retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Average annual spending: $61,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   Average monthly spending: $5,154 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there's less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending generally occurs in three phases:
1.  **High Spending Phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
2.  **Medium Spending Phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
3.  **Low Spending Phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

### Example: Alex's Retirement Spending

Consider Alex, a Canadian retiree, and how his household expenses transition through these stages:

*   **Early Retirement (65-70 years)**
    *   Annual spending: ~$70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Monthly spending: ~$5,833 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   Housing costs are high, but reduced since the mortgage is paid off (though maintenance and property taxes remain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease due to no daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   Food spending is slightly less due to dining out less and preparing more meals at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Spending on hobbies and travel is enjoyed, taking advantage of new free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years)**
    *   Annual spending: ~$60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   Monthly spending: ~$5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs reduce further with less travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Food costs remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Spending on travel reduces slightly, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Later Retirement (75+ years)**
    *   Annual spending: ~$50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   Monthly spending: ~$4,167 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs are significantly lower due to rare travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Travel spending comes to a halt, with Alex focusing on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Summary of Spending Phases
> *   **Middle-Age:** Highest spending due to family needs, education, and saving for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
> *   **Pre-Retirement:** Spending decreases as child care costs drop, with a shift to healthcare and mortgage payoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
> *   **Retirement:** Spending reduces further, prioritizing essential living and healthcare, while transportation and luxury expenses decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
> *   **Within Retirement:** Three phases (high, medium, low spending) reflect decreasing activity and spending as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Real-Life Observations from Clients

Financial advisors often observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>:

*   **Average Range:** Retirees typically spend anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000 or $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **High-End Households:** These households usually spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Variability:** Spending can vary significantly; some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For instance, an annual spend of $100,000 in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This reduction can be attributed to several factors:
*   Lowering housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Transportation becoming less of a need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Overall lifestyle changes as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends is crucial for [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Anticipating changes in spending habits helps ensure sufficient savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Many Canadians hope that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, relying solely on these benefits can lead to a challenging financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down the maximum amounts you can expect to receive from CPP and OAS in various scenarios, and what living on these benefits truly entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The Canada Pension Plan is determined by your lifetime earnings and contributions during your working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. A higher contribution history typically results in a higher payout in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Most individuals do not receive the maximum CPP amount because it requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

The CPP is designed to replace approximately 25% to 33% of your working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For a deeper understanding of how to optimize your CPP benefits, refer to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | strategies to maximize CPP benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Maximum CPP Payouts in 2025 by Age
The age at which you begin collecting CPP significantly impacts your monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

*   **Starting at age 60**: The maximum monthly payment is approximately $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Starting at age 65**: The maximum monthly payment increases to $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Starting at age 70**: The maximum monthly payment can reach approximately $2,034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Delaying CPP until age 70 can boost your benefits by over 40% compared to starting early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a universal benefit available to Canadians aged 65 and older who have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not based on employment income and is available regardless of your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, overall income, and whether you choose to defer payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Maximum OAS Monthly Payments as of March 2025

*   **Ages 65 to 74**: The maximum monthly payment is $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Age 75 and older**: The maximum monthly payment increases by 10% to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

For seniors with very low total income, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a government benefit designed to provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Maximum GIS for 2024**: Single seniors with no other income can receive up to $900 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Impact of other income**: GIS is reduced dollar for dollar if you have any additional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Even small withdrawals from Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) can affect your eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Total Estimated Income from CPP, OAS, and GIS (without other income)

If you have no other income sources and qualify for GIS, your total retirement income might look something like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   **CPP**: Approximately $800 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   **OAS**: Approximately $700 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> (Note: OAS does not count toward GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>)
*   **GIS**: Approximately $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total estimated income**: About $2,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

This amount is barely above the poverty line, making it a challenging plan to live comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Scenarios for Living on CPP and OAS Alone

While possible, living on CPP and OAS alone requires significant sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### When it Could Work

It might be possible to live on CPP and OAS alone if:
*   **You own your home outright**: No mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners might also [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | borrow against their home]] or downsize to free up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **You live in a very low-cost area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **You share housing costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **You have extra support**: Help from family, additional investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant financial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

> For example, a mortgage-free retiree in small-town Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When it Falls Apart

For most retirees, relying solely on CPP and OAS is insufficient because of:
*   **Major city costs of living**: Rent in major cities like Toronto or Vancouver can easily exceed $2,000 per month for a one-bedroom, immediately wiping out most of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Unexpected expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **No savings**: Living month-to-month without emergency funds means every unexpected bill creates a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. You may have to rely on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Strategies to Supplement CPP and OAS Income

If CPP and OAS alone are not enough to cover your expenses, several strategies can help bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   **Delay CPP and OAS payments**: As discussed, delaying benefits until age 70 significantly increases monthly payouts. CPP can grow by 42% and OAS by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This is part of [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | the impact of delaying CPP and OAS on benefits]].
*   **Engage in part-time work**: Working longer or picking up part-time work can ensure your money lasts throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Lower housing costs**: Downsizing your home frees up capital, and relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or abroad can make your money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Utilize government benefits**: Explore programs like the Allowance for the Survivor, which provides additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Strategic financial planning**: Techniques like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower your tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Creative Approaches for Limited Income
Some retirees are finding innovative ways to make limited income work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>:

*   **House hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming house-sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Turning hobbies into income**: Monetizing skills by teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-stay arrangements**: Programs like TrustedHousesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic retirement**: Slow traveling through low-cost countries, taking advantage of extended tourist visas, and living for months at a time where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. For instance, a retiree in Mexico lived on around $1,500 a month, with $600 for rent and eating out daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Retirement planning is crucial. The earlier you diagnose potential financial shortfalls, the more options you have to address them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Canadians considering [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retiring abroad]] may be surprised by how their government income is affected when they leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Key benefits like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) behave differently when a recipient becomes a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is designed to support low-income seniors residing in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is explicitly not portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Loss of Benefits
If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. There is no social security agreement that protects GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, as it is strictly tied to physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study: Gan
> Gan, a 71-year-old retiree receiving CPP and GIS, moved to Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Her GIS was terminated a few months into her move because she was outside Canada for more than six months, automatically disqualifying her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Planning Implications
If GIS is a crucial part of your [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | retirement income]], it's essential to factor its loss into your planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. You may need to delay your move, adjust your [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | budget]], or seek other income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Residency Trick
Some retirees maintain part-year residency in Canada to retain their healthcare and [[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | tax]] status, known as the "snowbird" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They ensure they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is based on your contributions during your working life in Canada, not your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Portability
Your CPP benefits will continue to be paid regardless of where you live in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The amount received remains the same whether you are in Canada or another country like Portugal, Thailand, or Costa Rica <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. CPP survivor benefits and child benefits also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study: Linda
> Linda, who worked in Toronto for 35 years and contributed to CPP, plans to retire in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Her CPP payments will not change because they are based on her contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Tax Implications
Your CPP payments may be subject to withholding [[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax]] if you are considered a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

*   **Tax Treaties**: If Canada has a tax treaty with your new country of residence, the withholding tax could be reduced or eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. For example, the tax treaty with the US may allow you to avoid withholding tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **No Treaty**: Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Local Tax Laws**: Your new country of residence might also tax these payments differently, so it's advisable to check local tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements
Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These agreements help avoid double contributions, ensure uninterrupted CPP coverage, and coordinate benefits if you've worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Receiving Payments
CPP payments can be direct deposited into a Canadian bank account, received in local currency through a local bank in many countries, or mailed as a check in Canadian dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

Old Age Security (OAS) is based on residency, not your work history or contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Qualification Rules
To qualify for OAS while living outside of Canada, you must meet specific residency [[rules_and_considerations_for_retaining_canadian_benefits_while_living_abroad | rules and considerations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
*   You can receive OAS abroad if you've lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   If you've lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure, your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and re-establish residency to restart payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study: Pedro
> Pedro moved to Canada at age 25 and lived there for 30 years before retiring to Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Because he met the 20-year residency requirement, he continues to receive his full OAS payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Exceptions and Social Security Agreements
You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country with a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time lived in both countries totals at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, the years lived in another country do not increase your OAS amount; they only help determine eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Tax Implications
Your OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Withholding Tax**: OAS may be subject to a non-resident withholding [[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax]], with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaties**: This rate may be reduced or eliminated if you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. For example, the Canada-US tax treaty means OAS is not subject to withholding tax if you move to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, the Canada-Germany tax treaty, while in place, does not eliminate withholding tax on OAS; instead, Canada may tax public pensions at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Filing Requirements**: You will receive an NR4 tax slip each year instead of a T4 and must include it when filing your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. It is crucial to continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### OAS Recovery Tax (Clawback)
The OAS recovery tax, or clawback, begins at an income threshold ($93,454 in 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Strategies to manage taxable income include [[impact_on_rrsp_when_moving_abroad | RRSP withdrawals]], pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Planning Strategies

Understanding the [[impact_of_residency_on_canadian_government_pensions | impact of residency]] on these benefits is key to effective planning.

> [!example] Case Study: Anita
> Anita, age 67, retired to Portugal after living and working in Canada for 22 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. She qualified for CPP and OAS (having crossed the 20-year residency threshold) and was receiving GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Portugal has social security and tax treaties with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
>
> *   **CPP**: Continued without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. She paid a reduced 15% withholding tax due to the tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
> *   **OAS**: Continued because she met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Had she moved a year earlier, she would not have received OAS until returning to Canada or qualifying through a treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
> *   **GIS**: Stopped after 6 months, as GIS requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
>
> Anita's successful strategies included delaying her move until she reached 20 years of residency, choosing a treaty country like Portugal to reduce tax, and planning early to manage her [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | budget]] without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Summary: Your Travel Companions

Think of your Canadian retirement benefits like travel companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>:

*   **CPP** is your "ride or die" friend; it goes wherever you go, but watch out for potential [[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax]] at your destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **OAS** is "selective"; it will only come if you've built a strong relationship (20+ years of living in Canada after age 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, unless you have mutual friends in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **GIS** "just loves Canada"; it's generous while you're there, but will stop once you leave for more than 6 months, with no treaty or workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Additional Pro Tips
*   Consider drawing down your [[impact_on_rrsp_when_moving_abroad | RRSPs]] before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Plan for private health care, as provincial coverage ends after 6 to 7 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

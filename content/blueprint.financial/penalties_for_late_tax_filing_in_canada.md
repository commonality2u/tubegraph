Filing your taxes after the deadline can result in significant penalties from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). These penalties can apply even if you don't owe taxes, and they can increase with repeated late filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Penalties for Unpaid Taxes

If you owe taxes, the CRA imposes a penalty on the unpaid balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:
*   **Initial Penalty:** 5% of the unpaid balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Monthly Addition:** An additional 1% per month until the balance is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Impact on Refunds and Benefits

Even if you do not owe any taxes, filing late can delay important tax refunds and benefits, such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   GST/HST credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Canada Child Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>
*   Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

## Avoiding Late Filing Penalties

To avoid these [[consequences_of_tax_fraud_in_canada | costly mistakes]], consider the following [[tips_for_filing_income_taxes_in_canada | tips]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **Set Reminders:** Mark your calendar well before the April 30th deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **File on Time, Even if Unpaid:** If you anticipate owing taxes, file your return by the deadline even if you cannot pay the amount immediately. This prevents the late filing penalty, although interest may still apply to the unpaid balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Penalties for Unreported Income

A separate but related penalty can arise from forgetting to report all income. The CRA cross-references your tax return with income records like T4s and T5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now report income directly to the CRA, which can trigger automatic reassessments if earnings are not declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return and also missed reporting income in any of the previous three years, the CRA may impose a penalty of 10% of the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

To prevent this, always verify that all tax slips are included by checking your My CRA account before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Using Autofill My Return

The CRA offers a free tool called "Autofill My Return," integrated into NetFile-certified tax software (e.g., TurboTax, Wealthsimple Tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This tool automatically imports your T4s, T5s, RRSP contributions, and other tax slips directly from the CRA, helping to ensure all income is reported and deductions are claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Using this feature can help prevent common errors and potential audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

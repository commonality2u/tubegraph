For Canadian retirees, understanding and utilizing basic tax credits is a fundamental step in keeping more of their money in retirement for activities like travel, hobbies, and loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These straightforward credits can significantly reduce tax bills immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Key Basic Tax Credits

Three primary tax credits are particularly beneficial for retirees:

### 1. Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

The Basic Personal Amount allows every Canadian to earn a certain amount of income tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In 2024, this amount is $15,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This credit is applied automatically when filing taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

For instance, if a retiree like Marjorie earns $40,000 annually from her pensions, the first $15,000 of her income is tax-free due to the BPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. At a combined 20% federal and provincial tax bracket (common in Ontario for this income level), this credit alone saves her $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### 2. Age Amount Credit

Once an individual turns 65, they become eligible for the Age Amount Credit, which provides additional tax relief for seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This credit offers an additional $8,790 tax exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Similar to the BPA, this credit is automatically applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

However, the Age Amount Credit begins to phase out for higher-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In 2024, if a retiree's income exceeds $42,335, the credit starts to reduce, phasing out entirely at approximately $113,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For someone like Marjorie, whose income is $40,000, she qualifies for the full amount, saving her $1,758 at a 20% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### 3. Pension Income Amount Credit

This credit allows retirees to claim up to $2,000 of eligible pension income tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Eligible income includes amounts from a [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | RRIF]] or employer pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

A crucial point is that this pension credit does *not* apply to Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Retirees must apply it to other pension income sources, such as a [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | RRIF]] or a private pension plan, to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This credit adds $400 in [[tax_reduction_for_retirees | tax savings]] for Marjorie, who can claim it by reporting eligible pension income on line 31400 of her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Combined Tax Savings Example: Marjorie

By applying these three basic tax credits, Marjorie's combined tax savings total $5,158 annually, providing her with extra money to enjoy her retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

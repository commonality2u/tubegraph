Wealth Awesome.com was a website launched in 2019 with initial financial goals of earning $3,000 a month and attracting 30,000 monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These goals were eventually exceeded by almost tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The site's journey involved its inception, growth, and eventual sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Motivation for Starting Wealth Awesome

Several key reasons inspired the creation of Wealth Awesome:
*   **Digital Nomad Dream**: The founder's long-held dream was to become a digital nomad, someone with an online income source allowing them to travel and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Having previously backpacked around Asia, the founder loved the adventure and freedom of that lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Making a Positive Impact**: A desire to create something that would be a "net positive in the world," educating Canadians and providing a sense of purpose and joy by helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Skills**: The founder was already writing for Canadian media and investment publications on finance topics, like CTV News, and had gained a following of tens of thousands of monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. After a friend suggested starting their own financial education site, the founder assessed existing Canadian finance blogs and believed their content could be equally good or better, given their education and experience in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity and Passion**: Recognizing an opportunity to create quality content and share the digital nomad journey, combined with a love for writing, led to the site's launch in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Earning Income from the Site

Making income from blogging was not immediate. The first dollar was earned about a year after the site's launch, in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This was a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade, earned after writing over 150 articles and dedicating hundreds of hours to the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Income grew significantly from this point:
*   The initial goal of $3,000 per month was reached in February 2021, approximately a year and a half after the site started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   During peak months, the site earned over $20,000 per month, at one point nearly reaching $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   In total, over $500,000 was made from the website, excluding the confidential sale amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Income was primarily generated through two methods:
*   **Advertising**: Once a website reaches a certain traffic threshold (initially 50,000 visitors per month, later lowered to 10,000 per month by Mediavine), it can apply to premium ad networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille or per 1,000 visitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For finance content with Mediavine, RPMs were very high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This meant 10,000 visitors could generate around $500 USD (or nearly $700 CAD) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions**: This involves earning money by recommending and referring products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The founder only chose products they personally believed in and used, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank, which became top affiliate partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For instance, an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms would include links, and if someone signed up through those links, a commission (typically $50-$100, sometimes more like $150-$200) would be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Site Growth and Traffic

The site's growth started slowly. After writing about 100 articles and 11 months into the journey, around August 2020, the site began to gain traction, reaching about 5,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   By January 2021, traffic had increased tenfold to 50,000 visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   The site peaked at approximately 250,000 visitors per month during its height in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Overall, Wealth Awesome attracted about 5 million visitors throughout its years, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   A linked YouTube channel also grew to nearly 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The experience of building and running Wealth Awesome provided numerous valuable lessons:
*   **Technical Skills**: The founder, having no prior website building experience, learned how to design and build a site, perform search engine optimization (SEO), write content, create graphics, analyze website data, build affiliate networks, monetize a website, hire and manage people, and use various online business tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience**: Previous roles as an analyst aided in SEO and outreach data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Business-to-business sales experience helped promote the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Financial advisor experience contributed to writing useful content and connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Mental Toughness**: A critical lesson was learning to manage the ups and downs of running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Initially reactive to good or bad results, the founder learned to "ride out the bad results and carry on," realizing that not everything can be controlled or fixed, and that questioning motives is part of the journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck**: The timing of starting the site right before the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending more time online and looking for personal finance information, was seen as fortunate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Why the Site Was Sold

The decision to sell Wealth Awesome stemmed from several factors:
*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the founder started to lose passion for producing content and found it harder to be excited about working on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This highlighted a lesson about moving on when the "fire" is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of Blogging's Future**: Concerns about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates caused stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The sale itself happened unexpectedly. A good friend, Q, who had previously worked with the founder at CI Investments and had recently exited an online business, reached out to inquire about purchasing the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Q was building a portfolio of digital assets and wanted to add Wealth Awesome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The deal was finalized over a couple of weeks, with the founder pleased that the site was going to a trusted friend with fresh ideas and intelligence to grow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Current Endeavors

Following the sale of Wealth Awesome, the founder is now [[transitioning_from_blogging_to_a_financial_planning_company | starting a new business]]: a financial planning company called Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This company focuses on building customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The founder is passionate about this venture, believing that many people haven't optimized their finances and that real value can be brought to individuals and businesses across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This new path aligns with a favorite past job as a financial advisor, valuing the intimate one-on-one connection and personal satisfaction it provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Impact and Gratitude

The overall experience of owning Wealth Awesome has been overwhelmingly positive, profoundly changing the founder's life and helping many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The journey involved meeting many interesting people and making a significant impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Retirement marks a significant shift from decades of saving and investing to potentially spending what has been accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many retirees face the [[Save or Spend Dilemma for Retirees | save or spend dilemma]], grappling with how much to spend versus retaining their savings each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This transition can feel uncomfortable, requiring a complete mindset shift from scarcity to abundance, where individuals feel confident utilizing their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Finding the right balance between saving and spending is crucial for [[Comprehensive financial planning for retirement | a fulfilling retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The Risks of Under-spending in Retirement

Hesitating to spend during retirement can lead to several negative outcomes:

*   **Missed Experiences and Opportunities** Retirees who are reluctant to spend may miss out on enriching experiences such as travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could significantly enhance their quality of life in their golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These moments are key to a fulfilling retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Healthspan vs. Lifespan** Peter Attia's book *Outlive* distinguishes between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, actively, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting enjoyment of saved wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   [[Inflation Concerns and Retirement Spending | **Inflation's Impact**]] Inflation can erode the purchasing power of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While this is a concern, a well-structured retirement plan should account for inflation to ensure purchasing power remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The Benefits of Cautious Spending

While under-spending has drawbacks, not spending *all* your money can also be beneficial:

*   **Encourages Cautious Spending** A hesitation to spend can promote thoughtful, deliberate financial decisions, preventing impulse purchases and overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Helps Money Last (Reduces Longevity Risk)** A careful approach to spending ensures that funds stretch further, reducing the risk of running out of money prematurely, a common concern for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk (Sequence of Returns Risk)** Market losses early in retirement can deplete a portfolio faster than later losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Spending cautiously helps protect against this "sequence of returns risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   [[Legacy Goals vs Enjoying Retirement Savings | **Aligns with Legacy Goals**]] For many, leaving a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes is a significant priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Cautious spending allows retirees to achieve these [[Legacy Goals vs Enjoying Retirement Savings | legacy goals]] while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Ultimately, not spending enough can be detrimental, but it can also serve as a protective measure, increasing financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The core challenge for many retirees is not knowing how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This uncertainty often leads to erring on the side of caution to avoid running out of money, potentially sacrificing current enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. It is often possible to achieve all financial goals and spend more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

A [[Comprehensive financial planning for retirement | well-structured financial plan]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. By clearly outlining affordable spending limits and stress-testing investment portfolios, retirees can transition from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Case Study: Michael and Karen – Overcoming Hesitation to Spend

Michael (66) and Karen (64) had prepared for retirement with a high combined income ($180,000/year from pensions and investments) and substantial savings ($4 million in a diversified portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Their expenses were only $70,000 annually, leaving a significant surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Despite this, they were hesitant to increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving, which were their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Process** Their financial plan showed that with a sustainable withdrawal rate of 3.5% from their $4 million portfolio, they could easily withdraw an additional $140,000 annually, more than enough for their desired luxury spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams (Michael's pension, CPP, OAS) already covered basic expenses, leaving their investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution** Stress-testing their portfolio for poor market conditions (e.g., a 30% decline early on) confirmed its long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Longevity projections, assuming they lived to age 95, showed their portfolio would last well beyond their predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Outcome** Armed with this information, Michael and Karen gained confidence, booking luxury vacations, starting home renovations, and increasing charitable contributions, knowing their financial future was secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Case Study: Robert and Susan – Balancing Spending and Legacy Goals

Robert (70) and Susan (68) had a combined income of $100,000/year, expenses of $75,000/year, and $1.2 million in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Their primary goal was to leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They were cautious about increasing spending due to their [[Legacy Goals vs Enjoying Retirement Savings | legacy goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Process** Their financial analysis revealed that their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover expenses and increase discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Solution** It was recommended that they increase their spending slightly from $75,000 to $85,000 per year, allowing for more travel and experiences while maintaining their inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Stress-testing confirmed that even with potential market downturns, their spending was sustainable without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Outcome** With this new plan, Robert and Susan felt confident enjoying a higher quality of life now, knowing they could still leave a meaningful inheritance for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Clients with larger portfolios often find it harder to spend due to deeply ingrained savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. To ease into spending, try setting small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies, gradually shifting your mindset to enjoy retirement more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Don't let fear prevent you from enjoying your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices Canadians can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This decision is akin to a jigsaw puzzle, where factors such as life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams must fit together to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin CPP at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 often proves optimal for many, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## CPP Claiming Ages and Benefit Adjustments

Most Canadians claim CPP at age 60, with over 70% starting benefits at either age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, there are options to consider between ages 61-64 and 66-70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting at Age 60:** This reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction from age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, if a person qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, they would receive only $640 per month at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70:** This boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Using the same example, $1,000 per month at 65 would jump to $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Insights from Actuarial Studies on CPP Take-Up

A detailed 2020 [[Actuarial Studies and Reports on CPP | Actuarial study]] on when to start CPP highlights how life expectancy, probabilities, and expected investment returns influence the optimal claiming age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 60

This option is generally best for those with shorter life expectancy or immediate income needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Reduced Lifetime Payments:** A 36% reduction compared to starting at 65, significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those living beyond age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **High Investment Returns:** If investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking CPP at 60 allows for investment of payments and potentially higher returns, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations:** Starting early can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

> [00:03:31] **Example Scenario:** John, a 60-year-old with health issues and little savings, takes CPP early to secure income and avoid GIS clawbacks.

### Starting CPP at 65

This default option balances steady payments and avoids the need for savings to bridge income gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income:** Offers reliable inflation-adjusted income without requiring additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Tradeoffs:** Leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis:** Payments equalize with the 70-option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those unsure of their longevity or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

> [00:04:30] **Example Scenario:** Maria, age 65, retires with modest RSP savings and average health. She takes CPP now for predictable income without depleting savings.

### Delaying CPP to 70

Delaying provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, with maximum inflation-adjusted payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for those with [[Longer life expectancy and its impact on retirement | longer life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Longevity Protection:** Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return:** Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to around 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age:** For most, delaying CPP becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

> [00:05:32] **Example Scenario:** Susan, age 70, expects to live well into her late 80s or 90s with sufficient RSP funds. She delays CPP, maximizing her lifetime inflation-protected income.

## Estimating Your Life Expectancy

Your predicted investment returns and life expectancy are crucial factors in deciding when to take CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Actuarial and Statistical Data
The 2020 CPP take-up decision report highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Gender Differences:** Women tend to live longer than men, with 82% of women likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Healthy Lifestyle:** A healthy lifestyle or family history of long life increases odds (79% for men, 85% for women to live past 80) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **General Benefit of Delaying:** Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80, suggesting most retirees would benefit from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Stats Canada data further reveals insights into the average life expectancies of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Increased Life Expectancy with Age:** The older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For instance, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   [[Longer life expectancy and its impact on retirement | Life expectancy is longer than most people realize]] in Canada, often higher than the conventional wisdom of 80-82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Women's Benefits from Delaying:** Women consistently live longer across all age groups, reaching their late 80s or 90s, making delaying CPP to age 70 beneficial for higher inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Men's Considerations:** Men with shorter life expectancies should carefully balance longevity with their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Longevity Insurance:** Delaying CPP acts as a safety net, particularly for women who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Online Life Expectancy Calculators
Several online calculators can provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass:** Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity. It's quick (around 5 minutes) and offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Living to 100:** Based on the New England Centenarian Study, this tool asks detailed questions about health and habits, providing personalized feedback over 10-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [00:09:32] **Note:** Calculator results can differ (e.g., by 4 years), so they should be taken with a grain of salt, but they offer a more tailored outlook than general statistics.

### Refining Life Expectancy Estimates
For a deeper dive into methods to refine your life expectancy estimations:
*   **Genetic Testing:** Uncovers potential health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations:** Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing:** Advanced tests measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of your true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings:** Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, crucial for impacting longevity, are recommended annually, starting in your 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Using a CPP Present Value Calculator

While a CPP break-even table is a good starting point, it falls short by not considering investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A CPP present value calculator incorporates these additional factors for a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

One such tool, available on Tax Tips, allows users to input:
*   Estimated monthly benefit at age 65 (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Estimated annual indexation of CPP (inflation rate, e.g., 2.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   Desired start ages (60, 65, 70 are default) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Estimated life expectancy (e.g., 86 for a woman in her 50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Estimated rate of return for current/expected portfolio (e.g., 2-6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

**Example Scenario Analysis:**
*   With a life expectancy of 86 and a 2% rate of return: Age 70 has the highest present value (almost $320,000) compared to age 60 ($222,000) or 65 ($286,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   Increasing the rate of return to 4% narrows the gap: Age 60 (approx. $170,000), age 65 ($208,000), age 70 ($220,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. At 6%, the choice between 65 and 70 can even out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. A conservative rate of return (3-5%) is generally recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   Extreme Longevity (living to 100): Age 70 becomes by far the best choice, providing over $130,000 more in present value over starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   Shorter Life Expectancy (e.g., passing at 72): Starting CPP at age 60 would likely have been the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   Inflation Rate Impact: A higher inflation rate (e.g., 4%) still favors age 70, while very low inflation (e.g., 1%) makes the scenarios closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

> [00:14:25] **Important Note:** While the cumulative difference in payments can be large (e.g., $500,000), the present value difference is lower (e.g., $130,000), which is important for accurate comparisons.

## Holistic Retirement Planning

Deciding when to start CPP is a complex puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Financial advisors often consider additional factors to integrate CPP timing into a comprehensive [[Retirement Strategies Integrating CPP | retirement strategy]]:
*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points:** Analyzing how long you're likely to live and when delaying CPP becomes financially beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies:** Evaluating how CPP income interacts with your overall tax situation to minimize your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation:** Determining if delaying CPP can help avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks, or if starting earlier is better in certain scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination:** Integrating CPP with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources for the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Most often, delaying CPP into the late 60s or 70s shows benefits for clients, though exceptions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Strategic planning ensures optimized retirement income, with women potentially prioritizing strategies to extend income into their late 80s or 90s, while men focus on steady income for potentially shorter time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

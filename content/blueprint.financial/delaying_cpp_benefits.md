The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a vital source of income in retirement, but strategic decisions regarding when to start receiving benefits can significantly impact overall financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Avoiding common mistakes, such as overlooking tax implications or the advantages of delaying payments, can prevent substantial financial losses over the course of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Tax Implications and OAS Clawback

A significant mistake is to ignore the tax implications of CPP payments, which are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This can affect one's overall tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Consider David, a 67-year-old retiree with $90,000 annual income from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. By starting his CPP benefits early, he adds an additional $10,000 to his annual income, bringing his total to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Because CPP payments are taxable, this extra income pushes him into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Furthermore, as he also receives Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, his total income exceeding the 2024 threshold of $90,997 triggers an OAS clawback, reducing his OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For every $100 over the threshold, $15 of OAS is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

To avoid this, David could have [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delayed taking his CPP]] until age 70, or adjusted his income sources to minimize the tax impact and avoid the OAS clawback altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Ignoring these tax implications can lead to a lower-than-expected retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Delaying CPP vs. Investing Early

A common temptation is to start CPP benefits early, for instance at age 60, and invest the money in the stock market, hoping to outperform the returns gained by delaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While the stock market has historical average annual returns of 7% to 8%, it carries significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Market volatility, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis when the TSX index dropped over 30% and took years to recover, can severely impact investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

On the other hand, [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_age_60 | delaying CPP]] until age 70 significantly increases benefits by 42% compared to taking them at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly benefit at 65 would become $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This higher payment is indexed to inflation, preserving purchasing power over time, which is difficult to replicate with stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. To match this additional $420 monthly indexed benefit with a private annuity would require investing around $100,000 upfront between ages 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Delaying CPP secures a higher, inflation-adjusted income for life without needing to save such a large sum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Trying to outperform CPP by investing early is risky and often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying CPP]] offers a predictable and secure income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Impact on Spousal and Survivor Benefits

When planning a CPP strategy, it's crucial to consider the impact on a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Pension Sharing

Pension sharing allows spouses to split their CPP income, which can lead to tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For instance, if one spouse receives $1,200 per month in CPP and the other receives very little, they can share the CPP so each reports about $600 in income, leading to overall tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### CPP Survivor Benefit

The CPP Survivor benefit provides ongoing income to a spouse if the contributor passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The amount received by the survivor heavily depends on when the deceased started their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. If CPP is started at age 60, the monthly benefits are reduced by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. For example, if benefits at 65 would have been $1,000 a month, starting at 60 reduces it to $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If the contributor then passes away, their spouse might receive 60% of that reduced amount (around $384 per month) instead of the $600 they could have received if the contributor had waited until 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. [[how_to_maximize_cpp_survivorship_pension_benefits | Ignoring these factors]] can result in less financial support for the surviving spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB)

Many Canadians overlook the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB), which can boost income if one continues working after starting to receive CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The PRB provides additional CPP payments based on continued earnings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For someone working at 67 and contributing close to the maximum CPP earning limit, these additional contributions could increase CPP income by up to $44.46 per month starting the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. These amounts, though seemingly small initially, are for life and indexed to inflation, growing over time to provide a significant boost in retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Ignoring the PRB means missing out on this extra income for those who plan to continue working after beginning to receive CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Avoiding Over-Reliance on CPP

Relying too heavily on CPP as the sole or main source of retirement income can lead to financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While CPP is designed to replace about one-third (33%) of the average worker's pre-retirement earnings, this is typically insufficient to maintain one's standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For example, if someone earned $40,000 a year before retirement, CPP might provide around $13,200 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This amount is unlikely to cover all expenses, especially considering rising costs for healthcare, housing, and daily living, plus the fact that it is a taxable expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Over-reliance on CPP can force retirees to cut back on their lifestyle or deplete savings faster than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. To ensure a comfortable retirement, it is important to have other income sources such as personal savings, investments, or other pension plans like an RSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. CPP should be viewed as just one piece of a broader retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

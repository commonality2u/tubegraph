Many Canadians are surprised to find they won't receive the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefit, which was around $2,034 per month in 2024, despite decades of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The average payment at age 60 is significantly lower, around $530 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

There are three primary [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | factors affecting your payout]] that determine how close you get to the maximum: your earnings history, when you start collecting CPP, and the consistency of your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## 1. Earning a High Salary Doesn't Guarantee a Max CPP Payout

To achieve the maximum CPP payout, your salary and income must consistently meet the maximum contribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. However, what qualifies as "maximum" has changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

With the introduction of CPP2, a new layer to consider emerged starting in 2024: a second earning ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This means higher income earners now contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In 2024, this new second ceiling, called the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE), is $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. You generally need to earn this amount or more per year to receive maximum CPP payments upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Historically, the maximum threshold has steadily increased, making it more challenging to reach the maximum CPP benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
*   In 1990, you needed to earn $28,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   In 2000, it was $37,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   In 2010, it was $47,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

What qualified as a high enough salary for maximum CPP in the past is insufficient today, and this trend of increasing thresholds is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

> Even if you've earned at least the maximum YAMPE every year for nearly four decades and start collecting CPP at age 60, you might only receive around $917 per month, which is less than half of the potential maximum payout of $2,034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This illustrates that a high income alone doesn't guarantee the maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## 2. Delaying CPP: Why Timing Matters

One of the most significant [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | factors influencing the decision on when to start CPP]] is the timing of your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The longer you wait to collect CPP, the higher your monthly payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Here's how CPP payments change based on when you start collecting:
*   **Age 60**: Average monthly payment is $540, with a maximum possible amount of $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Starting at 60 reduces your payments by about 36%, and this reduction lasts for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Age 65**: Average monthly payment jumps to $888, with a maximum of $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Age 70**: Delaying until 70 boosts your pay by 42% compared to taking it at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Despite the significant financial benefits of waiting, less than 2% of Canadians delay CPP until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning your payments will continue to rise over time to keep up with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In recent years, CPP payouts have increased significantly due to higher inflation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Consider delaying Old Age Security (OAS) alongside CPP, as it also increases by 0.6% per month after age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

While delaying CPP offers significant benefits, it's not suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Factors like your life expectancy, overall financial situation, and immediate income needs should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## 3. Contribution Gaps: Why Even High Earners Can Fall Short

Even if you earn a high salary and delay CPP until age 70, you might still not receive the full maximum payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This is because CPP is based on your *lifetime contributions*, not just your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. To get the maximum CPP payout, you need to have at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Many people fall short due to gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Common reasons for contribution gaps include:
*   **Career Breaks**: Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care can result in years with no CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While the child-rearing provision can help, many still have gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership**: If you were self-employed, paid lower CPP contributions, or didn't contribute consistently, this can lower your lifetime average even with high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment**: Being unemployed for a few years, even if followed by a very high salary, can drag down your average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry**: Retiring before age 65 or starting work later in life might mean you don't accumulate the full 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

> For example, if Jerry and Elaine both had high incomes and delayed CPP to 70, Elaine received the full $2,034 because she had 39 years of maximum contributions with no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Jerry, however, received less than $1,500 because he had many contribution gaps due to time off for business, school, or unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### How Contribution Gaps Affect Your Final CPP Pay

CPP uses your "best 39 years" of contributions to calculate your retirement benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. To assist with inconsistent work histories, CPP includes a General Dropout Provision, which allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest-earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Since CPP considers 47 years of potential contributions (ages 18-65), this provision allows you to drop about 8 years of low or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you delay CPP to 70, your total working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains roughly 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While this helps mitigate the impact of short gaps, if you miss more than 8 years of contributions, your final payout will be lower, even with high earnings and delayed collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## How to Maximize Your CPP Based on These Three Key Factors

Think of CPP as a three-legged stool: your payout depends on salary, timing, and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. To maximize your CPP, you'll need to optimize all three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Here are [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | strategies to optimize CPP benefits]]:

### 1. Delay CPP as Late as Possible (Ideally Age 70)
*   **Boost**: Delaying past 65 increases your CPP by 8.4% per year, resulting in a 42% boost at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Starting before 65 decreases it by 7.2% per year, leading to a 36% reduction at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Planning**: This is often the easiest way to increase your payout without changing your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It requires careful financial planning to have other income sources (e.g., investments, TFSAs, RRSPs) to cover expenses while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### 2. Earn at Least the YAMPE for as Many Years as Possible
*   **Increase Income**: While challenging, increasing your income directly increases your CPP payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Strategies**: Negotiate higher wages and promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Consider starting a side hustle or business (and ensure you contribute to CPP if self-employed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Invest in certifications, training, or new skills to qualify for higher-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Strategically switch jobs, as changing employers can often lead to faster salary growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Avoid Contribution Gaps and Maximize Your Contribution Years
*   **Consistency**: Aim to work for at least 39 years with strong contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Missing too many years will lower your average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Dropout Provisions**: CPP allows you to drop up to 8 years of lower or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. However, if you miss more than that, your payouts will be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Provision**: If you took time off to raise children under seven, try to use the child-rearing provision to exclude those low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Maximizing your CPP isn't just about earning more; it's about making smart decisions regarding your contributions and when you start collecting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The right strategy can mean hundreds more per month in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

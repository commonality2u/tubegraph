Taxes can be a significant obstacle to investment growth, particularly in Canada, where they can consume up to half of investment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, various strategies can help reduce tax bills and accelerate wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Among these, [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] and tax loss harvesting are advanced techniques that can significantly impact your financial position.

## [[income_splitting_strategies | Income Splitting]]
[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is an advanced strategy aimed at reducing overall household tax burdens by distributing income among family members, typically spouses, to take advantage of lower marginal tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Using FHSA for [[income_splitting_strategies | Income Splitting]]
The First Home Savings Account (FHSA), often perceived as solely for home savings, can also be a tool for couples to save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Who it's for** Couples where one partner has maximized their tax-advantaged accounts (like RSP, TFSA, FHSA) and the other has unused FHSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **How it works** The higher-income partner can gift money to the lower-income partner, who then contributes it to their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This approach helps the couple avoid investing in a taxable account, allows for a tax deduction, and enables tax-free growth within the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Example** Jim gives $8,000 to Pam, who has unused FHSA room. Pam receives a $2,400 tax deduction, avoids $132 in taxes on growth, and all future growth within the FHSA is tax-free, leading to a total saving of $2,532 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Spousal RSP Contributions
Spousal RSPs are designed to help balance [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement incomes]] and reduce taxes for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **How it works** The higher-income spouse contributes to the lower-income spouse's RSP, receiving an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. In retirement, the lower-income spouse withdraws the funds at their typically lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Example** Jim contributes $12,000 to Pam's RSP, which lowers Jim's taxes by $4,200. When Pam withdraws the funds in retirement, she pays only $2,400 in taxes, resulting in an overall couple saving of $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### Splitting Capital Losses
Investment losses can be strategically used to generate tax savings by transferring capital losses between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Example** Jim's $4,000 capital loss can be used to reduce Pam's $15,000 in capital gains, saving the couple $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip]
> This strategy is applicable only in non-registered accounts, and the buying spouse must hold the shares for a minimum of 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Tax Loss Harvesting
Tax loss harvesting is a strategy that allows investors to reduce their tax burden by using losing investments to offset capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. It shares similarities with the capital loss splitting strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

*   **How it works** If you sell an investment at a loss, you can use that loss to reduce the taxes on gains from other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. If your losses exceed your gains, you can carry those losses forward to future years or even back to previous years to obtain a tax refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Example** If you realized a $10,000 stock gain earlier in the year, you could sell another stock that is down by $6,000. This $6,000 loss would offset part of your gain, meaning you would only be taxed on $4,000 instead of the original $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

> [!Warning] The Superficial Loss Rule
> Be mindful of the Superficial Loss Rule. If you or your spouse repurchase the same stock within 30 days of selling it, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will disallow the loss. Instead, the loss is added to the cost of your newly acquired shares, delaying your ability to benefit from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Bonus Tips to Avoid Costly Mistakes
Even the most effective [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | tax saving strategies]] can backfire if common mistakes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Overcontributing to Registered Accounts** Exceeding the contribution limits for TFSAs or RSPs can lead to significant penalties, specifically 1% of the excess amount per month. Always track your limits to avoid these unnecessary costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Forgetting About Deadlines** Certain strategies, such as RSP contributions, have strict deadlines (e.g., 60 days after year-end). Missing these deadlines can result in the loss of tax deductions for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Not Planning for Withdrawals** Withdrawals from registered accounts, especially RSPs, can trigger unexpected taxes. It is crucial to have a plan for managing these withdrawals tax-efficiently, particularly during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

These [[advanced_retirement_tax_strategies_like_family_trusts_and_individual_pension_plans | advanced tax strategies]] can save thousands in taxes and significantly boost wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Calculating Your Deduction

The deduction amount is based on the percentage of your home used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>:
1.  **Determine Workspace Percentage:** Measure the size of your dedicated workspace and compare it to the total size of your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If your workspace is 200 square feet and your home is 1,000 square feet, your workspace percentage is 20% (200 / 1000 = 0.20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
2.  **Calculate Deduction:** Multiply your total eligible expenses by your calculated workspace percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If your total eligible expenses are $5,000 and your workspace percentage is 20%, you can claim a deduction of $1,000 ($5,000 * 0.20 = $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64, representing 37.8% of that age group, are heading into retirement alone, identifying as single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For these individuals, retirement planning significantly changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The median after-tax income for single seniors aged 65 and older in Canada, as of 2022, is $30,820 per year ($2,568 per month), which is significantly lower than the $74,200 per year ($6,200 per month) for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. This means single seniors earn less than 50% of what couples earn in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Retiring alone presents unique [[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | financial challenges]], as there's no partner to split costs, share benefits, or provide a safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. Singles often face higher taxes, less government support, and greater pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Higher Tax Burden

One of the biggest financial risks for single retirees is a higher tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. While not an official tax, retiring single in Canada often results in paying more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### Lack of Income Splitting and Spousal Benefits
Without access to [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently find themselves in higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario with $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income. This is because a couple could split their income and both qualify for full Old Age Security (OAS) and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

[[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Tax planning]] is crucial for single retirees, as they lack access to [[income_splitting_and_spousal_retirement_savings | income splitting]] or survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Every withdrawal decision can significantly impact the tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.

### Strategic Withdrawals to Reduce Taxes
Smart ways to reduce your tax bill in retirement include strategic timing and drawdown of funds from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>:
*   **RRSP and TFSA:** How and when you withdraw money from your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can greatly affect how much you keep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **CPP and OAS:** The timing of taking [[tax_implications_of_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and OAS benefits also has a big impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Smart timing and drawdown strategies can save thousands in taxes over the course of your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### No Survivor Benefits
A significant financial disadvantage of retiring single is the lack of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. If you are not part of a couple, there's no automatic rollover for your RRSPs, Registered Income Funds (RIFs), or pensions when you pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This can lead to a substantial tax hit on your estate, leaving less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### Planning to Protect Your Estate
To protect your assets and minimize estate taxes:
*   **Careful RRSP and RIF Withdrawals:** Plan your [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP]] and RIF withdrawals carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Gradual withdrawals can help reduce the final tax burden on your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review:** Regularly review your beneficiaries for RRSPs, TFSAs, and insurance designations to ensure assets go where you intend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire
Andy Dwire, a single 65-year-old planning to retire, initially worried about having enough saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. His assets included $200,000 in an RRSP and $100,000 in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. He planned to take CPP and OAS at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

### Initial Tax Implications
By taking CPP and OAS at age 65, Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 would be very low because he would be withdrawing primarily from his TFSA, which is not counted as income, rather than his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

### Smoothing Taxes with an RRSP Meltdown
To smooth out his taxes and optimize his plan, Andy was advised to perform an "RRSP meltdown" by withdrawing $30,000 per year from his RRSP between ages 65 and 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>. This strategy helps cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This approach smoothed his effective tax rate to a low 2-3% during those initial years, not exceeding 4% until age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. This strategy eliminated his projected shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

## Other Strategies for Financial Security
To build a larger buffer for retirement, Andy could also consider:
*   **Working an extra year:** Earning $80,000 for one more year would increase his funding to 114% of his goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.
*   **Supplemental income sources:** Earning $10,000 annually for six years from a woodworking hobby could bring his funding to 112% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Similarly, Airbnb-ing his condo during the summer for six years could also yield $10,000 annually, keeping him at 112% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. These options are often preferred as they allow for an earlier retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

Retirement as a single person in Canada can be challenging, but with proper planning, you can stretch every dollar, avoid significant tax burdens, and achieve a confident retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>.

Many Canadians mistakenly believe that when a salary increase moves them into a higher tax bracket, their entire income will be taxed at the new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This misconception can lead to the feeling that earning more money might actually result in taking home less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, this is not how Canada's [[progressive_tax_system_explained | tax system]] works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## How Tax Brackets Apply

When you receive a raise, for example, from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, you might enter a new federal tax bracket, such as moving from 15% to 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, only the portion of your income that falls into the new bracket is taxed at the higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For instance, the first $57,375 of your income would still be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Only the income *above* that threshold, in this example, an additional $2,625, would be taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The majority of your income remains taxed at the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Average vs. Marginal Tax Rates

This system means that your average or effective tax rate is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax bracket you've entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, even if you move into a higher tax bracket, you will always take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

It's important not to let [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | tax myths]] deter you from pursuing a raise, as [[benefits_of_income_growth_despite_tax_increases | income growth is always advantageous]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

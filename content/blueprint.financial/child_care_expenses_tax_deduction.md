To claim [[Child Care Expenses Tax Deduction | child care expenses]], the child must be under 16 years old or have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Eligible Expenses

You can claim expenses for:
*   Daycare centers and nurseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Caregivers like nannies or babysitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Boarding schools and overnight camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   Educational institutions, for the portion related to child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

## Ineligible Expenses

You cannot claim expenses for:
*   Medical or hospital care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   Tuition for regular schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Recreational activities such as sports or art classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

## Claim Limits

The maximum amount you can claim per child depends on their age and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>:
*   Under 7 years of age: up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   Between 7 and 16 years of age: $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   If they have a disability: $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>

## Example

Imagine you have two children, ages 4 and 9, in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   You spent $6,000 on daycare for the 4-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   You spent $4,000 on after-school care for the 9-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Since both amounts are under the maximum allowable deduction for their respective age categories ($8,000 for under 7, $5,000 for 7-16), you can claim the full $6,000 and $4,000, totaling $10,000 that you can deduct on your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Non-Claimable Expenses

Certain expenses commonly associated with children cannot be claimed as [[childrelated_tax_benefits_and_deductions | child care expenses]]:

## Claim Limits

The maximum amount that can be claimed per child varies based on their age and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">00:04:21</a>:
*   **Under 7 years of age**: Up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">00:04:26</a>
*   **Between 7 and 16 years of age**: Up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">00:04:28</a>

## Example

Imagine a family with two children, aged 4 and 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">00:04:35</a>.
*   In 2023, they spent $6,000 on daycare for the 4-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">00:04:39</a>.
*   They also spent $4,000 on after-school care for the 9-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">00:04:41</a>.

Since both amounts are below their respective maximum allowable deductions ($8,000 for the 4-year-old and $5,000 for the 9-year-old), the family can claim the full $6,000 and $4,000, totaling $10,000, which they can deduct on their taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">00:04:46</a>.

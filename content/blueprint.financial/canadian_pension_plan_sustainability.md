Despite concerns among 64% of Canadians that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) might not be available when they retire, largely due to factors like aging populations, rising costs, and discussions about Alberta leaving the CPP, the fund is more secure than generally perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Several key reasons contribute to its robust [[longterm_sustainability_of_the_cpp_fund | long-term sustainability]].

## Why the CPP Won't Run Out

### 1. Outperforming Expectations

The CPP fund has consistently outperformed initial projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return, pushing the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This total asset amount significantly exceeds earlier expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For instance, projections made in 2000 anticipated the CPP reaching $425 billion by 2023; instead, it reached $632 billion in 2023, surpassing projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This strong performance reflects sound investment strategies and resilience, even during challenging economic periods like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the fund continued to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such growth ensures the CPP can effectively manage the increasing number of retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### 2. Sustainability for Generations

The future of the CPP is focused on ensuring care for present and future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The Chief Actuary of Canada conducts a detailed review of the CPP's financial health every three years, with the latest report indicating the CPP is on solid ground for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Projections show impressive growth:
*   By 2030, the fund is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   By 2040, assets are projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   By 2050, the fund is anticipated to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

These forecasts highlight the [[longterm_sustainability_of_the_cpp_fund | long-term sustainability]] of the CPP, positioning it to support current and future generations of Canadians. The CPP is likely to remain financially stable for at least 75 years, extending its solvency into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### 3. Trustworthiness of Reporting

The accuracy and reliability of CPP reports are ensured through multiple layers of independent oversight:

*   **Chief Actuary of Canada**: This office conducts independent assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health, free from political influence, ensuring reports are accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The 31st Actuarial report, completed in 2022, confirmed the CPP's sustainability for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)**: The PBO independently reviews these reports, known for its nonpartisan, transparent, and objective financial analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **External Audits**: Further assurance comes from external auditors, such as Deloitte's 2022 audit, which confirmed CPP Investments maintained effective internal control over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

With these rigorous and independent oversight mechanisms, the CPP is considered one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For Canadians, this translates to peace of mind, knowing the CPP is thoroughly reviewed and projected to last for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When evaluating financial reports, it is a recommended "pro tip" to always seek independent audits or third-party reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### 4. Investment Performance and Management

The successful performance and management of CPP Investments are crucial to its [[longterm_sustainability_of_the_cpp_fund | long-term sustainability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   **Strong Long-Term Returns**: CPP Investments has delivered a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This has propelled the fund's assets to $632 billion, exceeding projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Diversified Global Portfolio**: The fund is globally diversified across 56 countries, investing in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the majority spread across international markets to mitigate "home risk" and reliance on a single economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Active Management Strategy**: CPP Investments employs an active management approach, aiming to outperform passive strategies over the long term through investments in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While this strategy may lead to underperformance in some years (e.g., an 8% net return for fiscal 2024 fell short of the reference portfolio's 19.9% return), active management is essential for a pension fund like CPP to address pension payouts and actuarial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The significant growth of CPP assets to $632 billion, well above projections, indicates sound investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The CPP serves as Canada's reliable retirement backbone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

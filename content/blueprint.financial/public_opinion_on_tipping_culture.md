Public sentiment towards [[current_tipping_practices_in_canada | tipping culture in Canada]] has become increasingly complex and critical. While some Canadians are on board with current practices, many are questioning the necessity of continuous tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Rising Pressure and Frustration
Recent reports indicate a growing frustration with tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>:
*   64% of Canadians report being asked to tip more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   62% feel pressured to leave higher tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   "Tipflation" has seen standards rise sharply; in 2016, 43% of Canadians tipped under 15%, but now only 23% do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Conversely, the number tipping 20% or more has doubled from 8% in 2016 to 21% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   "Tip creep" is also causing fatigue, with 83% of Canadians stating too many places now ask for tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Only 13% feel that service has actually improved as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   British Columbia reports the highest levels of tip creep (74%) and tipflation (73%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Desire for Alternative Models
A significant majority of Canadians now prefer a service-included model with higher wages for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This model is seen as a way to avoid the perceived "polite mugging" associated with current tipping expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Perceptions of the System's Impact
73% of Canadians believe the current tipping system allows employers to underpay their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. What once felt like a genuine thank you for great service now often feels like a mandatory part of the bill, expected regardless of service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. From a worker's perspective, there's a perception that people tip out of obligation rather than genuine desire, leading to a dynamic where tips are seen as a right rather than a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Impact of Technology on Public Opinion
The rise of [[impact_of_technology_on_tipping_culture | digital payment options]], particularly tipping machines, has made tipping more public and uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The on-screen prompts for high tip percentages (15%, 20%, or even 30%) with the cashier watching create pressure, making a "no tip" selection feel like an admission of being cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This public, guilt-driven moment pushes for higher tips, turning a personal choice into an uncomfortable interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Looking Ahead
While tipping in Canada is deeply ingrained in culture and isn't expected to disappear soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, there is growing "tipping fatigue" among consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This fatigue could lead to more pushback against higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> and a greater demand for consumer choice in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. The vocalness of consumers is expected to influence the general direction of tipping practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

In 2019, the website Wealth Awesome.com was launched with a financial goal of generating $3,000 per month and attracting 30,000 monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The creator not only achieved but exceeded these goals by nearly ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article details the journey of Wealth Awesome, from its inception to its eventual sale, including how it generated income and the lessons learned along the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Why Start a Financial Blog?

Several motivations led to the creation of Wealth Awesome:

*   **Digital Nomad Dream** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>: The creator harbored a long-standing dream of becoming a digital nomadâ€”someone with an online income source that allows them to travel the world and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Having grown up in Alberta and worked in finance and energy in Vancouver, the desire for freedom to work from anywhere and be their own boss was strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Previous backpacking experiences in Asia fostered a love for adventure and a lifestyle of freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This directly relates to [[making_money_while_living_overseas | making money while living overseas]].
*   **Creating Positive Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>: A key goal was to create something that would be a net positive in the world, specifically by educating Canadians about finance and providing a sense of purpose and joy through helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>: The journey began by writing for Canadian media and investment publications on finance topics, like CTV News, which led to a substantial readership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A friend suggested starting a personal financial education site, as the content was already well-received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Recognizing an opportunity to create high-quality content equal to or better than existing Canadian financial blogs, and with a passion for writing, the decision to [[starting_a_finance_blog | start the site]] in September 2019 was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Income Generation and Growth

Earning income from the blog was not immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The first $50 affiliate commission from Questrade was earned in November 2020, about a year after launch, after writing over 150 articles and dedicating hundreds of hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. However, this marked a turning point, and income quickly snowballed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The initial goal of $3,000 per month was reached by February 2021, approximately a year and a half after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. At its peak, the site earned over $20,000 per month, almost reaching $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In total, the website generated over $500,000, excluding its eventual sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Income was primarily generated through two main strategies:

*   **Advertising** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>: Once a website achieves significant traffic (e.g., 50,000 visitors per month, later lowered to 10,000), it can apply for premium ad networks like Mediavine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These networks manage advertisers, paying out based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille or thousand visitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For finance content with Mediavine, RPMs were exceptionally high, reaching up to $50 USD per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This meant 10,000 visitors could generate approximately $500 USD (or close to $700 Canadian) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>: This involves earning money by recommending and referring products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The creator only promoted products they personally used and believed in, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank, which became top affiliate partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For example, an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms included links to recommended products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. When a user signed up through these links, a commission ranging from $50 to $100 (sometimes $150-$200) would be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This created a win-win scenario where users found valuable products, and the creator was compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Website Traffic and Reach

Traffic started slowly; it took about 11 months and 100 articles to gain traction, reaching 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. By January 2021, traffic had increased tenfold to 50,000 monthly visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The site peaked at approximately 250,000 visitors per month in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Over its lifespan, Wealth Awesome accumulated about 5 million visitors, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. A linked YouTube channel also grew to almost 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Hard Lessons Learned

The blogging journey provided valuable lessons:

*   **Technical and Business Skills** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>: The creator learned how to design and build a website, perform Search Engine Optimization (SEO), create content and graphics, analyze website data, build an affiliate partner network, monetize a website, hire and manage staff, and utilize numerous online business tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>: Previous roles as an analyst aided in SEO and outreach data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, business-to-business sales experience helped promote the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, and financial advisor experience contributed to writing useful content and connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. These are all relevant to [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth | strategies for increasing personal net worth]] and [[strategies_for_increasing_income_and_net_worth_in_canada | strategies for increasing income and net worth in Canada]].
*   **Personal Growth and Resilience** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>: Running a business, especially for the first time, taught the importance of managing challenges and the ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Developing mental toughness was crucial to ride out bad results, understand that not everything can be fixed, and continue working despite setbacks or questioning motives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>: The site's launch just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people were at home and seeking personal finance information, proved to be a fortunate timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The main takeaway was that while not everything is controllable, one can control their reaction to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling Wealth Awesome

The site was sold for several reasons:

*   **Loss of Passion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>: After several years, the creator found it increasingly difficult to remain motivated and excited about producing content, suggesting it was time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty about Blogging's Future** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>: Concerns about the impact of AI advancements, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates caused stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Opportunity to Sell to a Trusted Friend** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>: A former colleague, Q, who was building a portfolio of digital assets, approached the creator about purchasing the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The deal was finalized in a couple of weeks, allowing the site to transition to a trusted friend who could bring fresh ideas and manage its new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## The Next Chapter

Currently, the creator is focused on a new venture: Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This financial planning company builds customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The passion for this new business stems from a belief that many people haven't optimized their finances and that significant value can be brought to individuals and businesses across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The creator's favorite past job was working as a financial advisor due to the intimate one-on-one connections and personal satisfaction gained from helping others achieve their financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The new company aligns with [[understanding_income_sources_and_withdrawal_strategies_in_retirement | understanding income sources and withdrawal strategies in retirement]] and [[tracking_and_analyzing_your_net_worth | tracking and analyzing your net worth]].

The overall experience with Wealth Awesome has been overwhelmingly positive, profoundly changing the creator's life and helping many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

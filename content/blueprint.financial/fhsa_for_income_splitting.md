[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] can be a complex but highly effective strategy for managing taxes within a partnership, with some individuals saving over six figures in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) presents a lesser-known, yet powerful, approach for couples to achieve tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## How the FHSA Strategy Works
This strategy is particularly beneficial for couples where one partner has unused FHSA contribution room, and the other has already maximized their other tax-advantaged accounts, such as an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The FHSA offers tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The higher-income partner, who has maxed out their own accounts, can gift money to their partner who has available FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This prevents the gifted funds from being invested in a taxable, non-registered account under the higher-income partner's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Instead, the receiving partner gains a tax deduction and benefits from tax-free investment growth within the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin
Ted has maxed out his registered accounts, while Robin has not yet contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
1.  **Without FHSA:** If Ted invested $8,000 in a taxable account, he would pay approximately $132 annually in taxes on $400 of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
2.  **With FHSA:** Ted gifts $8,000 to Robin, who contributes it to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Robin receives an immediate tax deduction of $2,400 and avoids taxes on the $400 in investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This results in a combined saving of $2,532, plus all future investment growth remains tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Pros of the FHSA Income Splitting Strategy
*   **Double Benefit:** Ted avoids taxable investment growth in his name, while Robin gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** When the FHSA is used for a home purchase, withdrawals are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** If the FHSA is not used for a home, it can be rolled over into an RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Cons of the FHSA Income Splitting Strategy
*   **Eligibility:** The receiving partner must not have owned a home in the past four years to qualify for the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Ownership Risk:** Gifted funds legally belong to the receiving partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. If the relationship ends, the gifting partner may have difficulty reclaiming the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

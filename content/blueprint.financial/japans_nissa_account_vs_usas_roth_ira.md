In a global showdown of tax-free accounts, Japan's Nisa account and the USA's Roth IRA faced off in a semi-final matchup to determine which account would advance to the championship round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Semi-Final Breakdown

### Contribution Limit
Japan's revamped Nisa offers two contribution pathways:
*   **Growth Nisa:** Up to 2.4 million yen per year, which translates to approximately $23,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This option is a "powerhouse" for those looking to invest more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Tsumitate Nisa:** Up to 1.2 million yen per year, equivalent to roughly $11,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Even the lower Tsumitate Nisa amount surpasses the Roth IRA's limit of $7,000 USD (around $9,500 Canadian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### Flexibility
Japan's Nisa allows tax-free withdrawals at any time, with no age restrictions from either account type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. While withdrawn amounts cannot be recontributed, this freedom to access funds without penalty offers a clear advantage over the Roth IRA's rules on early earnings withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Lifetime Limit
The Roth IRA boasts a growing lifetime contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Japan's new Nisa increased its lifetime cap to approximately 18 million yen, or about $174,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Despite this improvement, the Nisa's capped lifetime limit restricts its long-term growth potential compared to the Roth IRA's uncapped growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Simplicity
The Roth IRA is generally simpler to understand than Japan's Nisa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Nisa's two account types, lifetime tracking, and overlapping rules can be complex for new investors to navigate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Outcome: USA Wins in Overtime

At the end of regulation, the score was tied 2-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The match proceeded to overtime, where the Roth IRA's unlimited lifetime contribution space proved decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Although Japan's Nisa fought strongly with higher annual limits and greater flexibility, its lower lifetime cap ultimately limited its long-term advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The final score was USA 3, Japan 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

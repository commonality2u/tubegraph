One of the most significant [[Factors Influencing CPP Start Age Decision | factors determining your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout]] is the age at which you begin collecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Generally, the longer you wait, the higher your monthly payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Why Timing Matters for CPP Benefits

The difference in CPP payments based on when you start collecting can be substantial:
*   **Starting at Age 60:** The average monthly payment is around $540, with a maximum possible amount of $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Starting CPP at age 60 reduces your payments by approximately 36%, and this reduction is permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This is an [[Advantages and disadvantages of early CPP withdrawal | early withdrawal scenario]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Starting at Age 65:** The average payment jumps to $888, with a maximum of $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70:** Delaying until age 70 can boost your payment by 42% compared to taking it at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Despite these significant [[Benefits of delaying CPP past 60 | financial incentives for delaying CPP]], less than 2% of Canadians actually delay collecting CPP until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This means the vast majority of Canadians do not receive the maximum possible amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> [!info] Inflation Indexing
> CPP payments are indexed to inflation, meaning your payments will continue to rise over time to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In recent years, payouts have increased significantly due to higher inflation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

OAS also increases by 0.6% per month after age 65, which can contribute significantly to your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Factors to Consider When Deciding

While delaying CPP offers significant financial benefits, it's not suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Key [[Factors Influencing CPP Start Age Decision | considerations]] include your life expectancy, overall financial situation, and immediate income needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For a detailed breakdown of how to determine the best age to start CPP based on individual circumstances, refer to dedicated resources on [[Timing of CPP Benefits | CPP timing decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Even if you delay CPP until age 70 and have consistently earned a high salary, receiving the maximum payment is not guaranteed if you have significant contribution gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. CPP payouts are based on your lifetime contributions, not just your income, and require at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize CPP by Delaying

To optimize your CPP payout, one of the most effective [[Strategies to delay CPP and OAS for higher benefits | strategies]] is to delay collection as late as possible, ideally until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Increased Payout:** Delaying CPP past age 65 increases your benefit by 8.4% per year, leading to a potential 42% boost at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Conversely, starting before 65 decreases your CPP by 7.2% per year, resulting in up to a 36% reduction at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Financial Planning:** This strategy requires careful financial planning to ensure you have other income sources (such as investments, TFSAs, and RRSPs) to cover expenses while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The decision to delay CPP is a critical component of maximizing your retirement income, alongside earning a high salary and maintaining consistent contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Tax season is not merely about paperwork; it's about retaining more of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Simple errors, however, can lead to significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Avoiding these common mistakes can help you secure more of your hard-earned money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## 1. Filing Late or Not Filing at All

Filing your taxes late can be a very costly error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Owed Taxes** If you owe taxes, the CRA imposes a 5% penalty on the unpaid balance, plus an additional 1% per month until the amount is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Delayed Refunds and Benefits** Even if you don't owe taxes, filing late can delay your tax refunds and benefits, such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Increased Penalties** Repeated late filing can lead to increased penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

**Solution:** Set reminders well before the April 30th deadline to avoid last-minute stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If you anticipate owing taxes, file on time even if you cannot pay immediately, to avoid penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## 2. Forgetting to Report All Income

The CRA has access to your T4s, T5s, and other income records, which they cross-check against your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Failing to report income can lead to penalties and potential audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Commonly Missed Income** This includes employment income, rental income, side hustle earnings, and investment dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Platform Reporting** Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now report income directly to the CRA, meaning unreported earnings can trigger automatic reassessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Unreported Income** If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current return and have missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a penalty of 10% of the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

**Solution:** Ensure all income sources are accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Always check your My CRA account to confirm all tax slips are included before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Maintaining accurate records of all income sources helps prevent costly tax surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## 3. Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs

Exceeding your RRSP or TFSA contribution limit can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Penalties** Excess RRSP contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty until withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. TFSA contributions also incur a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Common Misconception** Many taxpayers mistakenly believe the CRA will notify them of [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_growing_a_tfsa | overcontributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Penalties will quietly accumulate until the mistake is realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

**Solution:** Track your contributions yourself rather than relying solely on your My CRA account, as it may not be updated in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If you discover an [[common_mistakes_in_tfsa_investing | overcontribution]], withdraw the excess as soon as possible to minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip:** You are permitted to exceed your RRSP limit by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties, providing a small buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This buffer does not apply to TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## 4. Missing Out on Deductions and Credits

Many Canadians overlook valuable tax deductions and credits that can reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Commonly Missed Deductions** These include medical expenses (prescription drugs, dental treatments, travel costs for medical care), moving expenses for work or school, and union and professional membership dues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Student Credits** Students often forget they can carry forward unused tuition credits or transfer them to a parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

**Solution:** Review your eligibility for these deductions to potentially receive a larger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Always keep receipts and records, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## 5. Claiming Ineligible Write-Offs

The CRA is stringent about business and employment deductions, and incorrect claims can lead to audits and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

*   **Home Office Expenses** You can only deduct home office costs if your workspace is your primary place of work or used exclusively for work-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Eligible expenses include utilities, rent, and internet for the portion of your home used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Business Expense Write-Offs** Deductions for items like meals, travel, and vehicle costs must be reasonable, directly related to earning income, and supported by receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Personal expenses disguised as business costs may be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Paying Family Members** If you hire a spouse or child, their salary must reflect actual work performed; unjustified payments may be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## 6. Forgetting to Claim Capital Losses

If you have sold investments (like stocks or ETFs) or property at a loss, you might be able to use those losses to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   The CRA allows you to carry forward capital losses indefinitely or apply them to gains from the past three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Many investors overlook these losses and pay more taxes than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

**Solution:** Keep track of your investment transactions and report losses in the year they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Even if you don't have gains this year, filing them for future use can be a valuable tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## 7. Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency

*   **Foreign Assets** If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets, including stocks, real estate, or offshore bank accounts, you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Failure to do so can result in significant penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency** Cryptocurrency is closely monitored by the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Unreported gains from selling or trading crypto can lead to a tax audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Some crypto exchanges now report transactions to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

**Solution:** Maintain detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Report all taxable gains and ensure compliance with tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## 8. Overlooking Income Splitting Opportunities

Income splitting can significantly reduce your household's overall tax burden, but many Canadians fail to utilize it due to its complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions** The higher-earning spouse can contribute to the lower-earning spouse's RRSP, leading to tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting** Retirees can split up to 50% of eligible pension income, lowering their combined tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **TFSA and FHSA** Accounts like the TFSA and FHSA are excellent for income splitting, as they are not subject to income attribution rules, allowing spouses or family members to contribute and grow investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## 9. Failing to Pay Installments If Required

If you owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec), the CRA may require you to make quarterly tax installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This often applies to self-employed individuals, landlords, investors, and high-income earners who don't have enough tax deducted at source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Consequences** Missing these payments can lead to interest charges and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The CRA charges compound daily interest on unpaid amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Additional Penalty** An additional penalty may apply if your installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This penalty is 50% of the amount by which your installment interest exceeds the greater of $1,000 or 25% of the installment interest you would have paid if no installments were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

**Solution:** Set reminders and budget accordingly for timely and sufficient installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This prevents unnecessary interest costs and large lump-sum tax bills in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## 10. Ignoring Tax Planning Until April

Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just something done when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunities** Many tax-saving strategies, such as contributing to an FHSA, making charitable donations, and capital loss harvesting, must be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Delay** Waiting until April means missing out on deductions and scrambling to organize documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Ongoing Planning** Business owners and investors should plan for capital gains, tax-efficient withdrawals, and income splitting throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

**Solution:** Set up a tax review before year-end to optimize your strategy, reduce your tax bill, and avoid last-minute surprises when filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Use Autofill My Return to Reduce Mistakes and Errors

The CRA provides a free tool called "Autofill My Return," built into NetFile certified tax software like TurboTax and Wealthsimple Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

**How it Works:**

1.  **Instantly Pull Tax Slips:** By logging into your My CRA account and connecting it to your tax software, Autofill will automatically import your T4s, T5s, RRSP contributions, and other tax slips directly from the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Prevents Audit Triggers:** One of the biggest mistakes people make is forgetting to report income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The CRA already possesses this information, so if anything is missed, they will detect it and may reassess your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Autofill ensures everything matches what the CRA expects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
3.  **Saves Time and Finds Missed Credits:** There's no need to scramble for paperwork or worry about typos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Autofill pulls the data for you and helps you find missed credits and claim every possible deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

**How to Use It:** Simply log into your My CRA account before filing, connect your tax software, and import your tax slips with one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This eliminates manual entry and helps avoid mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Tax mistakes can cost thousands, but they are entirely avoidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

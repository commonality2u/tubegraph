Tax season is not just about filing paperwork; it's about keeping more of your hard-earned money. Avoiding certain simple mistakes can prevent significant costs and ensure you maximize your deductions and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Top 10 Common Tax Filing Mistakes

### 1. Filing Late or Not Filing At All
Filing taxes late can be a very costly mistake, especially if you owe taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: If you owe taxes, the CRA charges a 5% penalty on the unpaid balance, plus an additional 1% per month until it's paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Repeated late filing can lead to increased penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Delayed Benefits**: Even if you don't owe taxes, filing late can delay refunds and benefits such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Set a reminder well before the April 30th deadline. If you expect to owe, file on time even if you can't pay immediately, to avoid penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### 2. Forgetting to Report All Income
The CRA has access to your T4s, T5s, and other income records, which they cross-check against your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Examples of Missed Income**: Employment income, rental income, side hustle earnings, and investment dividends are commonly overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Platform Reporting**: Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now report income directly to the CRA, and unreported earnings can trigger automatic reassessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: Failing to report $500 or more in income on your current return, especially if income was missed in any of the past three years, can result in a 10% penalty (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Ensure all income sources are accurately reported. Check your My CRA account to confirm all tax slips are included before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Keeping accurate records helps prevent costly surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### 3. Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs
Exceeding Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) or Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution limits can lead to penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: Excess RRSP contributions face a 1% monthly penalty until withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. TFSA contributions also incur a 1% monthly penalty on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Cause**: This often happens when taxpayers don't carefully track their contribution room or mistakenly assume the CRA will notify them of overcontributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Track your own contributions instead of solely relying on your My CRA account, as it may not be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If you overcontribute, withdraw the excess quickly to minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: You can exceed your RRSP limit by up to $2,000 without penalty, providing a small buffer, but this does not apply to TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 4. Missing Out on Deductions and Credits
Many Canadians overlook valuable tax deductions and credits that could reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Commonly Missed Deductions**: Medical expenses (prescription drugs, dental, travel for medical care), moving expenses for work or school, and union and professional membership dues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Student Credits**: Students often forget they can carry forward unused tuition credits or transfer them to a parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Review your eligibility for all possible deductions and credits. Always keep receipts and records, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### 5. Claiming Ineligible Write-Offs
The CRA is strict about business and employment deductions, and incorrect claims can lead to audits and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Home Office Expenses**: Deductible only if your workspace is your primary place of work or used exclusively for work-related activities. Eligible expenses include utilities, rent, and internet for the dedicated portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Business Expenses**: Deductions for items like meals, travel, and vehicle costs must be reasonable, directly related to earning income, and supported by receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Personal expenses disguised as business costs will be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Paying Family Members**: If you hire a spouse or child, their salary must reflect actual work performed; unjustified payments may be rejected and lead to reassessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 6. Forgetting to Claim Capital Losses
If you've sold investments (stocks, ETFs) or property at a loss, you can use these losses to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Carry Forward/Back**: The CRA allows you to carry forward capital losses indefinitely or apply them to gains from the past three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Keep track of investment transactions and report losses in the year they occur. Even without current gains, reporting losses for future use is a valuable tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### 7. Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency
Failure to report foreign assets and cryptocurrency can lead to significant penalties and audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Foreign Assets**: If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (stocks, real estate, offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency**: Unreported gains from selling or trading crypto can result in a tax audit. Some crypto exchanges now report transactions directly to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Maintain detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades, report all taxable gains, and follow correct tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### 8. Overlooking Income Splitting Opportunities
Income splitting can significantly reduce a household's overall tax burden, but many Canadians don't utilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions**: Allows a higher-earning spouse to contribute to a lower-earning spouse's RRSP for tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting**: Retirees can split up to 50% of eligible pension income to lower their combined tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **TFSA and FHSA**: These accounts are excellent for income splitting as they are not subject to income attribution rules, allowing spouses or family members to contribute and grow investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### 9. Failing to Pay Installments if Required
If you owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec), the CRA may require quarterly tax installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Who is Affected**: This often applies to self-employed individuals, landlords, investors, and high-income earners (e.g., commission salespeople) who don't have enough tax deducted at source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: Missing payments can lead to interest charges and penalties. The CRA charges compound daily interest on unpaid amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. An additional penalty may apply if your installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Set reminders and budget accordingly for timely and sufficient installment payments. This prevents unnecessary interest costs and large lump-sum tax bills in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 10. Ignoring Tax Planning Until April
Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just something done when you file your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Year-End Deadlines**: Many tax-saving strategies, such as contributing to a First Home Savings Account (FHSA), making charitable donations, and capital loss harvesting, must be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Early Planning**: Waiting until April means missing out on deductions and scrambling to organize documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Business owners and investors should plan for capital gains, tax-efficient withdrawals, and income splitting throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Set up a tax review before year-end to optimize your strategy, reduce your tax bill, and avoid last-minute surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

3.  **Saves Time and Finds Credits**: This feature eliminates the need to scramble for paperwork or worry about typos. It pulls data for you and helps identify missed credits and deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Tax season is not just about paperwork; it's about retaining more of your income. Avoiding certain common mistakes can prevent significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines 10 frequent tax filing errors and provides guidance on how to prevent them.

## 1. Filing Late or Not Filing at All

Filing your taxes past the deadline can be a costly error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Consequences:
*   **Penalties**: If you owe taxes, the CRA imposes a 5% penalty on the unpaid balance, plus an additional 1% per month until it's settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Delayed Benefits**: Even if no taxes are owed, late filing can delay tax refunds and benefits such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Increased Penalties**: Repeated late filing can result in higher penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Set reminders well before the April 30th deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   File on time even if you cannot pay immediately to prevent penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## 2. Forgetting to Report All Income

The CRA accesses your T4s, T5s, and other income records, cross-checking them against your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Consequences:
*   **Penalties and Audits**: Failing to report income from employment, rental properties, side hustles, or investment dividends can lead to penalties and potential audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Automatic Reassessment**: Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now report income directly to the CRA, which can trigger an automatic reassessment for unreported earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Unreported Income Penalty**: If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return and previously missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a 10% penalty on the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Ensure all income sources are accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Check your My CRA account to confirm all tax slips are included before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Keep accurate records of all income sources to prevent costly surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## 3. [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_mistakes | Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs]]

Exceeding your RRSP or TFSA contribution limit can result in penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Consequences:
*   **RRSP Penalty**: Excess RRSP contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty until withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **TFSA Penalty**: TFSA contributions incur a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Accumulating Penalties**: Penalties can quietly accumulate as the CRA does not always notify individuals of overcontributions immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Track your contributions carefully rather than relying solely on your My CRA account, as it is not always updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   If you overcontribute, withdraw the excess as soon as possible to minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: You are allowed to exceed your RRSP limit by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties, but this buffer does not apply to TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## 4. [[tax_deductions_and_credits_commonly_missed_by_canadians | Missing Out on Deductions and Credits]]

Many Canadians overlook valuable tax deductions and credits that can reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Commonly Missed:
*   **Medical Expenses**: Prescription drugs, dental treatments, and travel costs for medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Moving Expenses**: Deductible if you moved for work or school in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Union and Professional Membership Dues**: Can also be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Tuition Credits**: Students often forget they can carry forward unused tuition credits or transfer them to a parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Review your eligibility for all possible deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Keep receipts and records for all expenses, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## 5. Claiming Ineligible Write-Offs

The CRA is strict about business and employment deductions, and incorrect claims can lead to audits and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Examples of Ineligible Claims:
*   **Home Office Expenses**: Deductible only if your workspace is your primary place of work or used exclusively for work-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Eligible expenses include utilities, rent, and internet for that portion of your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Business Expense Write-Offs**: Deductions for meals, travel, and vehicle costs must be reasonable, directly related to earning income, and supported by receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Personal expenses disguised as business costs can be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Paying Family Members**: If you hire a spouse or child, their salary must reflect actual work performed; unjustified payments may be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## 6. Forgetting to Claim Capital Losses

If you've sold investments (like stocks or ETFs) or property at a loss, you can use these losses to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Rules for Capital Losses:
*   The CRA allows you to carry forward capital losses indefinitely or apply them to the past three years of gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Many investors overlook these losses, paying more taxes than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Keep track of your investment transactions and report losses in the year they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Even without current gains, filing losses for future use is a valuable tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## 7. Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency

Holding foreign assets above a certain threshold or having unreported cryptocurrency gains can lead to significant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Requirements:
*   **Foreign Assets**: If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (stocks, real estate, offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Failure to do so can lead to hefty penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency**: Unreported gains from selling or trading crypto can result in a tax audit, as some crypto exchanges now report transactions to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Many mistakenly believe crypto transactions remain anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Maintain detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Report all taxable gains and follow correct tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## 8. Overlooking Income Splitting Opportunities

[[strategies_to_avoid_tax_fraud_and_stay_compliant | Income splitting]] can significantly reduce a household's overall tax burden, but many Canadians don't utilize it due to its complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Common Strategies:
*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions**: Allows the higher-earning spouse to contribute to the lower-earning spouse's RRSP, leading to tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting**: Retirees can split up to 50% of eligible pension income to lower their combined tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **TFSA and FHSA**: These accounts are excellent for [[strategies_to_avoid_tax_fraud_and_stay_compliant | income splitting]] as they are not subject to income attribution rules, allowing family members to contribute and grow investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## 9. Failing to Pay Installments If Required

If you owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec), the CRA may require quarterly tax installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This often applies to self-employed individuals, landlords, investors, and high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Consequences:
*   **Interest Charges**: Missing payments can lead to interest charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The CRA charges compound daily interest on unpaid amounts based on the prescribed interest rate, which changes quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Additional Penalties**: An additional penalty may be incurred if your installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This penalty is 50% of the amount by which your installment interest exceeds the greater of $1,000 or 25% of the installment interest you would have paid if no installments were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Set reminders and budget accordingly to make timely and sufficient installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   A simple quarterly reminder on your calendar can help prevent missing payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## 10. Ignoring Tax Planning Until April

Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just something done when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### Importance of Year-Round Planning:
*   Many tax-saving strategies, such as contributing to a FHSA, making charitable donations, and capital loss harvesting, must be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Waiting until April means missing out on deductions and scrambling to organize documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Business owners and investors should plan for capital gains, tax-efficient withdrawals, and income splitting throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### How to Avoid:
*   Set up a tax review before year-end to optimize your strategy, reduce your tax bill, and avoid last-minute surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

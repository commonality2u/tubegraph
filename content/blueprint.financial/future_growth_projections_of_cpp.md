Despite concerns among 64% of Canadians that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) may not be available when they retire, the CPP is more secure than commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This optimism is based on several factors, including its impressive [[Investment performance of CPP | investment performance]], robust long-term projections, and the transparency of its reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Outperforming Expectations

The CPP fund has significantly outperformed its initial projections, contributing to its current strong financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   **Recent Performance** In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, CPP Investments reported a net income of $46.4 billion with an 8% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This pushed the fund's total assets to $632 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Exceeding Projections** Back in 2000, the CPP was expected to reach $425 billion by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Instead, it hit $632 billion in 2023, exceeding projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This growth demonstrates the success of smart [[Investment performance of CPP | investment strategies]] and resilience, even during challenging [[Economic implications of CPP changes | economic times]] such as the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Sustainability for Generations

The long-term sustainability of the CPP is a key concern, addressed through regular actuarial assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Actuarial Reports** Every three years, the Chief Actuary of Canada assesses the CPP's financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The latest [[Actuarial Studies and Reports on CPP | report]] confirms the CPP is on solid ground for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Projected Growth**
    *   By 2030, the fund is expected to reach approximately $1.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   By 2040, assets are projected to rise to nearly $2.5 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   By 2050, the fund is expected to reach an astounding $3.6 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Outlook** These forecasts highlight the [[Longterm sustainability of the CPP fund | long-term sustainability]] of the CPP, ensuring it can support current and future generations of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The fund is expected to remain financially stable and solvent well into the 22nd century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Trustworthiness of Reporting

The reliability of CPP's financial reports and projections is reinforced by multiple layers of independent oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Independent Oversight**
    *   **Chief Actuary of Canada:** Provides impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health, operating independently of political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The 31st [[Actuarial Studies and Reports on CPP | Actuarial report]] (2022) confirmed its 75-year sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   **Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO):** Reviews these reports, adding another layer of independent, nonpartisan scrutiny to ensure data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **External Audits:** External audits, such as Deloitte's 2022 audit, confirm that CPP Investments maintains effective internal control over financial reporting, further building trust in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. These multiple layers of scrutiny make CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Investment Performance and Management

The strategic [[Investment performance of CPP | investment performance]] and robust management of CPP Investments are crucial to its long-term success and ability to meet future projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Strong Long-Term Returns:** CPP Investments has delivered a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Diversified Global Portfolio:** The fund is globally diversified across 56 countries, investing in public and private equities, infrastructure, real estate, and fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Only 12% of the portfolio is invested in Canada, with the rest spread internationally to reduce concentration risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Active Management Strategy:** CPP Investments uses an active management approach, investing in areas like infrastructure, real estate, and private equity to outperform passive strategies over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. While this may lead to underperformance in some individual years (e.g., fiscal 2024's 8% net return compared to a 19.9% reference portfolio return), active management is essential for a pension fund like CPP to address the complexities of pension payouts and [[Actuarial Studies and Reports on CPP | actuarial needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The significant growth to $632 billion well above projections indicates sound [[Investment performance of CPP | investment management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

The CPP is projected to remain a reliable retirement backbone, supported by its strong financial health, rigorous oversight, and strategic investment management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

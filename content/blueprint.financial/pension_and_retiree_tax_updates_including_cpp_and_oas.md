The year 2025 brings several tax changes affecting pensions and retirees, aimed at maximizing tax savings and increasing retirement income [00:00:00]. These updates cover CPP contributions, OAS repayment thresholds, and age amount credits [00:07:29].

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Contributions

For 2025, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) introduces two levels of contributions with updated thresholds and rates [00:07:34]. These changes lead to higher contributions, which are designed to translate into larger future [[Retirement Strategies Integrating CPP | retirement benefits]] [00:08:45].

### Regular CPP (CPP1)
*   **Applicability** This level applies to income up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) [00:07:40].
*   **YMPE** The YMPE for 2025 is $71,200, an increase from $68,500 in 2024 [00:07:44].
*   **Basic Exemption** Contributions are calculated after a $3,500 basic exemption [00:07:48].
*   **Contribution Rate** The rate for regular CPP remains 5.95% for both employees and employers, resulting in an 11.9% combined contribution [00:08:04].

### Additional CPP (CPP2)
*   **Applicability** This second level applies to additional earnings between the YMPE and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) [00:07:52].
*   **YAMPE** The YAMPE for 2025 is $81,300 [00:07:57].
*   **Contribution Rate** The CPP2 rate is 4% for employees and employers, totaling 8% for self-employed individuals [00:08:12].

### Impact of Changes
*   **Lower Earners** Individuals earning below $71,200 will experience minimal or no changes to their CPP contributions [00:08:25].
*   **Higher Earners** Those earning up to $81,300 will see notable increases in their contributions due to the CPP2 [00:08:31]. For instance, someone earning $80,000 will contribute over $500 more to CPP in 2025 [00:08:39].
*   **Future Benefits** These higher contributions are an investment in future [[Retirement Strategies Integrating CPP | retirement income]] [00:08:52].

## Old Age Security (OAS) Repayment Threshold

For the 2024 income year, the Old Age Security (OAS) repayment threshold, also known as the "OAS clawback," is set at $90,995 [00:09:02].
*   **Repayment Rule** If your net income exceeds this threshold, you will need to repay part or all of your OAS pension through a recovery tax [00:09:11].
*   **Calculation** The repayment is calculated as 15% of the income exceeding the threshold [00:09:15].
*   **Recovery Period** The recovery tax period runs from July 2025 to June 2026, based on your 2024 income [00:09:21].
    *   _Example:_ If your net income for 2024 is $100,000, your excess income is approximately $9,000 ($100,000 - $90,995) [00:09:29]. The repayment amount would be 15% of that, or about $1,350, which will be deducted monthly from your OAS payments during the July 2025 to June 2026 period [00:09:39].

## Age Amount Credit

The age amount credit is a non-refundable tax credit for Canadians aged 65 and older, designed to reduce federal income tax [00:09:58].
*   **Maximum Amount** For the 2025 tax year, the maximum age amount is $9,928, an increase from $8,790 in 2024 [00:10:07].
*   **Eligibility** You are eligible for the full credit if your net income is below $45,522 [00:10:14].
*   **Reduction** The credit is reduced by 15% of net income exceeding this threshold [00:10:20].
*   **Elimination** The credit is fully eliminated when net income reaches approximately $100,000 [00:10:23].

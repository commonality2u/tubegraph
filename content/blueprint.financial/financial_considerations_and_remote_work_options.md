Many Canadians are considering leaving the country due to factors like high taxes, inflation, and harsh winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 2022, the number of Canadians moving to the U.S. alone reached 126,340 people, a 70% increase from 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. By 2016, an estimated 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad, a number likely higher today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Why Financial Considerations Drive Relocation

A primary motivation for Canadians to leave is the rising cost of living, particularly the skyrocketing housing prices in cities like Toronto and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Moving to countries such as Mexico, Portugal, or even some parts of the United States can significantly reduce living expenses, including housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Making Money Abroad: Remote Work and Other Options

Unless you possess significant wealth, securing a means of income is essential when living overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Three common paths for making money abroad are company transfers, remote work, and becoming a digital nomad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Expat Through Company Transfer
This path involves seeking international opportunities within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. Benefits include job security, maintained benefits, relocation assistance, and career advancement through international experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. However, it may offer less flexibility in location and work assignments, require adaptation to a new work culture, and usually demands a longer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### Remote Work
Remote work allows you to work from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating daily commutes and saving time and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Job opportunities can be found on websites like Remote.co, We Work Remotely, and FlexJobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Setting up a home office with reliable internet and essential tools is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. While common in software and IT, remote roles exist in HR, sales, and even law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Potential downsides include isolation, the need for high self-motivation and time management skills, and potentially less job security or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### Digital Nomad
Becoming a digital nomad involves developing a portable skill or service, such as freelance writing, graphic design, programming, or consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. A portfolio can be built on platforms like Behance or LinkedIn, and clients can be found on freelance websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. This lifestyle offers freedom to travel and experience new cultures, fostering personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Income can be unpredictable, balancing work and travel can be challenging, and navigating visas and work permits may be complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Digital nomads engage in diverse fields, including digital marketing, startup ownership, content creation, and even therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Canadian Non-Resident Financial Implications

To become a non-resident of Canada, you must sever significant residential ties, such as selling your home, closing bank accounts, and relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. The primary factor is where you spend your time, and documentation of your new residency is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

### Departure Tax
Be aware of the departure tax, which applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. You will need to pay tax on the unrealized gains of investments and real estate, though [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | RRSPs]], [[financial_considerations for starting cpp payments | RRIFs]], and certain real estate are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. These deemed dispositions must be reported on your final tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### TFSA, RSP, RRIF
Your TFSA can remain open but contributions are not permitted while you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Earnings within the TFSA will remain tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. While you can keep your [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | RRSP]] and [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | RRIF]] accounts open, withdrawals will be subject to a 25% withholding tax, which may be reduced by tax treaties with your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>.

### CPP and OAS
You can continue receiving [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | CPP]] payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. For OAS, you are eligible to receive payments outside Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. For a deep dive into these benefits, refer to specific resources on [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | financial considerations for starting CPP payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## Financial Planning in Your New Country

Understanding the financial rules of your new country is crucial for a smooth transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### Residency and Tax Laws
Research the residency requirements, including temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident and investigate tax treaties with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

### Banking
Learn how to open a local bank account by choosing a reputable bank and preparing necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Thoroughly understand the local currency, exchange rates, and banking system to ensure access to your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

### Citizenship by Investment
One pathway to citizenship involves investment programs where countries grant citizenship in exchange for significant financial investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. For example, Turkey offers citizenship for purchasing real estate worth at least $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>. This process requires the specified investment, proof of funds, and meeting any additional residency or legal requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

## Researching Cost of Living

A quick and dirty estimation of the cost of living in a new country can be done using tools like Numbeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This website allows you to compare the cost of living between two cities, providing a breakdown of various expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. For example, the cost of living in Mexico City is estimated to be 37% lower than in Toronto, with restaurant meals nearly 40% cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. While the data relies on user input, it tends to be accurate for popular cities and provides a good ballpark estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.

## Professional Advice
If you are seriously considering moving countries, it is highly recommended to consult a cross-border tax specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

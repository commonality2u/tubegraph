The traditional model of retiring at 65, which was effective when houses were affordable and life expectancy was shorter, is no longer sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Today, Canadians can live 30 or more years in retirement, necessitating a robust financial plan to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Increasingly, more Canadians are working past 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Evolving Retirement Landscape

Canadians are retiring later than in previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   In 1997, the average retirement age in Canada dipped to 60.9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   By 2010, it increased to 62.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   By 2020, it reached 64.3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   In 2024, the average retirement age has climbed to 65.3, the highest in nearly half a centuryâ€”a four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees leave the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. About 12% worked by choice to stay active and fulfilled, while 9% worked out of [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | financial necessity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This indicates a rethinking of what retirement looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Retirement ages also vary by employment sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:
*   Public sector employees tend to retire around 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Private sector workers retire around 65.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Self-employed Canadians retire latest, averaging nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Reasons for Changes in Retirement Funding and Timing

Several [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | factors]] contribute to Canadians working longer and delaying retirement.

### 1. Longer Life Expectancy
Canadians are living longer than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, if a man makes it to 60, his life expectancy is about 80.5 years, and for a woman, it's 85 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Being healthy at 65 suggests two or more decades of life ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means retirement is no longer a 10-year plan but a 20- to 30-year lifestyle that requires more funding and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This directly relates to the [[impact_of_longer_life_expectancy_on_retirement_planning | impact of longer life expectancy on retirement planning]].

### 2. Changes in Pension Coverage
For a long time, many Canadians relied on defined benefit pensions, offering a predictable income for life backed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, this type of pension is becoming less common, especially in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Instead, private sector workers are more likely to have defined contribution plans, where retirement income depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The majority of Canadians must rely on personal savings like RRSPs and TFSAs for their retirement funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Thus, retirement funding has become more "DIY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without a matching boost in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Shelter costs** were up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Food prices** have increased by over 20% since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Healthcare costs**, while public healthcare is available, out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

These rising expenses make it harder to make ends meet for those living off [[pension_and_retiree_tax_changes_including_cpp_and_oas | CPP]], OAS, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 4. Less Physical Work
Many jobs are now knowledge-based or service-oriented, involving less physical strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job is not physically demanding and one remains mentally sharp, there is less incentive to stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Work provides structure, identity, and social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
For many, retirement is seen less as an escape and more as an opportunity for freedom, which can include part-time consulting, teaching, or freelance work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Retirement is often viewed as a gradual transition rather than a hard stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" is increasingly common, leading to significant financial resets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Asset division, legal fees, and the need to support two households instead of one can derail existing retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Many individuals experiencing late-life breakups delay retirement or re-enter the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### 7. Uncertainty
Market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation contribute to a sense of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tensions also add to general anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Many Canadians delay retirement not out of necessity, but to achieve a sense of financial safety and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Working a few more years can create a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Case Study: Optimizing Retirement Funding

Consider Keanu, a single 65-year-old aiming for a modest lifestyle of $50,000 per year in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He earned $90,000 annually before retirement, has $400,000 in his RRSP and $100,000 in his TFSA, and a paid-off home but no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | CPP]] and OAS are assumed to start at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | case study of retirement spending patterns]] demonstrates how small changes can significantly impact funding longevity.

### Scenario 1: Retiring at 65
If Keanu retires at 65, starts collecting CPP and OAS immediately, and lives off his savings, he runs out of money by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His RRSP depletes quickly, and his TFSA cannot cover the remaining years, leading to a negative net worth by his mid-80s, without accounting for unexpected health or inflation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. A $500,000 saving may not be enough for over 25 years of retirement without a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Working Three More Years
If Keanu works three more years (to age 68) earning $90,000 annually and continues saving, while still taking CPP and OAS at 65, his money easily lasts through age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He finishes with a net estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Just three additional years of work provide over a decade of financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Working Two More Years and Delaying CPP
If Keanu works two more years (to age 67) but delays taking CPP until 70 to lock in a much higher monthly benefit, he still faces a shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He aggressively dips into his RRSP between 67 and 69 to bridge the gap, which drains it too quickly, leaving less for his later years despite stronger CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Delaying CPP is powerful, but without a smart withdrawal strategy, it can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP, and Strategic RRSP Withdrawals
In a more strategic approach, Keanu retires at 67, delays CPP to 70, but draws gradually from his RRSP between 67 and 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. He takes just enough to cover his needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This strategy results in a steady income throughout retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate of over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This combination of working two more years, delaying CPP, and strategic RRSP withdrawals provides the necessary balance for his [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

This example highlights that by tweaking a few levers, such as the timing of [[pension_and_retiree_tax_changes_including_cpp_and_oas | CPP]] and OAS payments, smart withdrawal strategies, and working a bit longer, individuals can build a viable retirement plan without needing to double their savings or work until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

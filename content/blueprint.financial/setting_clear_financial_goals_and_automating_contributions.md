Setting clear financial goals provides purpose and direction to your financial plan, acting as a blueprint to help you prioritize and stay on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. [[automation_strategies_for_effortless_saving | Automation]] ensures consistent progress by removing the need for constant decision-making, reducing procrastination and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## How to Set and Automate Financial Goals

1.  **Define your Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>
    Make your [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | financial goals]] specific and measurable for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Paying off $6,000 in credit card debt by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
    *   Saving $5,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    *   Building a $15,000 emergency fund (equivalent to 6 months of expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Contributing the full $7,000 [[importance_of_having_a_clear_tfsa_strategy | TFSA]] limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Contributing a portion to your [[prioritizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | RSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

2.  **Break Goals into Milestones** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>
    Instead of a large annual goal, break it down into smaller, manageable milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   For a $12,000 vacation savings goal, aim for $1,000 per month or $250 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   For $6,000 in debt repayment, target $500 monthly or $125 weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
    *   Celebrate your wins to stay motivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

3.  **Automate Your Contributions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
    *   **Savings:** Set automatic transfers to a high-interest savings account or [[importance_of_having_a_clear_tfsa_strategy | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   **Investments:** Use pre-authorized [[contribution_strategies_for_investments | contributions]] for [[prioritizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | RSPs]], FHSAs, or other accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   **Debt Repayment:** Schedule payments to reduce balances and avoid late fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip: Schedule [[impact_of_regular_contributions_on_savings_growth | contributions]] right after payday to prioritize savings and avoid spending the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

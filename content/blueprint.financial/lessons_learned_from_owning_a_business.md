The founder of wealthawesome.com, a Canadian personal finance website, shares the journey of starting, growing, and eventually selling the business, along with key lessons learned along the way.

## The Genesis of Wealth Awesome

Wealth Awesome was launched in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> with initial financial goals of earning $3,000 per month and attracting 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These goals were significantly exceeded, almost tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

The primary motivations for starting the site included:
*   **Aspiration to be a Digital Nomad:** The desire for location independence and the ability to travel while working remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The founder had previous experience backpacking in Asia and sought to build a life with that freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Creating Positive Impact:** A wish to build something that would be a "net positive" by educating Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> and providing a sense of purpose and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Skills:** The founder was already writing for Canadian media and investment publications like CTV News on finance-related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, and a friend suggested starting their own financial education site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Recognizing an opportunity to create high-quality content given existing expertise in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, the decision was made to launch the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## The Decision to Sell

The site was sold for several reasons:
*   **Loss of Passion:** After years, the founder began to lose the "fire" and motivation to produce content, indicating it was time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

*   **Opportunity with a Trusted Acquaintance:** The site was eventually sold to a good friend, Q, a former colleague from CI Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Q was building a portfolio of digital assets and was seen as a trustworthy person with fresh ideas to grow the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## The Next Chapter: Blueprint Financial

The founder is now starting a new business, Blueprint Financial, a [[transitioning_from_blogging_to_a_financial_planning_company | financial planning company]] that builds customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This new venture aligns with values and skills, stemming from a belief that most people haven't optimized their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The founder's favorite corporate job was as a financial advisor due to the intimate one-on-one connection and personal satisfaction it provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The experience of owning Wealth Awesome allowed the founder to live a digital nomad lifestyle, traveling to many countries including Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bali, Mexico, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, and to make a significant impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

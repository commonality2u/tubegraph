Setting up a trust can be a powerful [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | tax planning]] tool for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Trusts can be used to:

*   Minimize taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   Protect assets from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

There are several types of trusts, including family trusts and corporate trusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### Common Trust Strategies
*   **Family Trust for Income Splitting**: A common strategy is to set up a [[advanced_retirement_tax_strategies_with_ipps_and_family_trusts | Family Trust]] to split income among family members in lower tax brackets, thereby reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This is one of the [[examples_of_family_and_retirement_tax_stacking_strategies | family tax stacking strategies]] mentioned.
*   **Trust within a Corporation**: Another strategy involves using a trust within a corporation to hold shares, which can provide significant tax advantages upon the sale of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

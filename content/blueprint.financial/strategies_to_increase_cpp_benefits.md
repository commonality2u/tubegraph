Many Canadians receive significantly less than the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average recipient getting 40% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding the factors that influence your CPP benefits and applying specific [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | strategies to maximize CPP payouts]] can help you get closer to the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Average vs. Maximum CPP Payouts (2024)

Not everyone receives the same CPP amount at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payout amount varies significantly based on when you start receiving your pension:

*   **Age 65 (Standard Age):**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
    *   Average monthly amount (as of April 2024): $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>
    *   The average amount is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Age 60 (Early Start):**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>
    *   Average monthly amount: $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **Age 70 (Delayed Start):**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   Average monthly amount: $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah

David and Sarah are both 65 years old and receiving CPP, but with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **David:** Started his CPP at age 60 and receives an average amount of $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Sarah:** Started her CPP at age 65 and receives the maximum payout of $1,364 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Factors Determining CPP Payouts

The difference in CPP payouts, as seen with David and Sarah, is due to several key [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | factors that affect CPP payout amounts]]:

### Contributions

Your CPP retirement pension heavily depends on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to:
*   Contribute for at least 39 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Average Earnings

Your average earnings over your career also affect your CPP amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Higher average earnings** throughout your career lead to higher CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Consistently high annual earnings** that meet or exceed the YMPE will maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Gaps in earnings** or years with lower earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### David and Sarah Revisited

Applying these factors to David and Sarah:
*   **Contribution Period:** Sarah contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period. David had employment gaps and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Earnings History:** Sarah consistently earned at or above the YMPE. David had many years of much lower earnings, reducing his overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Consistent Contributions:** Sarah ensured her earnings met or exceeded the YMPE annually. David's inconsistent contributions due to career changes and lower-paying jobs meant he didn't reach the same total contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

> [!TIP] Key Takeaway: The more you earn and contribute to CPP from your paycheck, the higher your CPP benefits will eventually be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Strategies to Increase CPP Payments

Here are several [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | strategies to maximize CPP payouts]] and move from average to maximum CPP payments:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP

If you continue working while receiving CPP (up to age 70), you can still contribute to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These additional contributions earn you a Post-Retirement Benefit, which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Example:** Sarah, at 67, still works part-time while receiving CPP. Her continued contributions increase her monthly CPP payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 2. Drop Out Lower Income Years

The CPP includes provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings from your calculation, which can result in a higher average earnings calculation:
*   **General Dropout Provision:** Allows you to drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This equals about 8 years if you've contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This is helpful for periods with lower income, such as when starting a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Dropout:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower-earning years from your CPP calculation, increasing your benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions:** Periods of disability can also adjust your lower-earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### 3. Max Out Earnings and Contributions

Aim for your annual income to meet or exceed the YMPE, which is $68,500 for 2024 (this amount increases annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Suggestions to achieve this:
*   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Alex started a successful online business, and the extra income from his side hustle helped him exceed the YMPE, increasing his CPP contributions and future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career. The more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP, and the higher your future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Contributions:** Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistently high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Your CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings will result in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Methods to Estimate CPP Benefits

To know if you're on track to receive the maximum CPP, you can use these [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits | methods to estimate CPP benefits]]:

### 1. Rule of Thumb

CPP has been enhanced to replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Previously, it replaced 25% of average work earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Example:** If your average annual earnings were $40,000, under the new enhancement, CPP could replace about one-third, providing approximately $13,332 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   This method is best used as a ballpark estimate as calculations can be tricky due to yearly variations and maximum limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### 2. Using Calculators

For a more tailored estimate, online calculators are available:
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** Comprehensive and provides a detailed estimate of your future CPP payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It can take about 30 minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier option, though less accurate the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Your Statement of Contributions

This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Online via My Service Canada Account:** Sign in (or register if you don't have an account), select "CPP OAS," and scroll to the contribution section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated monthly benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **By Phone:** You can call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **[[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | Delaying CPP start age]] vs. Maximizing Payouts:** While [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp | delaying CPP]] significantly increases your payout, it's distinct from boosting your payout from average to maximum. The factors discussed above (contributions, earnings) are what primarily move you from average to maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement at Age 60:** Some believe starting CPP at 60 helps avoid "penalties" for having no income between 60 and 65. However, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. As a general rule, it's often better to [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delay CPP]] as long as possible, even if you're not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Optimizing your CPP payouts requires understanding how your contributions and earnings history impact your benefits.

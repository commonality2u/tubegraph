The traditional notion of retiring at 65, which worked when most people didn't live past 75, is no longer viable today, as individuals can live 30 or more years in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This significant increase in life expectancy has a profound [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | impact]] on [[financial_planning_for_retirees | retirement planning]], necessitating a different approach to ensure financial security throughout an extended retirement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Current Trends in Longevity

Canadians are living longer than in the past, a positive development with a considerable [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | impact]] on retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy is not fixed; it increases the older an individual gets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is because by reaching an older age, many "life's random risks or high-risk activities" have already been outlived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Specific life expectancy projections for Canadians include:
*   **At age 40:** An average Canadian man can expect to live to 78, and women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **At age 50:** Men are projected to live to 79, and women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **At age 60:** Men are looking at approximately an 80.5-year life expectancy, and women at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **At age 70:** Men reach about an 83.2-year life expectancy, and women at 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

If an individual is healthy and reaches 65, they can likely expect two or more additional decades of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Implications for Retirement Duration

Retirement is no longer a 10-year plan; it has evolved into a "20 to 30-year lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This means:
*   **More years to fund:** An extended retirement requires more savings and a longer period of income replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **More health to manage:** Increased longevity also implies a greater need to consider healthcare costs, which tend to rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Public healthcare does not cover all expenses, with costs for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions often being out-of-pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **More time for personal fulfillment:** Retirees have more time to determine what they want to do with their lives once work is no longer the central focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Consequences for Financial Security

Without a proper [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial plan]], an individual might run out of money during an extended retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For example, a single retiree with $500,000 in savings, aiming for a modest $50,000 annual lifestyle, could run out of money by age 83 if retiring at 65 and immediately drawing from savings and standard CPP/OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This demonstrates that even a seemingly substantial amount of savings may be insufficient over 25 years without a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

The increased lifespan is a primary reason why more Canadians are [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | working longer]] and retiring later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The average retirement age in Canada has steadily increased, reaching 65.3 years in 2024, the highest in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This is a full four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[financial_planning_for_retirees | Financial Planning]] Considerations

To mitigate the risk of outliving savings due to increased longevity, several [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_single_retirees | strategies]] are crucial:
*   **Extended Working Years:** Working just a few extra years can significantly improve financial stability in retirement. For instance, working three more years can provide over a decade of financial breathing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Strategic CPP/OAS Timing:** While delaying CPP to age 70 yields a higher monthly benefit, it requires a smart withdrawal strategy from other savings to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Without this, aggressive withdrawals can deplete funds too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Gradual RRSP Withdrawals:** Drawing gradually from RRSPs to cover needs while keeping taxes low, combined with working longer and delaying CPP, can provide a steady income, lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive [[financial_planning_for_retirees | Planning]]:** A comprehensive [[the_importance_of_personalized_retirement_planning | retirement plan]] considers multiple "moving parts," including taxes, OAS clawback, draw down [[strategies_for_maximizing_retirement_income | strategies]], inflation, [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | health costs]], and estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The right sequencing of payments and withdrawals can be very powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The goal of [[financial_planning_for_retirees | retirement planning]] in the context of longer life expectancies is to buy back time and enjoy more healthy years, allowing retirees to live and not just worry about surviving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

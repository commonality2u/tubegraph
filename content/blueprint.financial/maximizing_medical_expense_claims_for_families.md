Navigating medical expenses in Canada can be complex, even with public healthcare, but the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides opportunities to [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_canada | claim some costs]] on your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Understanding how to utilize the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) is key to [[strategies_for_stacking_tax_credits_and_maximizing_tax_refunds | maximizing your refund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Understanding the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC)

The [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_canada | Medical Expense Tax Credit]] allows Canadians to [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

To claim it, expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Claim Calculation Details
You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. From the total eligible amount, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

**Example: Jessica**
*   Income: $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   Medical Expenses (2024): $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   3% of income: $1,500 ($50,000 * 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Eligible Claim: $2,500 - $1,500 = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, which reduces her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Claimable Medical Expenses

While the article focuses on families, it's important to understand the types of expenses that qualify:

*   **Prescribed Drugs and Medications**: Must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This can include medical marijuana with a valid medical document and purchase from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements are generally not covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Dental and Vision Care**: Eligible expenses for services by licensed professionals such as dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This includes routine checkups, fillings, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   **Pro Tip for [[strategies_for_highincome_earners_to_utilize_medical_expense_deductions | High-Income Earners]]**: Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **[[guidelines_for_claiming_medical_travel_expenses_and_private_insurance_premiums | Medical Travel Expenses]]**: If you travel at least 40 km one way for medical services not available near your home, you can claim travel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   **Pro Tip**: If a medical practitioner certifies the need for assistance, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **[[guidelines_for_claiming_medical_travel_expenses_and_private_insurance_premiums | Private Health Insurance Premiums]]**: Premiums paid out-of-pocket for private health insurance covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization may be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Medical Devices and Equipment**: Costly items such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, and orthopaedic braces often qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts can also be eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Some devices require a doctor's prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

For families, properly [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claiming medical expenses]] can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, but choosing who claims them is crucial for maximizing savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Strategic Claiming for Couples and Dependents

Consider Richard and Pauline, a Canadian couple with two children, and their medical expenses:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen (16 years old): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Rob (19 years old): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   Total Family Expenses: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

**Combining Expenses for Claim Lines:**
*   Jen's expenses (under 18) are combined with Richard's and Pauline's on Line 33099, totaling $6,300 ($2,500 + $2,000 + $1,800) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Rob's expenses (adult dependent) must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

**Determining Who Should Claim (Line 33099):**
The individual with the lower net income will often yield a larger deduction for the family's combined medical expenses due to the 3% net income threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Pauline's Scenario**:
    *   Income: $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
    *   3% of income: $1,650 ($55,000 * 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
    *   Eligible Claim: $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

*   **Richard's Scenario**:
    *   Income: $42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>
    *   3% of income: $1,260 ($42,000 * 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>
    *   Eligible Claim: $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

Since Richard's eligible claim of $5,040 is higher than Pauline's $4,650, Richard should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

In Canada, while healthcare is supposedly free, out-of-pocket medical expenses can still be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows you to claim some of these costs on your tax return, helping you keep more of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide will walk you through how medical expense claims work in Canada and offer smart ways to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize your refund]], especially for families.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work in Canada

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) allows Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. To claim it, you must enter medical expenses on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:

*   **Line 33099**: For expenses for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For other dependents like adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($50,000) is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (expenses) - $1,500 (3% of income) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
> Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, reducing her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Eligible Medical Expenses for Tax Credits

Here are five common [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] you might not know you can claim:

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

Prescribed drugs and medications can be a significant expense, and you may be able to recoup some of these costs at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The CRA allows you to claim eligible prescription drugs and medications as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. They must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Medical marijuana is also covered under certain conditions: you need a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and must purchase it from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements generally do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spends $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($60,000) is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $3,000 (expenses) - $1,800 (3% of income) = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
> Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses on her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> Keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize your claim]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Dental and vision expenses can add up quickly, but many of these costs are tax deductible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. You can claim eligible expenses for services provided by licensed professionals, including dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Covered expenses include routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Alex earns $150,000 annually and spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
>
> *   3% of his income ($150,000) is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
> *   The set threshold amount for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
> *   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 from his total medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
> *   He can claim $3,100 (expenses) - $2,759 (threshold) = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> Higher-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]], such as getting laser eye surgery and a root canal in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Medical Travel Expenses and Tax Deductions

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to [[medical_travel_expenses_and_tax_deductions | claim your travel costs as a medical expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Eligible travel expenses include:
*   Public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
*   Vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
*   Lodging (hotel, Airbnb) and meals when required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. She spends $800 on gas and parking, and $1,500 on meals and accommodations, for a total of $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,300 (expenses) - $1,650 (3% of income) = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
> Jennifer can claim $650 of expenses on her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanied person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Always keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This includes plans that cover medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed as long as they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children, which can help [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
>
> *   3% of his income ($90,000) is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,500 (premiums) - $2,700 (3% of income) = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
> Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, verify which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Medical devices and equipment can be costly, but many qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. You can claim items such as wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces, and in some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Some medical devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify, so it's essential to keep a record of both the prescription and the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. If the device requires ongoing maintenance (e.g., batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters), these costs may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Emily earns $65,000 and buys a CPAP machine for her sleep apnea, which costs $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
>
> *   3% of her income ($65,000) is $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (machine cost) - $1,950 (3% of income) = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
> Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> While this amount may seem small, combining it with other medical expenses could [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | increase her total deduction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Before making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it's on the CRA's list of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible medical devices]] to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

If you have a family, properly [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claiming medical expenses]] can make a big difference in your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Knowing who should claim them can significantly impact your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Richard and Pauline are a Canadian couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Their medical expenses were:
>
> *   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
> *   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
> *   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
> *   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
> *   **Total**: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>
>
> Since Jen is under 18, her expenses ($1,800) are combined with Richard's ($2,500) and Pauline's ($2,000), making $6,300 eligible for line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
>
> Let's [[calculation_of_medical_expense_tax_credits | calculate their eligible claims]]:
> *   **Pauline (Income: $55,000)**:
>     *   3% of her income: $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>
>     *   Eligible claim for line 33099: $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
> *   **Richard (Income: $42,000)**:
>     *   3% of his income: $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
>     *   Eligible claim for line 33099: $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
>
> Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount for expenses on line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Rob's expenses of $1,300 would be claimed on line 33199.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. They may get a bigger deduction because the 3% of net income threshold will be lower, resulting in a higher eligible claim. By organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim, you can [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize tax savings]] when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

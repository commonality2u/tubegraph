[[introduction_to_income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is an advanced strategy that can significantly help couples reduce their tax burden and save money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## FHSA for Income Splitting

While primarily for saving for a home, the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) can also help couples save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

*   **Who it's for:** Couples where one partner has maximized their tax-advantaged accounts (like an RRSP, TFSA, or FHSA) and the other has unused FHSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **How it works:** The higher-income partner can gift money to the lower-income partner, who then contributes it to their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This allows the couple to avoid investing in a taxable account, claim a tax deduction, and enjoy tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Example:** Jim gives $8,000 to Pam, who hasn't used her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Pam receives a $2,400 tax deduction, avoids $132 in taxes on growth, and all future growth is tax-free, saving the couple a total of $2,532 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Spousal RRSP Contributions

[[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | Spousal RRSPs]] are designed to balance retirement incomes and [[income_splitting_to_reduce_tax_burden | reduce taxes]] for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

*   **How it works:** The higher-income spouse contributes to the lower-income spouse's RRSP, receiving an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. In retirement, the lower-income spouse withdraws the funds at their typically lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Example:** Jim contributes $12,000 to Pam's RRSP, which lowers Jim's taxes by $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. When Pam withdraws the funds in retirement, she pays only $2,400 in taxes, saving the couple $1,800 overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Splitting Capital Losses

You can turn investment losses into tax savings by transferring capital losses between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **Example:** Jim's $4,000 capital loss can reduce Pam's $15,000 in capital gains, saving the couple $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Capital losses can only be split between spouses in non-registered accounts, and the buyer must hold the shares for at least 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

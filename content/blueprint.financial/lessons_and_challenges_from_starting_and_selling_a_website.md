The website WealthAwesome.com was launched in 2019 with an initial financial goal of earning $3,000 per month and attracting 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These goals were significantly exceeded, with monthly earnings becoming nearly ten times the original target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article details the journey from starting the site to its eventual sale, including the motivations, earnings, growth, lessons learned, and reasons for selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Motivation for Starting WealthAwesome.com

Several key factors inspired the creation of WealthAwesome.com:

*   **Dream of a Digital Nomad Lifestyle** The founder harbored a long-standing dream of becoming a digital nomad, working remotely while traveling the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite having great jobs in finance and energy in Alberta and Vancouver, a desire to see more of the world and the freedom to work anywhere as an independent boss persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Desire for Positive Impact** A strong motivation was to create something that would be a "net positive" in the world, specifically by helping to educate Canadians and providing a sense of purpose and joy through assisting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Existing Writing Experience** The founder had already been writing for Canadian media and investment publications, including CTV News, for finance-related topics, accumulating tens of thousands of readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A friend suggested starting a personal finance education site, leading to the realization that the quality of existing Canadian financial blogs could be matched or exceeded, given the founder's education and experience in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Love for Writing and Market Opportunity** Identifying an opportunity to provide excellent content and share the digital nomad journey, coupled with a genuine love for writing, solidified the decision to launch the site in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Financial Success of WealthAwesome.com

[[income_streams_from_blogging_and_affiliate_marketing | Income streams from blogging and affiliate marketing]] were a key aspect of WealthAwesome.com's success.

### Earnings and Growth
Generating income from the blog was not immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The first $50 affiliate commission from Questrade was earned in November 2020, about a year after the site's launch and after writing over 150 articles and spending hundreds of hours on the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This initial earning, despite the effort, served as a crucial validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The income then rapidly grew, with the initial goal of $3,000 per month achieved in February 2021, approximately a year and a half after launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. At its peak, monthly earnings exceeded $20,000, almost reaching $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In total, the website generated over $500,000 in income, not including the confidential sale price of the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Income Streams
Income was primarily generated through:

*   **Advertising**
    *   Once a site reaches a certain traffic threshold, it can apply for premium ad networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
    *   WealthAwesome.com joined Mediavine after reaching 50,000 visitors per month (the requirement has since been lowered to 10,000 visitors/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   Ad networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille or per 1,000 visitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For finance content with Mediavine, RPMs were very high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors, meaning 10,000 visitors could generate around $500 USD (or nearly $700 CAD) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions**
    *   Earnings are generated by recommending and referring products, but only those genuinely believed in and personally used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   Top affiliate partners included Well Simple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   For example, an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms included affiliate links, generating commissions of $50-$100 (some even $150-$200) when users signed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This created a win-win situation where users found great products and the site earned revenue for trusted referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Website Traffic Growth

The site's traffic started very slowly, gaining significant traction only after about 11 months and 100 articles, reaching around 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Traffic then rapidly accelerated, increasing tenfold to 50,000 visitors per month by January 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The site peaked at approximately 250,000 visitors per month in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Over its operational years, WealthAwesome.com accumulated around 5 million visitors, a substantial number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Additionally, a linked YouTube channel grew to almost 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The experience of starting and growing WealthAwesome.com provided numerous invaluable lessons:

### Technical and Business Skills

*   **SEO and Content Creation**: Acquired skills in Search Engine Optimization (SEO), writing, and graphic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Data Analysis**: Learned to analyze website data effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

*   **Team Management**: Learned how to hire and manage people, and utilize various online tools for business operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Leveraging Past Experience
Previous professional roles significantly contributed to the site's growth:
*   **Analyst**: Helped in analyzing SEO and outreach data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Business-to-Business Sales**: Aided in promoting the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Financial Advisor**: Instrumental in writing useful content and connecting deeply with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Personal Growth and Business Management
This was the founder's first significant business, leading to crucial personal and entrepreneurial development:
*   **Managing Challenges**: Learned to manage the inherent challenges and ups and downs of running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Mental Toughness**: Developed mental toughness to ride out bad results and persist, recognizing that problems will always arise and cannot all be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This was identified as perhaps the most important lesson learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Accepting Uncontrollable Factors**: Realized that timing and luck play a significant role. The site's launch just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending more time online and interested in personal finance, was a fortunate coincidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Controlling Reactions**: Understood that while one cannot control everything, one can control how they react to circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling the Site

The decision to sell WealthAwesome.com was multifaceted:

*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the founder began to lose passion for the daily operations, finding it increasingly difficult to motivate and produce amazing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. A key lesson learned was to recognize when the "fire" is gone and it's time to move on, noting that the site was likely held onto for a year longer than it should have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of Blogging's Future**: There was significant uncertainty about the long-term direction of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, which caused considerable stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Desire for Diversification**: A wish to diversify away from the blogging business was a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Opportunity to Sell to a Trusted Friend**: The sale occurred serendipitously when a good friend and former colleague, Q, who was building a portfolio of digital assets, reached out to inquire about purchasing the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The sale to a trusted and highly intelligent friend ensured the site would be managed with fresh ideas in a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Current Ventures

Post-sale, the founder embarked on [[postblogging_ventures_in_financial_planning | postblogging ventures in financial planning]]. A new business, Blueprint Financial, a financial planning company, has been started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This venture aligns perfectly with personal values and skills, aiming to build customized financial plans for Canadians who may not have optimized their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

The decision to start Blueprint Financial was influenced by experienced business partners and the immense value observed after testing financial plans personally and with family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The role offers personal satisfaction, similar to a previous favorite job as a financial advisor, due to the intimate one-on-one connections with individuals and families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The founder also plans to continue providing valuable free personal finance content on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

The entire experience with WealthAwesome.com has been overwhelmingly positive, leading to extensive travel and living in numerous countries including Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bali, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines, the US, Canada, and Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This journey has allowed for meeting diverse people and making a real impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Income in Canada can vary significantly based on the province of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This variation is influenced by factors such as provincial economies and job markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Data from 2022 highlights these [[regional_variations_in_rrsp_savings_in_canada | regional variations]] in average and median incomes across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

    *   Median Income: $45,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
    *   This is attributed to its robust energy and resource sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Alberta also leads with the highest average income at $61,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Its combination of high wages and lower living costs can allow for greater savings and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Strategic Relocation for Income Growth

If flexibility in living location is possible, relocating to a province with higher wages and a lower cost of living can substantially increase disposable income and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Alberta is highlighted as a prime example, offering a combination of high average income and lower living costs conducive to wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

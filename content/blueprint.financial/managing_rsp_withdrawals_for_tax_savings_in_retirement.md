Many Canadian retirees can significantly reduce their tax burden by strategically managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A common error is not properly managing [[importance_of_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RSP withdrawals]], which leaves money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By implementing a smart RSP to TFSA tactic, individuals can reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and keep more of their money for a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue for retirees is the underutilization of their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Statistics show that out of 17.77 million Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions, indicating a vast majority miss out on tax-free growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% maximize contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before dropping slightly to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This surge in TFSA maximization among older retirees can be explained by the strategy discussed below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

While RSPs are excellent for saving during working years, they come with [[rrsp_inflexibility_and_withdrawal_tax_consequences | strings attached]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Every dollar withdrawn from an RSP is taxed as income, potentially pushing retirees into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Furthermore, at age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates converting RSPs into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) and starting mandatory withdrawals, regardless of whether the funds are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

The core of this [[taxefficient_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | strategy]] is simple: if you don't need the money from your mandatory RSP or RRIF withdrawals, contribute any excess funds into your TFSA and invest it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can save thousands in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, a 71-year-old who has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In his 30% tax bracket, this means $9,000 in taxes, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 of this amount for his living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead of putting this excess into a normal savings or taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually to his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Assuming a 6% average annual growth rate:

*   **TFSA Growth:**
    *   After 1 year: $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
    *   After 10 years (with $10,000 annual contributions): $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account (for comparison):**
    *   If Eddie invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, growing at 6%, but with 30% of gains lost to taxes each year (effective 4% growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   After 10 years: approximately $120,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Taxable Savings Account (for comparison):**
    *   If the money was placed in a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the balance would be much lower, estimated around $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

By contributing his excess RRIF income to his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Achieves a TFSA balance of $132,000, significantly more than the $120,000 in a non-registered account or ~$55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Maximizes his retirement savings and gains flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Pro Tips
*   Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Does This Strategy Eliminate RSP Taxes on Withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals will still be considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

However, by [[balancing_rsp_and_tfsa_withdrawals_to_minimize_taxes | strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions]], you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties like OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The objective is to minimize the tax impact while maximizing your overall retirement income, ensuring your savings work for you, not the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Retirees in Canada can utilize various tax credits to reduce their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These credits, ranging from basic, automatically applied amounts to those requiring specific income types, can help keep more money for personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Consider Margery, a 67-year-old Canadian earning $40,000 annually from her pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. With this income, she is in a combined 20% federal and provincial tax bracket in Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The following credits significantly impact her tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Basic Tax Credits for Retirees

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

Every Canadian can earn $15,000 tax-free thanks to the Basic Personal Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This credit is automatically applied when filing taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For Margery, her first $15,000 of income is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, resulting in a $3,000 tax saving at her 20% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Age Amount Credit

Once a Canadian turns 65, they become eligible for the Age Amount Credit, which provides additional tax relief for seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Margery, being 67, qualifies for an additional $8,790 tax exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This credit saves her an additional $1,758 at her 20% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> and is also automatically applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

It's important to note that the Age Amount Credit begins to phase out for higher income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In 2024, if a retiree's income exceeds $42,335, the credit starts to reduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, phasing out entirely at around $113,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Since Margery's income is $40,000, she qualifies for the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Pension Income Amount Credit

The Pension Income Amount Credit allows retirees to claim up to $2,000 of eligible pension income tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This includes income from a Registered Income Fund (RRIF) or an employer pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This credit adds $400 in tax savings for Margery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip**: This credit does not apply to Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. To benefit, Margery needs to apply it to other pension income, such as from a RRIF or a private pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Retirees can claim this credit by reporting eligible pension income on line 31400 of their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Total Tax Savings Example (Margery)

By utilizing these three basic tax credits, Margery achieves significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>:

*   **Basic Personal Amount**: $3,000 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   **Age Amount Credit**: $1,758 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **Pension Income Amount Credit**: $400 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

In total, these credits provide Margery with $5,158 in tax savings, giving her more money to enjoy her [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

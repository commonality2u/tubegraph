Upon retirement, many Canadians anticipate receiving Old Age Security (OAS) payments, which can be up to $948 annually for the 2024 income year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. However, these payments are subject to a "recovery tax," commonly known as the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This clawback begins when an individual's income exceeds the threshold of $90,997 for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. If income reaches or exceeds $153,700 (or $153,700 for those age 75 and over, which is $9,481 annually), the entire OAS benefit can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. The recovery tax is 15% on the amount over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

For instance, David, a 75-year-old, with an income of $160,000 in 2024 would lose all his OAS benefits because the 15% recovery tax on the amount over the threshold ($90,995) totals $10,300, which exceeds his annual OAS benefit of $9,481 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Fortunately, strategies exist to reduce or avoid this clawback, helping retirees preserve more of their OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA)

A [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] is a powerful tool to help avoid the OAS clawback because withdrawals from it are entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This means funds can be accessed for living expenses without increasing your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>, thereby helping you stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:04">[06:06:04]</a>.

For example, withdrawing $20,000 annually from a $100,000 [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] for living expenses incurs no taxes and isn't counted as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This is especially beneficial if your taxable income is already near the OAS clawback threshold of $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Without this strategy, withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like an RRSP could push your income over the threshold, triggering the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. The flexibility offered by a [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] allows for [[optimizing_tfsa_withdrawals_in_retirement | tax-free income]] access, protecting your OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### Pro Tip: The RSP to TFSA Ladder
Consider gradually withdrawing from your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and contributing to your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] before the age of 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. This strategy, also known as the [[using_tfsa_and_rrsp_accounts_to_control_taxable_income | RSP to TFSA ladder]], helps keep your taxable income lower in later retirement years and allows for tax-free withdrawals from your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]], minimizing the OAS clawback effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Pension Income Splitting

[[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | Pension income splitting]] is another effective way to reduce taxable income and avoid the OAS clawback, particularly when one spouse earns significantly less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This strategy allows you to transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

As an example, consider Peter Parker, who earns $60,000 annually from his pension, while his wife, Mary Jane, earns a much lower amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. By using [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | pension income splitting]], Peter can transfer $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000, potentially moving him into a lower tax bracket and decreasing the risk of triggering the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Mary Jane, being in a lower tax bracket, will be taxed on the $30,000 she receives, resulting in a lower overall tax burden for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. Crucially, by lowering Peter's taxable income, they can keep his total income below the OAS clawback threshold of $90,997, preserving his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. This strategy is particularly valuable for couples with income disparities, as it not only lowers their tax burden but also protects OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Integrating strategies like utilizing your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] and [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | pension income splitting]] into your [[tax_planning_for_retirement_in_Canada | retirement planning]] is crucial for avoiding the OAS clawback and maximizing your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. These proactive measures can result in significant savings over your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

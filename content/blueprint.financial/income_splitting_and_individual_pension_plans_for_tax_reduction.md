When an individual passes away, their entire Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) balance is added to their income for that year and taxed at their highest marginal tax rate, potentially pushing it into the highest tax bracket (e.g., 53% in Ontario) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This can result in a significant portion of the RSP disappearing to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For example, a $700,000 RSP balance could result in $371,000 owed in taxes, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Fortunately, several effective methods exist to minimize or prevent this substantial tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting strategies]] and [[advanced_retirement_tax_strategies_like_family_trusts_and_individual_pension_plans | Individual Pension Plans]] are two such approaches.

## RSP Income Splitting Strategies

### Spousal Rollover

A spousal rollover is a strategy that defers the tax liability on an RSP balance upon the death of the holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

#### How it Works
If you have a spouse or common-law partner, your entire RSP balance can be rolled over to their RSP or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) tax-free upon your death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This defers the tax payment until the surviving spouse begins withdrawing the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

#### Example
When Michael passes away with a $700,000 RSP balance, instead of it being immediately taxed at 53%, it is transferred tax-free to his wife Emily's RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Emily will not owe taxes until she starts withdrawing from the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

#### Pros
*   Provides immediate tax deferral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Allows the surviving spouse control over when to withdraw funds, potentially leading to future tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

#### Cons
*   Only applicable if you have a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   Taxes are deferred, not eliminated; they will be due when the spouse withdraws or passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   This is a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Strategic RSP Income Splitting During Retirement

This [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategy]] involves leveraging differing income tax brackets between spouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

#### How it Works
The higher-earning spouse contributes to a spousal RSP in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The lower-income spouse can then withdraw these funds gradually in retirement, which can lower the overall RSP balance and reduce the significant tax hit when the RSP holder passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

#### Example
Mark, in a 45% tax bracket, contributes $20,000 annually to his wife Susan's spousal RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Mark receives a tax deduction at his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In retirement, Susan withdraws $40,000 annually from her spousal RSP, taxed at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This approach reduces taxes during retirement and diminishes Mark's overall RSP balance, leading to a much smaller tax bill upon his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

#### Pros
*   Reduces the RSP balance at death by shifting withdrawals to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   Allows for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement, lowering the tax hit both during life and at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

#### Cons
*   Only effective if one spouse is in a lower income bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   Requires careful planning and consistent contributions to the spousal RSP over time for maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Individual Pension Plans (IPP) for Business Owners

An [[advanced_retirement_tax_strategies_like_family_trusts_and_individual_pension_plans | Individual Pension Plan (IPP)]] is a powerful tool primarily for business owners to manage and transfer wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

#### How it Works
Unlike an RSP, which is fully taxed as income upon death, an IPP allows you to add your children to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. When the owner passes away, the IPP can be taken over by the children, avoiding the large immediate tax hit that occurs with RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The children are only taxed as they withdraw funds, spreading the tax liability over many years and even generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

#### Example
Paul, a business owner, transfers $500,000 from his RSP into an IPP and contributes more via his corporation, growing the IPP to $1.5 million over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. He then adds his children, Jason and Emma, as members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Upon Paul's death, Jason and Emma take over the IPP and are not immediately taxed on the full balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. They pay tax only as they withdraw funds, allowing them to control the tax impact and potentially remain in lower tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

#### Pros
*   **Defers Taxation:** Spreads the tax liability over many years as children make withdrawals, unlike an RSP where the entire balance is taxed upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Lower Tax Impact:** Gradual withdrawals allow beneficiaries to remain in lower tax brackets, reducing total taxes owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Tax-Efficient Wealth Transfer:** The IPP passes to children without an immediate tax event, preserving the full value of the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

#### Cons
*   **IPP Management:** Beneficiaries need to manage the IPP and ensure withdrawals suit their income and corporate situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Corporate Involvement:** Children must be employed by the business and receive T4 income to participate in the IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Combining Strategies

Strategic financial planning often involves combining multiple approaches to build a strong, tax-efficient future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

#### Example Blueprint
Jerry, who earns more than Kim, contributes to her [[income_splitting_and_spousal_retirement_savings | spousal RSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Upon retirement, Kim withdraws from her RSP at a lower tax rate, saving thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Simultaneously, Jerry makes gradual RSP withdrawals to spread out his tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. To further protect their estate, they purchase life insurance to cover the taxes owed on Jerry's RSP after he passes, ensuring their children inherit the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Jerry uses his gradual RSP withdrawals to cover the insurance premiums, effectively trading his RSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This combined approach smooths out their tax burden and maximizes the inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can be a strategic financial decision for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While starting CPP at age 60 might seem appealing, there are several significant advantages to waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Reasons to Delay CPP Collection

### 1. Higher Payouts

One of the most apparent [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_60 | benefits of delaying CPP past 60]] is receiving significantly more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | impact of delaying CPP collection]] on your benefits can be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Consider Jennifer's example:
*   **Starting at age 65:** Jennifer receives a baseline of $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Starting at age 60:** Her benefits are reduced by 0.6% per month, totaling a 36% reduction compared to age 65, resulting in only $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Delaying to age 70:** Her benefits increase by 0.7% per month, totaling a 42% increase compared to age 65, resulting in $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Delaying CPP to age 70 can more than double the monthly benefit compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### 2. Sufficient Income or Savings

If you possess enough income or savings to cover your expenses until age 70, delaying CPP is a strong consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. By drawing from sources like RRSPs, TFSAs, or workplace pensions between ages 60 and 70, your investments can continue to grow, and you avoid reducing your CPP benefits early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This strategy enhances financial stability and provides higher guaranteed income later in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### 3. Good Health and Longer Life Expectancy

If you are in good health and expect to live longer, delaying CPP can be a great choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. A 60-year-old in Canada today is expected to live to about 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Starting CPP at 60 locks in a lower monthly amount for life, which might not be sufficient if you live longer than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Delaying hedges against the risk of outliving other retirement savings, as CPP payments last for the rest of your life once started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The break-even point where you earn more by delaying CPP from ages 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. If you anticipate living past this age, delaying your CPP is an excellent choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 4. Inflation Protection

CPP benefits are indexed to inflation, meaning your payouts will increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The longer you delay your CPP, the larger your inflation-indexed payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This unique feature makes CPP a valuable asset against rising costs in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 5. Trust in CPP Management and Sustainability

Concerns about the CPP running out of money are common, but the system is designed to be financially sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>:
*   **Growing Contributions:** CPP contributions are projected to grow significantly, ensuring a continuous flow of cash into the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Regular Reviews:** The CPP undergoes independent peer reviews, and the latest report determined it was financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Strong Investment Returns:** The CPP Investment Portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as per the 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

These factors indicate a low risk of the CPP being underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### 6. Avoiding OAS Clawback

Old Age Security (OAS) payments can be clawed back if your income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The OAS clawback starts if you earn more than $90,997 (as of the latest figures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If your CPP payments are too high while collecting OAS, they might push you into this clawback territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. If you expect your overall income to be well below this threshold, delaying CPP allows for higher benefits without triggering the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is an important consideration for [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | Impact of delaying CPP and OAS on benefits]].

> [!example] Simon's Income Example
> Simon's annual income after age 70 includes:
> *   Employment pensions: $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
> *   RRSPs: $20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>
> *   Investment income: $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>
> *   CPP benefits (starting at age 70): $21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>
> His total income is $81,000, which is below the $90,997 threshold, so no OAS clawback applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. He benefits from larger CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### 7. Not Qualifying for Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from sources like RRSPs or work pensions, you likely won't qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In such cases, delaying CPP to receive larger payments won't impact your eligibility for GIS, as your income would already be above the limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 8. RRSP Tax Planning

Delaying CPP can facilitate RSP tax planning, especially if you wish to draw down your RRSPs quicker between ages 60 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This strategy can help minimize RRSP taxes upon death, leaving more money for your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. When CPP kicks in at age 70, your annual CPP benefits can cover a significant portion of your expenses, reducing the need for large withdrawals from other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### 9. Still Working in Your 60s

If you plan to continue working into your 60s or even 70s, it may not make sense to take CPP early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>:
*   You likely won't need the CPP income if you're still working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   You are required to continue making CPP contributions between ages 60 and 65, even if you start collecting early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   The benefit from delaying CPP will likely be greater than investing the early CPP payments in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### 10. More Predictable and Stable Income

Delaying CPP allows you to trade uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. By using your savings (like RRSPs or TFSAs) to cover expenses earlier, you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for the rest of your life starting later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This provides a more predictable and stable income stream in later retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

> [!tip] Personal Financial Situation
> While there are many reasons to delay CPP, the optimal decision depends on your personal financial situation and unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Upon the death of an RRSP holder, the entire RRSP balance is typically added to their income for that year and taxed at their highest marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This can result in a significant portion of the RRSP disappearing due to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For instance, in Ontario, a $700,000 RRSP balance could be taxed at 53%, resulting in a $371,000 tax bill and leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

To prevent this substantial tax hit, several strategies can be employed, with the spousal rollover being one of the most common for tax deferral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## How Spousal RRSP Rollover Works

If an RRSP holder has a spouse or common-law partner, their entire RRSP balance can be rolled over to the surviving partner's RRSP or RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) tax-free upon their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This means no immediate taxes are due, allowing the surviving spouse to defer paying taxes until they begin withdrawing the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

For example, if Michael passes away with a $700,000 RRSP, instead of it being taxed at 53%, it can be transferred tax-free to his wife Emily's RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Emily will not owe taxes until she starts making withdrawals from the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Pros of Spousal RRSP Rollover
*   **Immediate Tax Deferral** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>: It prevents an immediate tax hit on the RRSP balance upon the first spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Control over Withdrawals**: The surviving spouse gains control over when to withdraw the funds, allowing for potential future tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Cons of Spousal RRSP Rollover
*   **Requires a Spouse/Partner**: This strategy is only applicable if the deceased has a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Tax Deferral, Not Elimination**: Taxes are deferred, not eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The tax liability will still arise when the surviving spouse starts making withdrawals and when they eventually pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Therefore, this strategy is considered a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Another strategy that utilizes a spousal RRSP is [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **How it works**: The higher-earning spouse contributes to a spousal RRSP in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The higher-earning spouse receives a tax deduction in their higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: In retirement, the lower-income spouse can withdraw these funds gradually, taxing them at their lower marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This approach not only helps save taxes during retirement but also reduces the overall balance of the higher-earning spouse's RRSP, leading to a smaller tax hit for the estate upon their death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Example**: Mark, in a 45% tax bracket, contributes $20,000 annually to his wife Susan's spousal RRSP. Susan, expecting to be in a 20% tax bracket in retirement, can withdraw $40,000 per year from her spousal RRSP at her lower rate, significantly reducing the overall tax burden compared to if Mark had retained all the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Combining Multiple Strategies
Financial planning can be compared to building a house, where combining multiple strategies creates a strong tax-efficient future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. A common blueprint used by advisors often combines [[spousal_rsp_contributions_for_tax_efficiency | spousal RRSP contributions]], [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | gradual RRSP withdrawals]], and life insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

For instance, Jerry, who earns more than Kim, contributes to her spousal RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. When they retire, Kim withdraws from her RRSP at a lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Simultaneously, Jerry makes gradual RRSP withdrawals to spread out his tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. To further protect their estate, they purchase life insurance to cover the taxes owed on Jerry's RRSP after he passes away, ensuring their children inherit the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Jerry uses his gradual RRSP withdrawals to cover these insurance premiums, further reducing the tax hit and effectively trading his RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This combined approach smooths out their tax burden and maximizes inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

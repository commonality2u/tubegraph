Retirement marks a significant transition from decades of saving and investing to finally enjoying the fruits of that labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, many retirees face a common "save or spend dilemma," unsure how much to spend versus how much to keep in savings each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This difficulty often stems from a [[mindset_shift_in_retirement_spending | complete mindset shift]] required to move from a [[scarcity_mindset_and_saving | scarcity mindset]] to an abundance mindset, where individuals feel confident using what they've saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be Detrimental

While caution might seem prudent, hesitating to spend sufficiently in retirement can lead to several negative outcomes:

### Missed Experiences and Opportunities
Retirees who are reluctant to spend may miss out on significant life experiences such as travel, pursuing hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enhance their "golden years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are the moments that make retirement fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Healthspan vs. Lifespan
Dr. Peter Attia, in his book *Outlive*, distinguishes between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting enjoyment of what was saved for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Inflation's Impact
Inflation steadily erodes the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While a properly structured retirement plan should account for inflation to maintain purchasing power, a lack of spending, when combined with insufficient inflation planning, can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be Beneficial

Conversely, a cautious approach to spending in retirement is not entirely negative and can even work in a retiree's favor:

### Encourages Cautious Spending
A hesitation to spend promotes thoughtful, deliberate spending rather than impulsive purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This ensures each financial decision is well-considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Helps Money Last Longer
This careful approach helps money stretch further, reducing the risk of running out of funds prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This is known as reducing longevity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Reduces Portfolio Risk
Spending cautiously helps protect against the impact of market losses, especially those occurring early in retirement, which can drain a portfolio faster than later losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This is called reducing sequence of returns risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Aligns with Legacy Goals
For many retirees, leaving a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes is a major priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Being cautious with spending allows individuals to achieve these [[balancing_spending_and_legacy_goals_in_retirement | legacy goals]] while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The key to navigating the save or spend dilemma is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. A primary challenge is that retirees often don't know how much they can safely spend due to the many variables and factors involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Without this knowledge, it's natural to err on the side of caution, which, while preventing financial shortfall, might also mean not enjoying the wealth built over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

A well-structured [[financial_planning_for_retirement | financial plan]] is essential to overcome this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. By clearly outlining affordable spending limits and stress-testing the investment portfolio, financial planners can help retirees transition from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Case Study: Michael and Karen – Spending More Freely
*   **Profile**: Michael (66) and Karen (64) had a combined income of $180,000 annually (from pensions, CPP, OAS, and investments), with expenses of $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. They had $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their goal was to increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Process**: Despite a $110,000 annual surplus, they were hesitant to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Analysis showed that a 3.5% withdrawal rate from their $4 million portfolio could provide an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams already covered basic expenses, leaving investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Their portfolio was stress-tested for poor market conditions, modeling a 30% decline in value in early years, and it remained safe for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Longevity projections to age 95 also confirmed their portfolio would last well beyond predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Michael and Karen felt confident to book luxury vacations, begin home renovations, and increase charitable contributions, enjoying their retirement without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Easing into Spending
> Clients with larger portfolios often find it harder to spend more money due to deeply ingrained savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. To counter this, try easing into spending by setting small, meaningful goals like little trips or taking up new hobbies, gradually shifting your mindset to enjoy retirement more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Robert and Susan – [[balancing_spending_and_legacy_goals_in_retirement | Balancing Spending and Legacy Goals]]
*   **Profile**: Robert (70) and Susan (68) had a combined income of $100,000 and expenses of $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. They had $1.2 million in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Their goal was to leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Process**: They were cautious about increasing spending, unsure if they could afford more leisure while still leaving enough for family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Analysis showed their $1.2 million portfolio with a 4% withdrawal rate could provide an additional $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover expenses and increase spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Solution**: A slight increase in annual spending from $75,000 to $85,000 was recommended, allowing for more travel and experiences while preserving their inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Stress testing, including potential market downturns, confirmed they could maintain this spending without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Robert and Susan gained confidence to enjoy a higher quality of life now while still leaving a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones, striking the right balance between current enjoyment and long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Many clients, even those with ample savings, struggle with spending due to a strong focus on legacy goals or feelings of guilt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Don't let fear hold you back from enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

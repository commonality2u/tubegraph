Holding mutual funds in Canada, especially in non-registered taxable accounts, can lead to [[tax_saving_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]] that significantly impact investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:40">[08:55:40]</a>. These concerns are often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:40">[08:55:40]</a>.

### Capital Gains Distributions
Mutual funds are required to distribute any realized capital gains to their investors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This means investors may incur taxes on gains even if they haven't sold any shares themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:40">[09:11:40]</a>. For example, if a fund sells appreciated holdings in December, an investor who put money in January could receive a capital gains distribution and a tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.

### Frequent Trading and Higher Tax Rates
[[High fees associated with Canadian mutual funds | Actively managed mutual funds]] often engage in frequent trading, which can generate numerous short-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. These short-term gains are taxed at a higher rate (the investor's regular income tax rate) compared to long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. If a fund manager buys and sells within the same year, the profits are taxed at the regular income tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

### Lack of Control Over Tax Timing
Investors in mutual funds lack control over when capital gains or losses are realized, as these decisions are made by the fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. This can lead to taxable events occurring at inconvenient times, increasing an investor's tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. An investor's plan to hold investments long-term for lower tax rates can be disrupted by the fund manager's frequent taxable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Avoiding Tax Inefficiencies
> To avoid the [[hidden_investment_taxes_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]] of mutual funds, one option is to invest in a [[avoiding_high_fees_in_tfsa_investments | TFSA]] (Tax-Free Savings Account) instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. Investments held within a TFSA are not subject to these tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

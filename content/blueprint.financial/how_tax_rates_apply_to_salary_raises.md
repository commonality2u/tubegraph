A common misconception among Canadians is the belief that a salary increase, which bumps them into a higher [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]], will result in their entire income being taxed at the new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For example, if an individual's salary increases from $55,000 to $60,000, moving them into a higher tax bracket (from 15% to 20.5%), they might mistakenly think their entire $60,000 salary is now taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can lead to the false impression that they are losing money by earning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

This misconception is part of the [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | myths about tax brackets and raises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## How the Progressive Tax System Works

Canada operates under a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This means that different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When a salary increases and enters a new [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]], only the income *within* that new bracket is taxed at the higher rate.

For instance, if someone's income increases to $60,000:
*   The first $57,375 of their income is still taxed at the previous 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the additional $2,625 (the amount above $57,375) is taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   The remainder of the income ($57,375) continues to be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This means that the [[understanding_average_versus_marginal_tax_rates | average or effective tax rate]] is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax rate (20.5% in this example) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Benefits of a Raise

Even when entering a higher tax bracket, a raise always results in taking home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. More income is consistently beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Therefore, individuals should not let tax myths deter them from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This illustrates the [[benefits_of_receiving_a_raise_despite_higher_tax_brackets | benefits of receiving a raise despite higher tax brackets]] and the [[benefits_of_income_growth_despite_tax_increases | benefits of income growth despite tax increases]].

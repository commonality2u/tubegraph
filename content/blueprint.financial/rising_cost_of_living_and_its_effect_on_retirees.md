The rising cost of living is a significant factor contributing to [[factors_contributing_to_falling_retiree_incomes | falling retiree incomes]] and more Canadians working longer into retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The traditional idea of retiring at 65 worked when houses were much cheaper and people didn't live as long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Today, retirees face surging costs without a proportional increase in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, which has a major [[impact_of_inflation_on_canadian_retirees | impact of inflation on Canadian retirees]] and their financial security.

## Key Areas of Rising Costs

### Housing Costs
[[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | Shelter costs]] have seen massive increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   As of February 2024, shelter costs were up 6.2% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   Mortgage interest rates alone jumped over 26%, though they have started to decline slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Both renters and homeowners renewing mortgages are experiencing significant financial pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Food Prices
[[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | Food prices]] have risen over 20% since 2020 and continue to climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. For retirees on a fixed income, every grocery run significantly impacts their budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Healthcare Expenses
Healthcare is a "silent budget killer" for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. While public healthcare covers many services, expenses like dental care, glasses, physiotherapy, and prescriptions often come out-of-pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. These costs tend to increase with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Taxes
Rising costs are compounded by taxes, which can take a substantial portion of a retiree's income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Impact on Retirees

*   **Financial Strain**: It is increasingly difficult for retirees relying on CPP, OAS, and savings to make ends meet, especially if they are still renting, carrying debt, or supporting family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
*   **Reduced Purchasing Power**: [[Impact of inflation on retiree purchasing power | Inflation]], while better than previous years, remains higher than what most retirees planned for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This directly reduces their purchasing power.
*   **Uncertainty and Hesitation**: Even those who believe they have saved enough may hesitate to retire due to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, and rising healthcare expenses contribute to this anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Delaying Retirement**: Many Canadians are delaying retirement not out of necessity, but because they don't feel financially secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. They work longer to build a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This choice is part of a broader trend of [[inflation_concerns_and_retirement_spending | inflation concerns and retirement spending]].
*   **Increased Risk**: Living on a fixed income feels riskier than it used to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. A single unforeseen event, such as a market dip, medical emergency, or rent hike, can derail an entire retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example Scenario: Keanu's Retirement Plan
> Keanu, a 65-year-old single individual, aimed for a modest lifestyle costing $50,000 per year. He had $400,000 in an RRSP and $100,000 in a TFSA, with his home paid off and no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
>
> *   **Early Retirement (Age 65)**: If Keanu retired at 65 and started collecting CPP/OAS immediately, his $500,000 in savings would be depleted by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
> *   **Working Longer (3 more years)**: By working three additional years (until age 68), earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save, Keanu's money would easily last through age 90, leaving an estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This small change provided over a decade of financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
> *   **Strategic Adjustments**: A more strategic approach involving working two more years (until age 67), delaying CPP to age 70 for a higher benefit, and gradually drawing from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69, resulted in a steady income, a lower lifetime tax bill, and an estate of over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Developing a strategic withdrawal plan for your retirement savings, particularly your Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs), is crucial for [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | maximizing government pensions]] like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:19">[01:42:19]</a>. Many focus on contributing to and growing their RRSPs during their working years, but often overlook the importance of a strategic withdrawal plan during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>.

## Why a Strategy is Crucial

Withdrawals from an RRSP are taxed as income in the year they are taken out, which can push you into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. To minimize your tax burden, you must plan your RRSP withdrawals for years when you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:24">[01:21:24]</a>.

## Strategic Early RRSP/RRIF Withdrawal to Maximize CPP and OAS

One key strategy focuses on [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | maximizing your government pension]] by [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying your CPP]] and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. This approach prioritizes withdrawing from your RRSPs and RRIFs for any income you need before starting your government pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>.

### How it Works

Instead of starting CPP at age 65, you can [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delay it until age 70]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a>. If income is needed during this period, you would start withdrawing from your RRSPs and RRIFs to cover expenses until you reach age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:26">[02:04:26]</a>. While delaying until age 70 is beneficial, you can choose to delay until other ages like 66 or 67 depending on your income needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:32">[02:16:32]</a>.

### Specifics of CPP Increases

For CPP benefits, starting at age 60 results in receiving 0.6% less per month compared to age 65, totaling 36% less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:19">[02:30:19]</a>. Conversely, [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] until age 70 can lead to receiving 0.7% more per month than if you started at age 65, for a total of 42% more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly CPP at age 65 would become $1,420 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:49">[02:53:49]</a>.

### Specifics of OAS Increases

For OAS benefits, you receive the full benefit amount at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>. However, [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying it to age 70]] yields 36% more than what you would receive at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. For instance, a $600 full OAS benefit at age 65 would increase to about $816 per month by delaying until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:35">[03:13:35]</a>.

### Benefits of this Strategy

*   **Increased Payments**: This strategy directly leads to higher CPP and OAS payments due to the delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.
*   **Financial Security**: It offers greater certainty because you are trading uncertain returns of an RRSP for the guaranteed, inflation-indexed returns of your CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding OAS Clawbacks**: Strategically managing your income can help you potentially avoid OAS clawbacks, which occur if your net income exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $86,900 for 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:12">[03:55:12]</a>. By keeping taxable income lower during the years before claiming OAS, you can prevent or reduce these clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:12">[03:55:12]</a>.

### Potential Downsides

*   **Health Concerns**: This strategy may not be suitable if you are in poor health or have a family history of shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:04">[04:33:04]</a>. [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying benefits]] makes sense if you expect to live longer; starting earlier might provide more total benefits if your lifespan is shorter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Comfort with RRSP Withdrawals**: Some individuals may be uncomfortable with withdrawing too much from their RRSPs and losing the tax-sheltered status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Integrating TFSA with CPP/OAS for Tax Efficiency

Using your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) wisely can supplement income while minimizing taxes and protecting government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. TFSA withdrawals do not count towards your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This allows you to manage your taxable income each year and remain in your desired tax bracket, preventing benefits like OAS or GIS from being clawed back due to high RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

It's important to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all method for [[timing_cpp_and_oas_benefits_for_tax_savings | timing your CPP and OAS benefits]] and RRSP withdrawals; it depends on your unique financial goals and situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. Your RRSP, TFSA, OAS, and CPP must all work together in harmony to maximize your tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

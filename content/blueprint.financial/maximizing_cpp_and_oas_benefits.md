Developing a strategic withdrawal plan for your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) is crucial for a financially secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. Many individuals focus on contributing to and growing their RSPs during their working years, but often overlook the importance of how to withdraw these funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. The primary goal is to minimize your tax burden by planning RSP withdrawals for years when you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Withdrawals from an RSP are taxed as income in the year they are taken out, which can push you into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Maximizing Government Pensions

### Strategic Early RSP/RRIF Withdrawal to Maximize CPP and OAS

This approach focuses on maximizing your government pensions by delaying your [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. You prioritize withdrawing from your RSPs and Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) for any income you need during the delay period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

Instead of starting CPP at age 65, you can delay it until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. If income is needed during this time, withdraw from your RSPs and RRIFs to cover expenses until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. This can lead to a significant increase in your CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. You do not have to delay until age 70; you can delay to age 66 or 67 or any age you prefer if income is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

*   **CPP Benefit Calculation:**
    *   Starting CPP at age 60 results in a 0.6% reduction per month compared to starting at age 65, totaling a 36% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   Delaying CPP until age 70 results in a 0.7% increase per month compared to starting at age 65, totaling a 42% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
    *   For example, a $1,000/month CPP benefit at age 65 would become $1,420/month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

*   **OAS Benefit Calculation:**
    *   You receive the full OAS benefit amount at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   Delaying OAS until age 70 results in a 36% increase compared to receiving it at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
    *   For example, a $600/month OAS benefit at age 65 would become approximately $816/month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

*   **Benefits of this Strategy:**
    *   **Increased Payments:** Significantly higher [[maximum_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_different_scenarios | CPP and OAS payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Financial Security:** Trades uncertain RSP returns for guaranteed, inflation-indexed CPP returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   **Avoiding OAS Clawbacks:** Can potentially avoid OAS clawbacks if your net income exceeds the threshold ($86,912 in 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. By delaying OAS, you can manage your income to stay below this threshold, potentially gaining over $9,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

*   **Downsides:**
    *   **Health Concerns:** This strategy might not be suitable if you have health issues or a family history of shorter lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. Starting benefits earlier might provide more total benefits in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. However, for those in great health with a family history of longevity, this strategy makes more sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Loss of Tax Shelter:** Some individuals are uncomfortable with withdrawing too much from RSPs and losing their tax-sheltered status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Using TFSA Wisely with Your RSP

Using your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) wisely can supplement your income while minimizing taxes and help you stay in your desired tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

*   **Supplementing Income and Controlling Taxable Income:**
    *   RSP, CPP, and OAS withdrawals are taxable income and can push you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.
    *   TFSA withdrawals, however, do not count towards your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
    *   For example, if you need an additional $30,000 beyond CPP and OAS, withdrawing $10,000 from your RSP and $20,000 from your TFSA keeps your taxable income lower than withdrawing the entire $30,000 from your RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

*   **Managing Excess RSP Funds:**
    *   If you withdraw more from your RSP (e.g., to reduce taxes on death), you can contribute these excess funds to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
    *   This allows your investments to continue growing tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.
    *   Since TFSA withdrawals do not count as income, they help you continue to qualify for government benefits like OAS or GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.
    *   Ensure you have enough TFSA contribution room to avoid penalties from the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>.

## Holistic Financial Planning

Managing your RSP, TFSA, OAS, and CPP requires these accounts to work in harmony to maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. Strategic timing of RSP withdrawals ensures you get the most out of your retirement savings without paying unnecessary taxes or losing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. For instance, excessively high RSP withdrawals can lead to clawbacks of OAS and GIS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

There is no one-size-fits-all method; the best strategy depends on your financial goals and unique situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. For some, withdrawing from RSP early to gain a larger CPP might make sense, while others might prefer to minimize withdrawals and build their RRIF as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.

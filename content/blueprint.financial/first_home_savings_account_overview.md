The [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is a registered plan specifically designed to assist [[tax_advantages_for_firsttime_home_buyers_in_canada | first-time home buyers in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Its primary purpose is to allow individuals to save up to $40,000 tax-free towards the purchase of their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Contribution Limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

*   **Annual Contribution Limit**: You can contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Carry-Forward Rule**: Any unused contribution room can be carried forward, provided you have already opened an FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For instance, opening an FHSA by December 31st allows you to gain $8,000 in contribution room for the next year, and another $8,000 on January 1st of the following year, accumulating $16,000 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Delaying the opening can lead to missing out on valuable accumulated contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

To open an FHSA, you must qualify as a first-time home buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This means you must not have owned a home in the current calendar year or the preceding four calendar years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For example, if you previously owned property but sold it more than four years ago, you would qualify for the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Key Benefits and Features

> [!NOTE] Open your FHSA early!
> It is encouraged to open an FHSA as early as possible to maximize your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

> [!TIP] Unused Funds Flexibility
> Even if you do not use the funds in your FHSA to purchase a home, you have the option to transfer the unused balance to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This transfer does not affect your combined RSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This highlights the [[first_home_savings_account_benefits | First Home Savings Account Benefits]] and offers a valuable [[comparison_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | comparison of FHSA and RRSP]] for [[retirement_savings_fhsa_vs_rrsp | retirement savings]].

> [!TIP] Combining FHSA and HBP for a Larger Down Payment
> When combining the FHSA with [[the_home_buyers_plan_hbp_via_rrsp | the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)]], a couple can collectively save up to $200,000 for their home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This strategy provides significant [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | tax advantages for first-time home buyers in Canada]] and illustrates the power of [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_purchase | combining FHSA and RRSP for home purchase]]. This also affects the [[firsttime_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | Firsttime home savings account FHSA contributions]] and their potential impact.

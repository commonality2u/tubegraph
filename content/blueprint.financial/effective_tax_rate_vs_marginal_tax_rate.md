A common misunderstanding exists regarding how a raise can affect an individual's tax situation, particularly concerning [[tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax brackets in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Common Misconception

When a salary increase, such as moving from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, pushes an individual into a higher tax bracket (e.g., from 15% to 20.5%), a [[misconceptions_about_tax_rates | common mistake Canadians make]] is believing their entire salary will now be taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This misconception leads to the false belief that earning more money might result in a net loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How the [[canadian_tax_structure | Tax System]] Actually Works

Canada operates under a [[progressive_tax_system | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates. For instance:

*   The initial portion of income, up to $57,375, is taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* this threshold is taxed at the higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

For a person earning $60,000:
*   The first $57,375 is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the additional $2,625 (the amount over $57,375) is taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Understanding Effective Tax Rate

Because only a portion of the income is taxed at the highest bracket's rate, the average or effective tax rate on the total income is significantly lower than the highest marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This means that even if you enter a [[financial_benefits_of_higher_income_despite_higher_tax_bracket | higher bracket]], you will always take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Higher income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, and [[misconceptions_about_tax_rates | tax myths]] should not deter individuals from seeking a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

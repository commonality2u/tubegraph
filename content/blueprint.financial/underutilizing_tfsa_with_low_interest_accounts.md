One significant "silent wealth killer" for many Canadians is the underutilization of their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) by treating it as a standard savings account, holding money in cash or low-interest vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A large percentage of Canadians use their TFSA solely for cash or equivalent savings, such as savings accounts or GICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## The Problem: Opportunity Cost

While keeping funds in low-interest accounts may feel safe, it represents a hidden wealth killer due to the enormous opportunity cost of not investing, especially in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Major banks often provide interest rates even much less than 1% on these accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Illustrative Example

Consider two individuals, Sarah and Alex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>:
*   **Sarah** keeps $50,000 in a [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] savings account, earning 1.5% interest annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. After 20 years, her savings barely reach $65,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Alex** invests the same $50,000 in a diversified ETF portfolio, averaging 6% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. After 20 years, Alex's investment grows to nearly $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

This demonstrates a difference of $95,000 in just 20 years, simply from choosing to invest rather than sticking to low-interest savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The power of investing over time can be truly remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Why This Mistake is Common

This common mistake is often rooted in cognitive biases:
*   **Loss Aversion:** The fear of losing money far outweighs the potential for gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Seeing one's account balance grow, even minimally, feels comforting because there's no immediate loss to trigger discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The actual loss is hidden, representing the wealth one fails to grow by not investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Status Quo Bias:** Sticking to what feels familiar, such as leaving money in cash, prevents action even when better options are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Fear of Market Volatility:** This general fear, combined with the biases above, leads many Canadians to leave their [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] vastly underutilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

This habit often persists because the "loss" isn't tangible; the account balance is still growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Avoiding This "Silent Killer"

To avoid this [[common_mistakes_with_tfsa_usage | common mistake]], it is recommended to:
*   Calculate actual cash needs for emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   Invest the remainder of the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

This approach ensures the [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] becomes a true wealth-building tool rather than a stagnant pool of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

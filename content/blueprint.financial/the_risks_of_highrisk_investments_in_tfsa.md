One of the significant [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investing | mistakes to avoid in TFSA investing]] is being overly risky with your investments, often described as "swinging too hard for the fences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>. This approach can severely jeopardize your financial future, especially for younger investors eager for quick gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47">[03:47]</a>.

## The "Swinging for the Fences" Mistake

This common [[red_flags_to_avoid_with_tfsa | red flag to avoid with TFSA]] involves going "all in" on high-risk investments like meme stocks, cryptocurrencies, or penny stocks with the hope of doubling money overnight in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a>.

### Why it Backfires

These types of investments are incredibly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>. Even if an investment doubles, investors often lack the discipline to cash out and move funds into safer options, exposing themselves to even bigger risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07">[04:07]</a>. The more you gamble, the greater your chances of losing big <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>.

As the late Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, wisely stated:
> "The big money is not in the buying and selling but in the waiting." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>

### Consequences of Losses in a TFSA

A significant pitfall of high-risk investments within a TFSA is the impact of losses. For example, if you contribute $10,000 to your TFSA and invest it in a high-risk option that drops by 50%, you're left with just $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40">[04:40]</a>.

The worst part is that in a TFSA, you cannot claim that loss on your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49">[04:49]</a>. Furthermore, you do not get back the contribution room associated with that loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a>. That lost contribution space is gone forever, reducing your future tax-free growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>. Instead of building wealth, such losses can put you in a deeper financial hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01">[05:01]</a>.

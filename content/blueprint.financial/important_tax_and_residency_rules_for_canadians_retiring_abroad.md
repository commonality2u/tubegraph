A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, permanently departed the country in 2024. Many of these individuals were not merely seeking sunshine, but rather aimed to escape high costs, substantial taxes, and the concern of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores why Canadians are choosing to retire abroad and outlines key considerations for a successful transition, including crucial tax and residency rules.

## The High Cost of Retirement in Canada

Living in Canada can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) if they begin collecting at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount, while potentially sufficient decades ago, may not cover living expenses in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For instance, a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto averages about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With additional costs like utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150), monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000 for modest living without homeownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. CPP and OAS benefits barely cover a third of such expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Numbeo data suggests a single person in Toronto spends roughly $1,500 per month without rent, escalating to $3,500-$4,000 monthly with a $2,000 one-bedroom rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This financial pressure leads many Canadians to delay retirement or seek alternative solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Impact of High Costs: A Case Study

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto and spending approximately $50,000 annually, he relies on $18,000 from CPP and OAS, supplementing the rest with RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   By age 70, his TFSA is depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he depends solely on RRSP withdrawals, over $46,000 per year, with effective tax rates exceeding 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   By age 74, he exhausts his savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   By age 76, his net worth turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This scenario highlights how quickly a modest nest egg can diminish in a high-cost city like Toronto, even with modest living expenses and without accounting for inflation, market returns, or unexpected costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Benefits of Retiring Abroad

To address these financial challenges, some Canadians are choosing to retire abroad, seeking destinations where their money can stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This approach can transform the financial outlook of retirement. For instance, in Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 Canadian per month total, or approximately $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. If Seth were to retire in Cancun with his same savings and CPP/OAS income, his portfolio would grow:
*   $387,000 by age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   $586,000 by age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

This demonstrates the significant impact of location on retirement finances, enabling wealth building instead of running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This falls under the general [[Benefits and drawbacks of retiring abroad for Canadians | benefits and drawbacks of retiring abroad for Canadians]].

## Top Retirement Destinations for Canadians

Canadians looking to stretch their pension are increasingly considering [[Top retirement destinations for Canadians seeking to stretch their pension | top retirement destinations for Canadians seeking to stretch their pension]] beyond Canada. Here are some popular options:

### Mexico
Mexico is a top choice for Canadians seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild, spring-like weather in cities such as Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and efficient private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Private insurance is essential as public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visa/Residency**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees and typically requires about $103,000 CAD in savings, depending on the consulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Considerations**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, and some Spanish language skills are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Portugal
For a laid-back European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable living costs for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters and sunny summers, with beach weather in the Algarve almost year-round <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent healthcare; residents can access the public system, and private care is affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Visa/Residency**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring steady income from sources like CPP, pensions, or investments, needing about €870 per month ($1,400 CAD) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights to Toronto and Montreal from Lisbon and Porto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Costs fall between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In Porto, rent might be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses adding $1,700, totaling around $3,000 monthly, similar to lower-end Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

> [!INFO] Financial Planning Example: Seth in Portugal
> Retiring in Porto with $300,000 in savings and $18,000/year from CPP/OAS, and annual spending of $36,000, Seth's savings drop to $199,000 by age 75 and just over $100,000 by age 80. By age 84, his savings are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
>
> To improve this, [[Retirement tax strategies for Canadians | retirement tax strategies for Canadians]] can be applied. If Seth delays CPP to age 70 and draws from his RRSP from ages 65-69, he can lower early taxes, maximize CPP growth, and distribute withdrawals more evenly. This single adjustment extends his savings by two years, meaning he would run out at age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Further adjustments, like working an extra year, trimming spending, or earning hobby income, could make retirement comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Thailand
Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Diverse options from cooler mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) or vibrant cities (Bangkok), with a well-developed expat scene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded healthcare, with many English-speaking doctors and private hospitals often exceeding expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa/Residency**: To qualify for a retirement visa, one must be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai baht (about $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For someone receiving $1,500/month from CPP/OAS, basic needs can be covered, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay
Paraguay is an increasingly popular choice due to its low cost and favorable tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Tax System**: Paraguay operates on a territorial tax system. This means foreign income, such as CPP, OAS, RIFs (Registered Income Funds), or pensions, is not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This is a significant consideration regarding [[Tax implications on Canadian income for nonresidents | tax implications on Canadian income for nonresidents]].
*   **Cost**: In Asunción, monthly living expenses average about $628, with rent for a one-bedroom around $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month for a comfortable lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Visa/Residency**: Paraguay offers relatively straightforward paths to obtaining a permanent residency visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Spain
Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent healthcare; affordable private insurance is required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,507, with one-bedroom city center rent at about $1,300, bringing total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is comparable to parts of Canada or slightly cheaper than some areas in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Visa/Residency**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, which requires about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This may require strategic planning, such as earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Important Tax and Residency Rules for Canadians

Understanding Canadian tax residency status when relocating is crucial. [[Understanding Canadian tax residency status when relocating | Understanding Canadian tax residency status when relocating]] directly impacts benefits and tax obligations.

### OAS Payments Abroad: The 20-Year Rule

A critical rule that many Canadians overlook is how moving abroad can affect Old Age Security (OAS) payments, directly impacting [[Implications of moving abroad on Canadian retirement benefits | Canadian retirement benefits]].
*   **In-Canada Application**: If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you only need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Out-of-Canada Application/Maintenance**: To continue receiving OAS payments long-term while living outside Canada, you generally need 20 years of Canadian residency after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **The Gap**: If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving Canada, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] David's OAS Scenario
> David, aged 67, has 15 years of Canadian residency and begins collecting OAS while living in Calgary. He then retires to Thailand. Six months later, his OAS payments cease because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and David did not meet the 20-year residency threshold to maintain benefits abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

It is essential to know these rules before moving abroad to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

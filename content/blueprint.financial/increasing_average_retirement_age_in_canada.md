From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Canadians are increasingly working past the traditional retirement age of 65, a trend that marks a significant shift in [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement planning]] and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This shift is influenced by various factors, including changing demographics, economic realities, and evolving perceptions of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Current Trends in Retirement Age

Historically, Canadians were retiring earlier, with the average retirement age dipping to 60.9 years in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, this trend has reversed:
*   **2010:** Average retirement age rose to 62.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **2020:** Average retirement age reached 64.3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **2024:** The average retirement age has climbed to 65.3 years, the highest it's been in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

This represents a full 4-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after that age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Who is Working Longer?
In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Their reasons varied:
*   **12%** worked by choice, seeking to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **9%** worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Different employment sectors also show varying retirement patterns:
*   **Public sector employees:** Tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Private sector workers:** Typically hold out until about 65 and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Self-employed Canadians:** Push retirement furthest, averaging nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## [[reasons_canadians_are_working_longer_and_retiring_later | Reasons Canadians Are Working Longer and Retiring Later]]

Several significant factors contribute to the increasing average retirement age in Canada:

### 1. Canadians are Living Longer
Increased life expectancy is a major driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy increases the older one gets. For example:
*   **At 40:** Average Canadian man can expect to live to 78, women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **At 60:** Men are projected to live to about 80.5, women to 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **At 70:** Men reach about 83.2, women about 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

If healthy at 65, individuals can expect two or more decades ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means retirement is no longer a 10-year plan but a 20 to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### 2. Pension Coverage Has Changed
The prevalence of defined benefit (DB) pensions, which provided predictable lifetime income, has decreased, especially in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Defined Contribution (DC) plans:** More common now, where retirement income depends on investment performance, shifting more risk and responsibility to the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Workplace pension coverage:** Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This means the majority of Canadians must manage their own [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | retirement savings]] through vehicles like RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without matching income boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Key areas impacted include:
*   **Shelter costs:** Up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Groceries:** Food prices have jumped over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** While public healthcare covers many services, out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

These [[breakdown_of_retiree_expenses_in_canada | rising expenses]] make it harder for those living off government benefits (CPP, OAS) and savings to make ends meet, especially if they have rent, debt, or family obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Taxes]] also quietly take a significant bite out of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 4. Work Has Gotten Less Physical
Many jobs are less physically demanding than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. While historically, jobs like construction or manufacturing often led to physical limitations by 65, more Canadians now work in knowledge-based or service roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. These roles often involve desk work, calls, or computers, and can even be done from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. If a job isn't physically taxing and individuals remain mentally sharp, there's less physical impetus to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
A generational mindset shift is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For many, retirement isn't about escape but about freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This freedom doesn't necessarily mean ceasing work entirely; it can involve:
*   Consulting part-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Teaching courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Taking freelance gigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   Starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Retirement is becoming less of a "cliff" and more of a "ramp," transitioning slowly into something more flexible and personally fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Many retirees find endless free time unfulfilling and prefer to reshape their work to fit their lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" is quietly reshaping retirement timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The number of Canadians over 50 getting divorced has been rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Late-life separations often cause a major financial reset, requiring assets to be split and potentially supporting two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This can necessitate delaying retirement, downsizing, or re-entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Uncertainty as a "Retirement Killer"
Even with sufficient savings on paper, uncertainty can cause hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation (even if lower than previous years) contribute to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tensions further add to concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Many delay retirement not out of absolute necessity, but for peace of mind and to build a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Relying solely on CPP, OAS, and savings feels riskier, as one major unexpected event could derail a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## The Trade-off: Time vs. Money in Retirement

While working longer can provide financial security, time is considered the most valuable asset in retirement, especially as one ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The goal should be to retire as early as safely possible to enjoy healthy years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Retirement Planning Scenarios: Keanu's Case Study

To illustrate how small adjustments can significantly impact [[challenges_of_retirement_in_canada | retirement viability]], let's consider Keanu, a 65-year-old single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

**Keanu's Profile:**
*   Age: 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Goal: Modest lifestyle, spending $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>
*   Pre-retirement income: $90,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
*   Savings: $400,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>
*   Assets: Home paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
*   Pensions: No corporate pension. CPP and OAS assumed at standard eligibility (age 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Retiring at 65 (Cold Turkey)
*   Keanu retires at 65, immediately collects CPP and OAS, and lives off savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Runs out of money by around age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The RRSP depletes quickly, and the TFSA is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

> [!note] Lesson
> While $500,000 in savings sounds substantial, it might not be enough for a 25-year retirement without a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Working 3 More Years
*   Keanu works for three additional years (until age 68), earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He still takes CPP and OAS at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Money easily lasts through age 90, with a net estate of over $400,000 remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Improvement
> Just three extra years of work provides over a decade of financial breathing room in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Working 2 More Years, Delaying CPP to 70 (without smart withdrawal)
*   Keanu works two more years (until age 67) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Instead of starting CPP at 65, he waits until 70 to lock in a higher monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Still faces a shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. He aggressively dips into his RRSP between ages 67 and 69 to cover the gap, draining it too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

> [!caution] Lesson
> Delaying CPP is powerful, but without a smart withdrawal strategy (e.g., from RRSP), it can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Working 2 More Years, Delaying CPP to 70 (with smart RRSP withdrawal)
*   Keanu retires at 67 and delays CPP to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This time, he draws gradually from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69, just enough to cover his needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Achieves a steady income through retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate remaining over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

> [!success] Outcome
> A combination of working two extra years, delaying CPP, and strategically drawing from RRSPs provides the necessary financial balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

This example highlights that effective [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement planning]] involves more than just accumulating savings; it requires strategic sequencing of payments and withdrawals, considering factors like [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | taxes]], OAS clawbacks, inflation, and healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. By tweaking a few levers like timing CPP, drawing down smartly, and working slightly longer, a workable plan can be built without drastically increasing savings or working until a very late age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

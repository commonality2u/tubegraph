Tracking your goals makes you 33% more likely to achieve them, according to a study at Michigan State University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle applies directly to finances; tracking net worth can transform financial management and help grow wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?

Tracking your net worth is comparable to [[comparison_between_tracking_net_worth_and_weight_loss | tracking weight loss]]; small, consistent actions can drive significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania showed that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw notable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Those tracking 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This highlights that tracking is correlated with success towards goals, even if not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The same principle applies to finances: [[tracking_and_analyzing_your_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly allows you to spot trends, make smarter decisions, and stay on course toward financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Consistency, not perfection, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> "Tracking your net worth is like steering a ship with a compass. Without that compass, you won't know if you begin to drift off course." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

## Benefits of Using a Spreadsheet

A spreadsheet offers several advantages for [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | tracking net worth]]:

*   **Ease of Use** A simple Google Sheet or similar spreadsheet makes tracking easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Setting up a tracker takes about 10 to 20 minutes, and monthly updates can take as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Visual Dashboard & Summary Data** A well-designed spreadsheet can provide a visual dashboard showing your current net worth, net worth goal, and the shortfall needed to reach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It also offers net worth summary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Trend Analysis** As you fill out data throughout the year, the dashboard becomes more valuable, showing your net worth trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. This allows you to identify dips and understand what caused them, such as market fluctuations or changes in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This representation helps you pinpoint and address issues, like re-evaluating risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Customization and Control** Spreadsheets are completely free, provide full control over your data, and are highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. This hands-on approach can be rewarding, keeping you engaged with your finances and providing a clear visual overview of your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Historical Tracking** By creating a new spreadsheet copy each year and deleting previous data, you can accumulate a balance sheet of your net worth throughout the years, allowing for historical comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Spreadsheet vs. Alternative Tools

While several [[alternative_tools_for_tracking_net_worth_in_canada | alternative tools for tracking net worth in Canada]] exist, they often come with costs or limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>:

*   **Wetha**: Connects to financial accounts for automatic overviews, but advanced features require a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Mint (Replaced by Quicken)**: Mint was free and popular but has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While comprehensive, its cost may not be justified given free alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app with a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Tools like Wetha, Quicken, and PocketGuard offer automation but incur costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. A spreadsheet, on the other hand, is free and gives you complete control over the tracking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

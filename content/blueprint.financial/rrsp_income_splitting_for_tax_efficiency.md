[[Income splitting strategies | RRSP income splitting]] is a strategy designed to reduce the tax burden on your [[RRSP withdrawal strategies for retirement | RRSP withdrawals]] and minimize the tax impact upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This method involves the higher-earning spouse contributing to a spousal RRSP in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The lower-income spouse can then make gradual withdrawals in retirement, which helps to reduce the overall RRSP balance and decrease the significant tax liability that would otherwise occur when the RRSP holder passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## How it Works: An Example

Consider Mark, who is in a 45% tax bracket, and his wife Susan, who is projected to be in a 20% tax bracket during her retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Mark contributes $20,000 annually into Susan's spousal RRSP over several years, claiming a tax deduction at his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Upon retirement, Susan begins withdrawing $40,000 per year from her spousal RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. These withdrawals are taxed at her lower 20% rate, which is considerably less than Mark's 45% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This strategy not only helps the couple save taxes during retirement but also progressively reduces Mark's overall RRSP balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

By the time Mark passes away, his RRSP balance is smaller, leading to a significantly reduced tax hit on his estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. If Mark had kept all RRSP funds in his own account, his estate could have faced a substantial tax bill upon his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Through strategic [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] with Susan, the RRSP value was gradually diminished and taxed at a lower rate, resulting in overall lower taxes paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
*   **Reduces RRSP Balance at Death**: By shifting withdrawals to a lower-income spouse, the size of the RRSP balance at death is reduced, thereby lowering the final tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: This strategy allows for more tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement, reducing the tax impact both during one's lifetime and at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Cons
*   **Income Bracket Dependency**: This method is only effective if one spouse is in a demonstrably lower income bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning Required**: It necessitates meticulous planning and consistent contributions to the spousal RRSP over time to achieve maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Combining Strategies

[[Income splitting strategies | RRSP income splitting]] can be combined with other [[income_splitting_strategies | tax planning strategies]] to build a robust financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. For instance, a common blueprint involves:
1.  **Spousal RRSP Contributions**: The higher-earning spouse contributes to the lower-earning spouse's spousal RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
2.  **Gradual RRSP Withdrawals**: The higher-earning spouse also makes gradual [[RRSP withdrawal strategies for retirement | RRSP withdrawals]] to spread out the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
3.  **Life Insurance Purchase**: Life insurance can be purchased to cover the taxes owed on the remaining RRSP at death, ensuring beneficiaries receive the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The gradual RRSP withdrawals can be used to pay for these insurance premiums, effectively trading RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

This combined approach smooths out the tax burden and maximizes inheritance for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

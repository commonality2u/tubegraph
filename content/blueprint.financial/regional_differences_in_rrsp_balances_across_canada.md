The 2023 survey provides a detailed regional breakdown of RRSP holdings, indicating that provinces approach RRSP management differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Key Regional Findings (2023)

*   **Ontario** led all provinces with the highest average RRSP balance, reaching $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Canada** recorded the highest average contribution, with individuals contributing $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This finding is notable given that the speaker states that the region does not have "much higher incomes and lower cost of living" as might be assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Regardless of location, Canadians remain committed to their RRSPs, whether by accumulating larger account balances or consistently making contributions year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

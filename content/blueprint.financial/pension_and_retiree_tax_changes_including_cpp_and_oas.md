Canada has introduced several tax changes for pensions and retirees in 2025, affecting [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | CPP contributions]] and [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS repayment thresholds]], among other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Understanding these updates can help maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## CPP Contributions

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) now features two levels of contributions with updated thresholds and rates for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>:

*   **Regular CPP**
    *   Applies to income up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   The YMPE for 2025 is $71,200, an increase from $68,500 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   Contributions are calculated after a $3,500 basic exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   The contribution rate remains at 5.95% for employees and employers, totaling 11.9% combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **CPP2**
    *   Applies to additional earnings between the YMPE ($71,200) and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   The YAMPE for 2025 is $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   The contribution rate is 4% for employees and employers, and 8% for self-employed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Impact on Earners

*   **Lower Earners**: Individuals earning below $71,200 will see no or minimal changes to their CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Higher Earners**: Those earning up to $81,300 will experience notable increases due to the CPP2 contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. For example, someone earning $80,000 will pay over $500 more in [[tax_implications_of_cpp_payments | CPP]] in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

These higher contributions are intended to translate into larger [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, serving as an investment in future [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Repayment Threshold

For the 2024 income year, the OAS repayment threshold is set at $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

*   If your net income exceeds this amount, you may need to repay part or all of your OAS pension through a recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The repayment is calculated as 15% of the income exceeding the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   The recovery tax period runs from July 2025 to June 2026, based on your 2024 income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   The OAS recovery tax is deducted monthly from your OAS payments during the specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] OAS Repayment Calculation
> If your net income for 2024 is $100,000, your excess income above the threshold ($90,995) would be approximately $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The repayment amount would be 15% of this excess, or about $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Consequently, your full OAS payment would be reduced by $1,350 during the July 2025 to June 2026 period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Age Amount Credit

The Age Amount Credit is a non-refundable [[retirement_tax_credits_in_canada | tax credit]] for Canadians aged 65 and older, designed to reduce federal income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   For the 2025 tax year, the maximum age amount is $9,288, up from $8,790 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   You are eligible for the full credit if your net income is below $45,522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   The credit is reduced by 15% of net income exceeding this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   It is fully eliminated when net income reaches approximately $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

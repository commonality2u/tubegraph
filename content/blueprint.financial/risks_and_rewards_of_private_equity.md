[[private_equity_in_canada | Private equity]] is considered a high-stakes investment game, often likened to an exclusive VIP club that requires substantial capital, the right connections, and patience for a large payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It involves investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments typically include funding startups, financing turnarounds, or supporting business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Potential Rewards
Unlike traditional stocks, private equity offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit their capital for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For those who are patient and strategic, private equity can be a powerful tool for wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Risks and Downsides
Despite the potential for high rewards, [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] comes with notable drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Higher Risk and Limited Liquidity
[[private_equity_in_canada | Private equity]] carries higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity compared to traditional stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell, and there is always a [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_tfsa | risk of losing the entire investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. An example of this risk is the Walton International Group, a land syndication venture that fell under [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] real estate investing, which filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses over three years, impacting many Canadian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### High Fees
[[private_equity_in_canada | Private equity]] investments come with significant costs, including management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Understanding these expenses is crucial before investing, as they can dramatically impact profits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Long Lockup Periods
Investors must be prepared to commit their funds for extended periods, often between 5 to 10 years, before seeing any returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. For example, an investment of $100,000 in private equity might take five years to go public and yield a return of $300,000, but during those five years, the funds are inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Compatibility with RSPs
Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) are primarily designed for publicly traded investments and typically do not allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means that, unless investing through a specialized structure, [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] investments generally need to be held outside an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Despite these restrictions, certain self-directed RSPs provide access to [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts allow investors to hold CRA-approved [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] funds, enabling them to enjoy tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Examples include the North Leaf Capital Partners [[private_equity_in_canada | Private Equity]] Fund, a Canadian fund available to some RSP accounts, and select [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] investments offered through Wealth Simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, many [[private_equity_in_canada | private equity]] investments will not be available through RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[private_equity_in_canada | Private equity]] is not for the faint of heart, but for those who are patient and strategic, it can be a powerful wealth-building tool that extends beyond traditional RSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

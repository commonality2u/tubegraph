Canadians often face high tax rates, with the highest brackets reaching over 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. [[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is a key strategy used to help save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] involves shifting income from a higher-income partner to a lower-income partner, allowing couples to take advantage of lower tax brackets and potentially save thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. It's like sharing an umbrella in the rain, where both partners stay drier by balancing the load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Key [[income_splitting_strategies | Income Splitting Strategies]]

### Using the FHSA (First Home Savings Account)

The FHSA can be a useful tool for [[strategies_for_family_tax_savings_and_income_splitting | income splitting]], though it is a relatively new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   **How it works**: The higher-income partner gifts money to the lower-income partner, who then contributes it to their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This avoids taxable investments and provides a tax deduction for the low-income partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Example**: If Jerry (high-income) gives $8,000 to Elaine (low-income), and Elaine contributes it to her FHSA, she receives a $2,400 tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This can result in $2,532 in total tax savings for the couple, as the investments grow tax-free in the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Effectiveness**: This strategy offers immediate tax savings, tax-free growth, and the flexibility to roll the funds into an RRSP if the FHSA is not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. It is most effective when the higher-income partner has already maximized their registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### [[pension_income_splitting | Pension Income Splitting]]

[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] allows for the transfer of pension income to a lower-income spouse, balancing taxable income and reducing household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

*   **Eligibility**:
    *   Before age 65: Only defined benefit pension plans (DBPs) qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   After age 65: Defined contribution pension plans (DCPPs), RRIFs (Registered Retirement Income Funds), and LIFs (Life Income Funds) also qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Example**: If Jerry earns $40,000 from his pension, taxed at 30%, and allocates $20,000 to Elaine (taxed at 15%), their household taxes can be reduced from $12,000 to $9,000, saving $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | Spousal RRSP Contributions]]

[[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | Spousal RRSPs]] enable the higher-income partner to contribute to the lower-income spouse's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This defers taxes and helps balance [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

*   **Example**: If Jerry contributes $12,000 to Elaine's RRSP, his taxable income is reduced by $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. When Elaine withdraws the funds at a 20% tax rate, the couple saves $1,800 in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: Avoid early withdrawals within three years of contribution to prevent the income from being attributed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### [[cpp_income_splitting | CPP Income Splitting]]

Couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can split up to 50% of their benefits, thereby lowering their overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

*   **Example**: If Jerry shifts $3,000 of his CPP income to Elaine, they can save $450 in taxes by utilizing her lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Splitting Capital Losses

This strategy involves offsetting one spouse's capital gains with the other's capital losses, adhering to superficial loss rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

*   **Example**: If Jerry has a $4,000 capital loss early in the year, it can offset Elaine's $15,000 gain, potentially saving $800 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: This strategy only applies to non-registered accounts and must comply with CRA rules regarding timing and holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Hiring a Family Member

For self-employed individuals or business owners, hiring a spouse or family member can be an effective way to split income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

*   **How it works**: Pay a reasonable salary to a spouse or family member who genuinely helps with the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This shifts income to someone in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Example**: If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 for their contributions (who is at a 20% tax rate), your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This can result in $10,500 in savings for you, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The net family tax savings could be $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Important Note**: The salary paid must be reasonable for the work performed, as the CRA is very strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs as an [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | medical expense]] on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible to claim medical travel expenses, you must travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services that are not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Types of Claimable Expenses

[[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | Eligible travel expenses]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>:

*   **Public Transportation**: Such as bus, train, taxi, or flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Vehicle Expenses**: Including fuel, parking, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Example: Jennifer's Medical Travel Claim

Consider Jennifer, who earns $55,000 annually and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over a period of three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Her expenses are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>:
*   Gas and parking: $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Meals and accommodations: $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   **Total Travel Expenses**: $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>

To [[calculation_of_medical_expense_tax_credits | calculate her claim]], 3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
Her eligible claim is $2,300 (total expenses) minus $1,650 (3% of income), which equals $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
Therefore, Jennifer can [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claim]] $650 of expenses on her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Pro Tips for Maximizing Claims

*   **Accompanied Person**: If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanied person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Record Keeping**: Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

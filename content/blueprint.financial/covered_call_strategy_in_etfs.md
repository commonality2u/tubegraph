A covered call strategy is a unique approach used by some Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to enhance income [00:02:55]. This strategy involves an ETF investing in high-dividend stocks while simultaneously selling call options on some of its holdings [00:02:49].

## How Covered Calls Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>

In essence, a covered call ETF like ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks to generate extra income, also known as premiums [00:03:10]. This extra income is gained in exchange for capping potential gains [00:03:12].

*   **When Stock Prices Stay Flat or Fall:** If stock prices remain stable or decline, the ETF keeps the premium as profit, which boosts its dividend yield [00:03:17].
*   **When Stock Prices Rise:** If stock prices increase above a predetermined "strike price," the ETF is obligated to sell those shares at the set price, thereby missing out on any larger gains from the price appreciation [00:03:26].

Ultimately, an ETF employing a covered call strategy trades potential capital growth for more stable, high-yield income [00:03:32].

## Key Features of Covered Call ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>

*   **Enhanced Income Strategy:** Covered calls generate additional income, leading to a higher-than-average dividend yield [00:03:42]. For example, ZWC had a dividend yield of 6.62% as of February 27th, 2025, which is higher than average due to this strategy [00:03:58].
*   **Monthly Distributions:** These ETFs typically provide monthly dividend distributions, making them ideal for income-focused investors or retirees [00:03:46].
*   **Diversified Portfolio:** Covered call ETFs can hold a diversified portfolio of stocks, often concentrated in sectors like financials and energy [00:03:50].

## Performance and Costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>

ETFs utilizing covered calls often have higher management expense ratios (MERs) due to the active management of options [00:04:17]. For instance, ZWC has an MER of 0.72% and a trading expense ratio of 0.2%, totaling 0.92%, making it one of the more expensive ETFs [00:04:25].

## Who Should Invest? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

Covered call ETFs are best suited for:
*   **Retirees and Income Seekers:** They prioritize consistent cash flow [00:04:57].
*   **[[contribution_strategies_for_investments | RSP]] and [[options_trading_strategies_in_tfsa | TFSA]] Investors** who do not require long-term capital growth [00:05:02].

> [!WARNING] Not Ideal For Growth Investors
> Covered call strategies inherently limit potential capital gains, making them unsuitable for investors focused on long-term growth [00:05:07]. The strategy caps growth potential [00:04:51] and limits upside potential [00:05:17].

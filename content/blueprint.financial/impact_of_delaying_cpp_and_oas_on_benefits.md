Many Canadians consider the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) as primary sources of retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While relying solely on these benefits can be challenging, understanding the [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | impact of delaying CPP and OAS collection]] can significantly increase your monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout is directly tied to your lifetime earnings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Achieving the [[maximum_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_different_scenarios | maximum amount]] requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Benefits of Delaying CPP

Delaying your CPP collection can lead to substantially higher monthly benefits. The following figures represent CPP payouts in 2025 at different ages:

*   **Starting at Age 60:**
    *   Average monthly payment: approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: about $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 65:**
    *   Average monthly payment: approximately $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 70:**
    *   Average monthly payment: $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: approximately $2,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

The key takeaway is that taking CPP early significantly reduces your monthly payment, while waiting until age 70 can boost your benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not dependent on employment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Delaying OAS

The amount of OAS you receive can vary based on residency, income, and whether you choose to defer your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **Maximum Monthly Payments (as of March 2025):**
    *   Ages 65 to 74: $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
    *   Ages 75 and older: $800 (a 10% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed and adjusted quarterly (January, April, July, and October) based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. There is an automatic 10% increase in the OAS pension at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Strategies to Delay CPP and OAS for Higher Benefits

Delaying the collection of both CPP and OAS is a key strategy for increasing your retirement income:

*   **CPP:** Grows by 42% by delaying it to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **OAS:** Increases by 36% through delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

However, it's crucial to be able to afford delaying these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

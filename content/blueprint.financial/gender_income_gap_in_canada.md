## Gender Income Gap in Canada

In Canada, a notable disparity exists between the incomes of men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Understanding this gap is crucial for evaluating financial standing and economic equity.

### Statistical Overview (2022)

In 2022, a significant income gap was observed between men and women in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>:
*   **Men**:
    *   Average income: $66,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>
    *   Median income: $49,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>
*   **Women**:
    *   Average income: $48,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>
    *   Median income: $37,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>

This translates to men earning a 36% higher average income and a 32% higher median income compared to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Contributing Factors

Several factors contribute to the gender income gap in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>:
*   **Occupational Segregation**: Men often work in higher-paying fields like finance and engineering, while women are more frequently found in lower-paying sectors such as education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Work Hours and Career Interruptions**: Men tend to work more full-time hours and experience fewer career interruptions, which positively impacts their overall earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Systemic Barriers**: Biases in hiring and promotions act as systemic barriers, making it more challenging for women to advance their careers and increase their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Negotiation Practices**: Men are often more likely to negotiate for higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Salary Transparency**: A lack of transparency surrounding salaries can help perpetuate the existing gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

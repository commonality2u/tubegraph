## Factors Contributing to the Gender Income Gap

Several factors contribute to the persistent gender income gap in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:

*   **Occupational Segregation:** Men frequently work in higher-paying sectors such as finance and engineering, while women are more often employed in lower-paying fields like education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Work Patterns:** Men tend to work more full-time hours and experience fewer career interruptions, which positively impacts their overall earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Systemic Barriers:** Biases in hiring and promotion processes can hinder women's career advancement and earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Negotiation and Transparency:** Men are generally more inclined to negotiate for higher pay. Additionally, a lack of transparency regarding salaries can perpetuate the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Addressing the Gap

To address the gender pay gap, women might consider strategies such as negotiating pay more aggressively or targeting industries that are actively working to close this disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

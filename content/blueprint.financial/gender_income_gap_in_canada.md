In Canada, there is a notable disparity in income between men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Understanding this gap involves examining income statistics, identifying contributing factors, and considering potential strategies to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Income by Gender (2022)

In 2022, a significant income gap was observed between men and women in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>:
*   **Men** earned an average of $66,000, with a median income of $49,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Women** earned an average of $48,500, with a median income of $37,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This means that men had a 36% higher average income and a 32% higher median income compared to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Gender Income Gap

Several factors contribute to the persistent gender income gap in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
*   **Occupational Segregation**
    *   Men frequently work in higher-paying sectors such as finance and engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   Women are more commonly found in lower-paying industries like education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Working Hours and Career Interruptions**
    *   Men tend to work more full-time hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   Men also experience fewer career interruptions, which helps boost their overall earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Systemic Barriers**
    *   Biases in hiring and promotion processes make it harder for women to advance in their careers and increase their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Negotiation and Transparency**
    *   Men are more likely to negotiate for higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   A lack of transparency regarding salaries can help maintain the existing gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Addressing the Gender Pay Gap

While there is no simple solution, women might consider negotiating pay more aggressively or targeting industries that are actively working to close this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

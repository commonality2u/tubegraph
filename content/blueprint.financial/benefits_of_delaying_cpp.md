Delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) can be a significant financial decision for retirement, potentially boosting your monthly benefit considerably compared to starting it early at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Reasons to Delay CPP

There are several key reasons why [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying your CPP]] might be a beneficial strategy:

### 1. Significantly Higher Monthly Payouts
The most apparent reason to [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delay your CPP]] is the increased monthly payout you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Baseline at 65**: If you start CPP at age 65, you receive the baseline amount, for example, $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Starting at 60**: Starting at age 60 reduces benefits by 0.6% per month, leading to a 36% overall reduction compared to age 65, resulting in a lower payment of $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Delaying to 70**: Delaying to age 70 increases benefits by 0.7% per month, totaling a 42% increase over starting at age 65, leading to a higher payment of $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Delaying CPP to age 70 can more than double your monthly benefit compared to [[cpp_early_withdrawal_versus_delaying_benefits | starting it at age 60]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### 2. Sufficient Income or Savings
If you possess enough income or savings to sustain yourself until age 70, delaying CPP is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Drawing from a solid retirement savings portfolio (including RRSPs, TFSAs, or workplace pensions) can cover expenses from ages 60 to 70 while allowing investments to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The increased CPP payments commencing at age 70 provide a significant boost to retirement income, enhancing long-term financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### 3. Good Health and Life Expectancy
If you are in good [[impact_of_health_on_cpp_decision | health]] and expect to live longer, delaying CPP can be a great choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. A 60-year-old in Canada today is expected to live to about 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Since CPP payments, once started, last for life, a longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] makes the higher delayed payments more beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The break-even point for earning more by delaying from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 4. Inflation Protection
CPP payments are indexed to inflation, meaning they increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The longer you delay, the larger your inflation-indexed CPP payments will be, offering a unique and special pension benefit not commonly found in other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### 5. Confidence in CPP Management
Concerns about the CPP running out of money are largely unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Strong Contributions**: CPP contributions are projected to grow significantly, from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 for the base CPP, and from $9.3 billion to $45 billion for the additional CPP over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Regular Reviews**: The CPP undergoes independent peer reviews, with the latest report confirming its financial sustainability for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Solid Investment Returns**: As per the 2023 annual report, the CPP's investment portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### 6. Avoiding OAS Clawback
Delaying CPP can help manage your overall income to avoid the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. OAS payments can be up to $784 per month, but they are subject to clawback if your income exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $90,995 as of recent figures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. By delaying CPP, you might keep your income below this threshold during the years you receive OAS, allowing you to retain more of your OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Example**: Simon's total annual income after age 70, even with delayed CPP benefits of $21,000 per year, is $81,000, which is below the OAS clawback threshold, meaning he keeps all his OAS and benefits from larger CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### 7. Not Requiring Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from other sources (RRSPs, pensions), you likely won't qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In such cases, delaying CPP to receive larger payments won't impact your GIS eligibility, as you wouldn't qualify for it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 8. RRSP Tax Planning
Delaying CPP can be a strategic move for RRSP tax planning, especially if you aim to draw down your RRSP faster between ages 60 and 70 to minimize taxes upon death and leave more for your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Example**: If annual living expenses are $40,000, you could withdraw this amount from your RRSP annually from 60 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. At age 70, with $21,000 in annual CPP benefits, you would only need an additional $19,000 from other sources, leading to less tax paid upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### 9. Still Working in Your 60s
If you plan to continue working into your 60s or 70s, delaying CPP makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **No Immediate Need**: You likely won't need the CPP income early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Continued Contributions**: You would still need to make CPP contributions from age 60 to 65 even if you started receiving benefits early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Higher Returns**: The benefit from [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] is likely greater than the returns from investing early CPP payments, as it's difficult to achieve such an increase purely through market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### 10. More Predictable and Stable Income
Delaying CPP allows you to trade uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. By using savings like RRSPs or TFSAs to cover expenses between 60 and 65, you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for the rest of your life starting at age 65 (or 70 if delayed further), reducing reliance on fluctuating market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Conclusion
While there are many compelling reasons to delay CPP, the optimal decision regarding [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision | when to take CPP]] is highly personal and depends on your unique financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

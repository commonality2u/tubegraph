A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is considered one of the most effective tools to help [[strategies_to_avoid_tfsa_penalties | avoid the OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This is because [[managing_taxefficient_withdrawals_from_a_tfsa | withdrawals from a TFSA]] are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## How TFSA Withdrawals Impact Taxable Income

By utilizing a TFSA, individuals can access funds for living expenses without increasing their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This helps them stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

For instance, if you have $100,000 saved in your TFSA and withdraw $20,000 per year for living expenses, this amount will not be taxed and will not be counted as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This strategy is particularly useful if your taxable income is already close to the OAS clawback threshold of $90,995 (for the 2024 income year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. By using your TFSA for additional income, you avoid pushing your taxable income higher, allowing you to remain under the threshold and preserve your full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

In contrast, if the same $20,000 had to be withdrawn from a taxable account like an RRSP, your income could exceed the threshold, which would trigger the clawback and reduce your OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The key benefit of a TFSA is its flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. It provides the ability to access tax-free income and protect OAS benefits, making it an [[using_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | essential tool for retirees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

> Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing these funds to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This approach keeps your taxable income lower in later years and allows for tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA during retirement, thereby minimizing the clawback effect on your OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

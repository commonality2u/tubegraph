The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can penalize and tax your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) if it determines you are operating a business within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This means your TFSA ceases to be truly tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## How a TFSA Can Be Classified as a Business

The CRA scrutinizes trading patterns and may decide that certain activities constitute a business rather than simple investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. If a TFSA is deemed a business, all income generated becomes taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, effectively removing its tax-free status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Case Study: Fared Ahamed

Fared Ahamed, an investment advisor, opened his TFSA in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. He engaged in high-volume trading, primarily with penny stocks, and frequently flipped stocks, sometimes holding them for only hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. He managed to grow his initial contribution into over $600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

However, the CRA determined that the nature and frequency of his trades indicated he was operating a business within his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As a result, his $617,000 was reclassified as taxable business income, leading to significant tax bills and potential penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Ahamed's appeal was unsuccessful, making his case a [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investment | cautionary tale]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Why the CRA Cares About Day Trading

Day trading involves rapid buying and selling of assets to profit from small price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The CRA does not consider this activity to be consistent with the intended purpose of a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Factors the CRA considers when evaluating trading patterns include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   Frequency of trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   Short holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Use of expert strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Use of borrowed funds (leverage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

The CRA typically only takes notice of day trading activities if they are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Once a TFSA is considered a business, every dollar earned becomes taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## How to Avoid Being Classified as a Business

The CRA does not provide a specific set of rules (e.g., number of trades per month) to define what constitutes "too much trading" in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Each case is evaluated individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

To remain on the CRA's good side and ensure your TFSA maintains its tax-free status, it is important to err on the side of caution and apply common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The key is to use your TFSA as a long-term investing and savings vehicle, not a day trading platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Consider the following practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>:
*   **Long-Term Investments** Stick to investments you intend to hold for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Examples include Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Blue Chip stocks, or bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Avoid Frequent Trading** Refrain from frequently buying and selling stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Do Not Use Leverage** Avoid using borrowed funds for investments within your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

By using your TFSA wisely, you can avoid the complications and penalties associated with having it reclassified as a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

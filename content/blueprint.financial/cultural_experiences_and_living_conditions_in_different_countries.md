Canadians are increasingly considering moving abroad, with nearly 40% of new Canadians contemplating leaving their province or even the country due to skyrocketing living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The decision to move involves balancing strategic planning with personal comfort, acknowledging that compromises are part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. There is no "perfect" country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, so understanding what matters most to an individual is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## [[criteria_for_choosing_countries_to_live_abroad | Key Factors for Choosing a Country]]

When considering moving abroad, several factors influence the choice of location, focusing on [[criteria_for_choosing_countries_to_live_abroad | living conditions]] and [[cultural experiences and living conditions in different countries | cultural integration]]:

*   **Healthcare**: Access to good doctors and hospitals, and assurance of health insurance coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **[[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | Cost of Living]]**: Understanding expenses for housing, groceries, and daily living to avoid financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Safety**: Assessment of crime rates, political stability, and natural disaster concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Job Market**: Crucial for those job hunting or planning to work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **[[visa_and_residency_options_in_various_countries | Visa and Citizenship]]**: Ease of obtaining and maintaining a visa, and long-term citizenship processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Income and property tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Weather**: Climate considerations, often seeking warmer, sunnier places than Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

It's recommended to choose three to five priority factors to evaluate potential countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, some might prioritize healthcare, [[cost_of_living_comparisons_for_retirees_in_canada_vs_other_countries | cost of living]], and safety, considering countries like Spain, Portugal, and New Zealand due to their strong healthcare, lower living costs than Canada, and solid safety records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Conversely, countries like Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico might be avoided due to inconsistent healthcare, varying living costs, and safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

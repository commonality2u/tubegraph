Trading fees and the bid-ask spread are significant hidden costs that can erode investment returns, particularly for active traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. These costs arise from the act of buying and selling investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Brokerage Fees

Many Canadian brokerage firms impose a flat fee per trade, typically ranging from $5 to $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This means an additional charge is incurred every time a stock or Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is bought or sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. For frequent traders, these fees can accumulate rapidly; for instance, making 10 trades per month at $9.99 each amounts to nearly $1,200 annually in fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Some actively managed mutual funds may also charge short-term trading fees if units are sold within a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. These are related to [[early_redemption_fees_on_mutual_funds | early redemption fees]].

## Bid-Ask Spread

Another hidden cost of trading is the bid-ask spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (the bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (the ask) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

For example, if an ETF is bought at the ask price of $20.10 and later sold at the bid price of $20, there is a loss of $0.10 per share due to the spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The impact of the bid-ask spread is more pronounced with lower volume stocks and ETFs, which tend to have wider spreads, making them more expensive to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce Trading Fees

To minimize the impact of trading fees and bid-ask spreads:
*   **Utilize Low-Cost or Commission-Free Brokers** Consider platforms like Wealthsimple Trade or Questrade, which offer low-cost or commission-free trading for ETFs and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Minimize Frequent Trading** Adopting a long-term investment strategy can reduce the number of transactions and, consequently, the fees incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Use Limit Orders** Instead of market orders, which execute at the current market price, limit orders allow investors to control the buy and sell pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Trade High-Volume Assets** Focusing on high-volume ETFs and stocks can help reduce losses from the bid-ask spread, as these assets typically have narrower spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

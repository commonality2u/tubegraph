Canada has international social security agreements with numerous countries, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Approximately 50 countries currently have such agreements with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Benefits
These agreements can help individuals qualify for [[old_age_security_pension_and_its_implications | Old Age Security (OAS)]] or [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] benefits, even if they haven't spent the full required time living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Specifically, they allow Canada to count time spent in certain other countries towards the 10 or 20-year residency minimums for OAS eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

For example, if someone lived in Canada for 7 years and the UK for 13 years, they might still qualify for OAS under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. These agreements can help you qualify for partial OAS or CPP benefits even if you haven't lived in Canada for the full 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Countries like the UK, India, the Philippines, and many in Europe are on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Limitations
It is important to note that while these agreements help meet residency minimums, they do not count towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS. Therefore, individuals will likely receive only a partial OAS benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

Furthermore, international agreements or tax treaties do not protect [[guaranteed_income_supplement_eligibility_and_benefits | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. GIS is strictly tied to living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Planning for Retirement
Individuals considering retirement abroad should check if their planned destination country has a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. If close to the 20-year OAS threshold for portability and planning to retire in a country without an agreement, it might be beneficial to delay moving for a couple of years to secure more benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This strategic delay could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra benefits over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

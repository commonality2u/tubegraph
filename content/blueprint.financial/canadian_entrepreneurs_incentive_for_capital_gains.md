The Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI) is a significant tax measure providing [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | tax relief for business owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. It reduces the [[potential_outcomes_for_canadas_capital_gains_tax | capital gains tax]] inclusion rate to one-third (33.33%) on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible [[potential_outcomes_for_canadas_capital_gains_tax | capital gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Phased Implementation
The CEI is being phased in gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The limit increases by $400,000 annually, with the full $2 million cap expected to be reached by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## How it Works
Consider a small business owner with a $100,000 taxable capital gain:
> Under the CEI, only $33,600 would be included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Without the CEI, $66,500 would be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## CEI vs. Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)
While the CEI reduces the inclusion rate, it does not affect investment income taxation, which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. For many business owners, the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) often remains a more effective tool, particularly when multiple shareholders are involved, because it offers a complete exemption for eligible [[potential_outcomes_for_canadas_capital_gains_tax | capital gains]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Strategic allocation of gains across shareholders can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without solely relying on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Nuanced Tax Planning
> Combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This is a very nuanced area of [[tax_planning_strategies_for_canadian_families_and_business_owners | tax planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

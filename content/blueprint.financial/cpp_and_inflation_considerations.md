Many individuals express concern about the [[impact_of_inflation_on_cpp_beneficiaries | impact of inflation]] on their retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. In recent years, Canada has experienced significantly high inflation, leading to increased costs for everyday expenses such as groceries, rent, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## CPP as an Inflation Hedge
A key feature of the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] is its indexing to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This means that [[CPP cost of living adjustments | CPP]] payouts are designed to increase over time, helping to maintain purchasing power in line with the rising [[cpp_cost_of_living_adjustments | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. This mechanism supports retirees during periods of higher living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

For example, in 2024, the [[cpp_cost_of_living_increase_in_2025 | CPP]] rate saw an increase of 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Delaying CPP
Delaying the start of [[cpp_and_income_planning | CPP]] payments can lead to higher inflation-indexed benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This is because the longer payments are deferred, the greater the base amount that will be subject to these inflation adjustments over the recipient's lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

The indexing feature makes [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp | CPP]] a unique and valuable pension, as there are not many other investments that offer similar inflation protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. By delaying [[cpp_and_income_planning | CPP]], individuals can secure a higher, inflation-adjusted payment for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:41">[01:12:41]</a>.

Upon death, an entire Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance is added to the deceased's income for that year and taxed at the highest marginal tax rate in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This can result in a significant portion of the RRSP disappearing to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. For example, if an RRSP has a balance of $700,000 at the time of death, the full $700,000 is added to the income and taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. In Ontario, this could push the income into the highest tax bracket of 53%, resulting in a tax bill of $371,000, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Fortunately, there are effective strategies to minimize this tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Five Strategies to Minimize RRSP Tax on Death

Here are five strategies, ordered from easiest to hardest, to minimize the tax on RRSPs upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>:

### 1. Spousal Rollover

This strategy allows for the tax-free transfer of an entire RRSP balance to a spouse or common-law partner's RRSP or RRIF upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This defers immediate taxes, allowing the surviving spouse to defer paying taxes until they start withdrawing the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Michael's Spousal Rollover
> Michael passes away with an RRSP balance of $700,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Instead of being taxed at 53%, the $700,000 is transferred tax-free to his wife Emily's RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Emily will not pay taxes until she begins making withdrawals from the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Immediate tax deferral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Gives the surviving spouse control over when to withdraw funds, potentially leading to future tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Only applicable if there is a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Taxes are deferred, not eliminated; they will still be due when the spouse starts withdrawing or when they pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   This is a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### 2. RRSP Rollovers for Dependent Children

In specific situations, an RRSP can be transferred tax-free to a dependent child or grandchild, typically if they are financially dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] David's Rollover to Granddaughter
> David passes away with a $500,000 RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. His 17-year-old granddaughter Lily qualifies as a dependent due to her disability, so the RRSP is transferred to her tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Without this rollover, $500,000 would be taxed at 53%, leaving only $235,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Lily won't owe taxes until she starts making withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Avoids immediate taxes if the dependent child qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   Provides financial support for children or grandchildren in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Strict rules apply; the child must be dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   Not available for most adult children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### 3. Convert to a RRIF for Early Structured Withdrawals

Instead of risking a large tax hit upon death, individuals can convert their RRSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) once they retire and begin making structured withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This approach allows managing the annual withdrawal amount, spreading it over multiple years to maintain a lower taxable income bracket and reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This is one of the key [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RRSP withdrawal strategies]] and [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | tax-efficient RRSP withdrawal strategies]].

> [!EXAMPLE] David's Gradual RRIF Withdrawals
> David retires at 65 with $600,000 in his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. He converts his RRSP to a RRIF and withdraws $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This keeps him within a manageable tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. If he had waited, his RRSP could have grown, pushing him into the top tax bracket and resulting in up to 53% going to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Gradual withdrawals minimize taxes year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Smooths out the tax bill over several years, avoiding a lump-sum tax hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   Allows for better tax planning by providing control over annual withdrawal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Taxes are still due on withdrawals, even in smaller amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   Requires careful planning to avoid withdrawing too much, which could lead to a higher tax bracket or deplete the RRSP too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 4. RRSP Withdrawal to Pay for Life Insurance

To protect an RRSP from a large tax hit upon death, a permanent life insurance policy can be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The tax-free payout from the policy covers the tax bill, ensuring loved ones receive the full value of the RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Small, gradual RRSP withdrawals can be used to pay the life insurance premiums, spreading out the tax burden and making payments manageable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] John and Mary's Life Insurance Strategy
> John (72) and Mary (70) have a joint RRSP of $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. To prevent a potential half-million tax bill, they bought a joint last-to-die permanent life insurance policy with a minimum death benefit of $632,000, designed to cover the entire tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. They withdrew $50,000 annually from their RRSP for six years to cover the premiums, spreading the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. After six years, the policy was fully paid up and grew to over $777,000 ten years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This payout covered the estate's entire tax bill for the RRSPs, plus extra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Double Benefit:** The insurance payout is completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Using RRSP withdrawals reduces the RRSP balance, lowering the final tax hit at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   Effectively trades RRSP income for tax-free growth within the life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   Avoids large upfront payments from existing assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   Policy can be fully paid up after a few years, with continued tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Not everyone qualifies for life insurance, especially those with pre-existing health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   Annual RRSP withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially increasing tax liability during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   Requires careful planning to avoid excessive tax due to withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### 5. RRSP Income Splitting

In this strategy, the higher-earning spouse contributes to a spousal RRSP in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The lower-income spouse can then withdraw these funds gradually in retirement, lowering the overall RRSP balance and reducing the large tax hit when the RRSP holder passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. This contributes to [[strategies_for_maximizing_retirement_income | Strategies for maximizing retirement income]] and overall [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Retirement Tax Strategies in Canada]].

> [!EXAMPLE] Mark and Susan's Income Splitting
> Mark is in a 45% tax bracket, while his wife Susan will be in a 20% tax bracket when she retires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Mark contributes $20,000 annually to Susan's spousal RRSP, receiving a tax deduction for his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In retirement, Susan withdraws $40,000 per year from her spousal RRSP, taxed at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This approach reduces the overall balance of Mark's RRSP, leading to a much smaller tax hit on death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

*   **Pros:**
    *   Reduces the RRSP balance at death by shifting withdrawals to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   Allows for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement, lowering the tax hit during life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   Only effective if one spouse is in a significantly lower income bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   Requires careful planning and consistent contributions to the spousal RRSP over time for maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Bonus Strategy: Individual Pension Plan (IPP) for Business Owners

An Individual Pension Plan (IPP) offers a tax-efficient way for business owners to transfer wealth to the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Unlike an RRSP, which is fully taxed as income upon death, an IPP allows children to be added to the plan, effectively passing it on to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The IPP is taken over by the children, avoiding the large immediate tax hit of an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. They are only taxed as they withdraw funds, spreading the tax liability over many years and generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Paul's IPP for His Children
> Paul, a business owner, transfers his $500,000 RRSP funds into an IPP and contributes more via his corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The IPP grows to $1.5 million over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Paul then adds his two children, Jason and Emma, as IPP members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. When Paul passes away, Jason and Emma take over the IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. They are not immediately taxed on the full balance, but only as they withdraw funds, allowing them to control the tax impact and potentially remain in lower tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Defers Taxation:** Spreads the tax liability over many years as children make withdrawals, unlike an RRSP's immediate taxation on death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
    *   **Lower Tax Impact:** Gradual withdrawals allow beneficiaries to stay in lower tax brackets, reducing total taxes owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Tax-Efficient Wealth Transfer:** IPP passes to children without an immediate tax, preserving the full value of the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **IPP Management:** Beneficiaries need to manage the IPP and ensure withdrawals suit their income and corporate situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   **Corporate Involvement:** Children must be employed by the business and receive T4 income to participate in the IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Running Multiple RRSP Strategies

Just as a house needs a strong foundation, walls, and a roof, a solid financial plan benefits from combining multiple strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Layering these approaches can drastically reduce taxes during one's lifetime and when passing an estate to loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This is a crucial aspect of [[utilizing_tfsa_and_rrsp_for_taxefficient_retirement | utilizing TFSA and RRSP for tax-efficient retirement]].

> [!TIP] Common Blueprint for Combined Strategies
> Jerry and Kim combine three strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>:
> 1.  **Spousal RRSP & Gradual Withdrawals:** Jerry contributes to Kim's spousal RRSP, and Kim withdraws at a lower tax rate in retirement (similar to [[effective_rrsp_contribution_strategies | effective RRSP contribution strategies]] and [[challenges_with_rrsp_withdrawals_in_retirement | challenges with RRSP withdrawals in retirement]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
> 2.  **Gradual Withdrawals:** Jerry also makes gradual RRSP withdrawals to spread out his tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
> 3.  **Life Insurance:** To further protect their estate, they purchase life insurance to cover taxes owed on Jerry's RRSP after he passes, ensuring their children inherit the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Jerry uses his gradual RRSP withdrawals to cover the insurance premiums, further reducing the tax hit by effectively trading RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

This combined strategy smooths out their tax burden and maximizes the inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

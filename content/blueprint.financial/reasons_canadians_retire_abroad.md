A significant number of Canadians, totaling 106,000 in 2024, have permanently left the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are not merely seeking warmer climates but are driven by a desire to escape high costs and taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This has led some to choose to [[top_countries_for_canadian_retirees | retire abroad]] for a better financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## [[reasons_for_leaving_canada_and_rising_cost_of_living | High Costs and Taxes in Canada]]

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives approximately $1,300 to $1,500 per month combined from [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP and OAS]] if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income often falls short of covering basic living expenses. For instance, in Toronto, a one-bedroom apartment averages about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. When factoring in utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150), a modest lifestyle for someone who doesn't own a home easily exceeds $3,000 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Numbeo data supports this, estimating a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, and $3,500 to $4,000 per month modestly with a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This means [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP]] and OAS payments barely cover a third of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, making retirement in Canada feel financially unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Financial Security and Longevity of Savings

The high cost of living in Canada can quickly deplete retirement savings. A simulated case study for a retiree named Seth illustrates this:
*   **Seth's Situation in Toronto**: Seth retires at 65 in 2025 with $281,000 in net worth after taxes, spending $50,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. He relies on CPP and OAS for about $18,000 annually, with the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   By age 70, his TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   By age 72, he's solely relying on RRSP withdrawals, over $46,000 a year, facing effective tax rates above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   By age 74, he's out of savings, and by 76, his net worth turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
    *   His costs were simply too high for his savings to sustain, even with modest living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Moving to a country with a lower [[cost_of_living_comparison_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | cost of living]] can dramatically alter a retiree's financial outlook, allowing their money to stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Top Countries for Canadian Retirees

Many Canadians are choosing to [[top_countries_for_canadian_retirees | retire abroad]] to improve their financial situation and lifestyle.

### Mexico
Mexico is a top choice for Canadians seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild, spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper (e.g., 20% of Canadian prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Private insurance is essential as public healthcare is not usually available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities make visits easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, and bureaucracy requires patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Some Spanish language skills are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Seth's Situation in Cancun**: With average monthly expenses (including rent) around $1,700 CAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> ($20,000 annually), Seth's CPP and OAS could cover most costs, and his portfolio would grow substantially, reaching over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal appeals to those seeking a laid-back European lifestyle with old-world charm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers, with beach weather nearly year-round in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with access to the public system for residents and affordable private care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The D7 passive income visa requires steady income from sources like [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]], pensions, or investments, needing about €870 per month ($1,400 CAD) to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Accessibility**: Direct flights from Lisbon and Porto to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: Falls between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In Porto, rent might be $1,300/month, and other expenses $1,700, totaling around $3,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> ($36,000 annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Seth's Situation in Porto**: With $36,000 annual expenses and $18,000 from CPP/OAS, Seth's savings would deplete by age 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While better than Toronto, it still wasn't enough to sustain him until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Thailand
Thailand offers excellent value for Canadian retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Diverse options from cooler mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) or city energy (Bangkok), with a well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded in Asia, with many English-speaking doctors and excellent private hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Retirement visa requires being 50 or older and showing 800,000 Thai Baht (approx. $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can be $1,200-$1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For someone with $1,500/month from CPP/OAS, this could cover most basic needs, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay
Paraguay is an emerging option, particularly due to its tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions are not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asunción, living expenses are about $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Total living costs can be just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Residency**: Offers relatively simple ways to obtain a permanent residency visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Spain
Spain provides a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,057, with a city-center one-bedroom rent at $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Total monthly expenses range from $2,400 to $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, which is cheaper than parts of Portugal and comparable to some parts of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The non-lucrative visa for Canadians requires about $40,000 to $45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[0:10:27]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Canadians Retiring Abroad

While appealing, retiring abroad requires careful [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | planning]].
*   **OAS Payments**: Canadians risk losing OAS payments if they retire abroad without meeting specific residency rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
    *   If applying while living in Canada, only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
    *   However, if living outside Canada, 20 years of residency are required to continue receiving long-term payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
    *   If a retiree has between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, they might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless they move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. For example, David, with 15 years residency, lost his OAS after 6 months in Thailand because Thailand lacks such an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Financial Planning**:
    *   Do not rely solely on [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | CPP]] and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
    *   Account for inflation, currency shifts, and unexpected healthcare costs, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   Consider the seven tax traps to avoid when leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Life abroad isn't for everyone; factors like distance from family, new systems, and language barriers can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Resources**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs like rent, food, and utilities in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

A low-cost retirement can be rewarding, but it must be supported by a solid [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | financial plan]] to avoid [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | income challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

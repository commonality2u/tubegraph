Car depreciation is a critical factor when deciding whether to buy, lease, or finance a vehicle, as it significantly influences the overall cost of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. The value of a new car begins to "melt away" in its first few years, much like a massive chunk of an iceberg hidden beneath the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Importance of Estimating Depreciation

Estimating car depreciation is considered the "most important number" in car buying calculators because it "really moves the needle" on whether to [[pros_and_cons_of_leasing_vs_buying_vs_financing_a_car | lease or buy]] a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The annual depreciation rate directly determines the actual market resale value of the car at the end of the term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

## Methods for Estimating Depreciation

There are several methods to estimate a car's depreciation each year, ranging from easiest to more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>:

### 1. Research Average Depreciation Rates
New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year and an additional 15% each year for the subsequent four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. This method is often used for general examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### 2. Use Online Depreciation Estimators
Websites such as Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book offer free tools to estimate a car's depreciation based on its make, model, year, and mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### 3. Check Current Marketplaces
This hands-on method involves checking current listings for a specific car's make, model, and year on sites like AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This approach provides real-time insight into the car's current value and how much it has depreciated, showing exactly what cars are being listed and sold for, rather than just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

## Impact on Car Buying and Leasing Decisions

The annual depreciation rate is a major variable that can significantly swing the decision between buying and leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

*   **High Resale Value**: If a vehicle is projected to have a high resale value (meaning lower depreciation), buying or financing is generally more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. For instance, if annual depreciation is low (e.g., 10%), the net cost of buying decreases greatly, making it much better than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value**: If a vehicle is expected to have a low resale value (meaning higher depreciation), leasing becomes more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. If annual depreciation is high (e.g., 25%), the net cost of buying can significantly increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

However, accurately predicting the market resale value is challenging because it heavily depends on supply and demand at that specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Market fluctuations, such as the shortage of cars during the COVID-19 pandemic, can drastically alter used car prices, impacting whether owning or leasing would have been more advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

## Depreciation and Used Car Purchases

Buying a used car is often considered the smartest financial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. By buying cars in the "sweet spot" of 3 to 5 years old, consumers can avoid this initial depreciation hit and get more value for their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. Cars in this age range typically haven't developed many major issues yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Additionally, used cars usually have lower insurance costs and less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>.

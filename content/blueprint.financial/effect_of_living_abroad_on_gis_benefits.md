The [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] is a vital financial support for many low-income Canadian seniors, potentially adding up to approximately $13,000 per year tax-free on top of their [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | Old Age Security (OAS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, for immigrants and Canadians considering retiring abroad, there are specific rules regarding [[gis_portability_and_residency_requirements | GIS portability and residency requirements]] that can significantly impact their entitlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## GIS Portability and Residency Requirements

A critical point for recipients of the [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] is that it is *only* paid while the individual is living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### The Six-Month Rule

If a [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] recipient leaves Canada for more than six consecutive months, their [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] payments will be cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This cessation of benefits occurs even if the individual's income remains low enough to qualify and they continue filing Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Impact on Immigrants

This rule particularly impacts immigrants who may have plans to retire back in their home country or in a more affordable nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] is a part of their expected retirement income, such a move could result in the loss of thousands of dollars per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

For instance, a 71-year-old retiree named Jane moved to Mexico to be closer to family and stretch her pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While her Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments continued, her [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] stopped after six months, as she was unaware that leaving Canada meant losing this benefit completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### No Workaround or International Agreements

There is currently no workaround, international agreement, or tax treaty that will protect [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] is strictly tied to living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Strategies for Maintaining GIS While Abroad

Despite the strict residency rules, some retirees utilize a "snowbird strategy" to maintain their [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] and other benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This involves staying in Canada for at least 183 days a year, while spending the remaining time in a warmer country like Florida or Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This strategy may not be suitable for everyone but can be effective with careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Planning for Retirement Abroad

If an immigrant is considering retiring abroad, they will need a backup financial plan, as the [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] will not follow them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Building personal retirement income through Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), and other personal savings is crucial, especially if government benefits like [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] are expected to be lower or cease entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Understanding the [[key_factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | residency rules before leaving]] Canada is paramount to avoid unexpected loss of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

> [!warning]
> If you are an immigrant who arrived in Canada later in life, or if you plan to retire abroad, you might only receive a fraction of potential government benefits, or even lose your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | OAS]] and [[guaranteed_income_supplement_gis | GIS]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This can lead to a massive difference in retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

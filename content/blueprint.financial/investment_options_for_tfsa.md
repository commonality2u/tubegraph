To reach a $1 million TFSA goal, it's crucial to select appropriate investments that balance risk and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The ideal approach avoids both extremely low-risk, low-return methods that take too long and extremely high-risk, high-reward methods that have a high chance of losing all your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The key is to find a "sweet spot" that is not too risky but still provides enough return to achieve your goal in a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

First, determine your risk tolerance, for example, by filling out a free online questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Then, choose the right [[Investment Strategies for TFSA | investments]] that align with your risk tolerance and contribute regularly to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Investments to Avoid

### Mutual Funds at Big Banks
While convenient and easy to set up, mutual funds offered by big banks often come with very high fees, sometimes topping 3% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. These high fees significantly reduce your investment gains, making them generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Recommended Investment Options

### Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
ETFs are a good choice for keeping costs down as they typically mirror the performance of a market index, allowing you to earn returns close to the market you invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Popular providers in Canada include Vanguard and iShares, known for their low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, ETFs expose you to market volatility, and you'll need basic knowledge of trading since they are bought and sold on stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Individual Stocks
Investing in individual stocks offers ultimate control over your [[TFSA Investment Strategies | investments]] with the lowest fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. You can choose specific companies to invest in and decide when to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. A dividend stock strategy can provide both potential capital appreciation and regular income from company earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This method requires significant market knowledge and dedicated time to manage your portfolio effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Greater control often comes with increased risk, especially if your choices are not diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Robo Advisors
Robo advisors are automated platforms that manage your [[Strategies for Maximizing TFSA Growth | investments]] using algorithms designed to align with your financial goals and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Well Simple and Questwealth are popular Canadian examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. They offer convenience and simplicity, making them appealing for new investors or those preferring a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. You can start with a relatively small amount, increasing accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

However, robo advisors lack the personal touch and deeper understanding of a human advisor, especially in complex financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Their algorithm-based operation might not fully capture unique investment opportunities or tailor strategies for your changing financial circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Portfolio Managers
For those who find managing their own [[Optimizing TFSA for Longterm Financial Goals | investments]] overwhelming, or prefer not to rely on algorithms, hiring a portfolio manager is an excellent option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. While traditionally an option for the wealthy, it is now accessible to almost anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. A professional manager can tailor your portfolio to specific needs and risk tolerance, optimizing your chances for success without daily hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

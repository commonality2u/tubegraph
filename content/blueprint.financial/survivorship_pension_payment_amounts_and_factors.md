The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) doesn't always end upon an individual's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead, a surviving spouse or family members may be eligible to receive a CPP survivorship pension, potentially up to $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_requirements | Eligibility for the CPP Survivorship Pension]]

To qualify for the CPP survivorship pension, there are two main requirements:

*   **Relationship Status**: The applicant must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **CPP Contributions**: The deceased must have contributed to CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for a total of at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Apply as Soon as Possible
> Make sure to apply for the survivorship pension promptly after your partner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond that period could result in a loss of entitled funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, if Emma is eligible for $700 a month and waits 18 months to apply, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## How Much Money Can You Receive?

The amount of CPP survivorship pension received depends on two key [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | factors]]:

1.  The survivor's age at the time of the spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  The amount the deceased spouse contributed to the CPP over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Calculation Scenarios (Example: John passed away at 65, receiving $1,200/month CPP)

The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of their actual age at passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **If the Survivor is Under 65 Years Old**:
    *   The survivor receives a flat rate amount ($227 in 2024) plus 37.5% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If John's pension was $1,200/month, Emma (under 65) would receive $450 (37.5% of $1,200) + $227, totaling $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **If the Survivor is 65 Years Old or Older**:
    *   The survivorship pension is recalculated, and the survivor receives up to 60% of the deceased's calculated pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If John's pension was $1,200/month, Emma (65 or older) would receive 60% of $1,200, totaling $720 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Average and Maximum Payments (Based on Real-Life Data)

*   **Survivor Under 65**:
    *   Average payment: $524 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Maximum payment: $739 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   This includes the flat rate and 37.5% of the deceased spouse's pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Survivor 65 or Older**:
    *   Average payment: $323 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   Maximum payment: $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   Survivors over 65 receive 60% of their spouse's pension without the flat rate portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The difference between average and maximum payments often indicates that many survivors do not receive the full pension, likely due to the deceased spouse's contribution history or the survivor's own CPP benefits affecting the payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Maximum payouts are only achievable if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## [[maximum_limits_and_how_personal_cpp_benefits_affect_survivorship_pension | Maximum Survivor Pension Cap Explained]]

There is a cap on the total CPP benefits an individual can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of the survivor's personal CPP benefits and the survivorship pension cannot exceed the maximum CPP retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Examples of Combined Benefits

*   **Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension**:
    *   Emma receives $800/month from her CPP retirement pension and qualifies for $700/month from John's survivorship pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   Combined total: $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Due to the retirement cap of $1,375 (for 2024), her benefits would be reduced to this cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Lower Retirement Pension**:
    *   Emma's CPP retirement pension is $400/month, and she qualifies for $600/month from John's survivorship pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Combined total: $1,000/month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Since this is below the cap, she would receive the full $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Disability Pension Combined with Survivorship Pension**:
    *   Emma receives $1,200/month from CPP disability benefits and qualifies for $500/month from John's survivorship pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Combined total: $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   Due to the combined Survivor and Disability Pension cap ($1,613 for 2024), her total benefits would be adjusted to $1,613 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Advanced Planning Strategies Around the CPP Cap

*   **Start CPP Early if Below the Cap**: If your CPP retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting CPP early can be a good option. This allows you to collect both your CPP and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If your CPP is $400/month and survivorship pension is $500/month, the combined $900 is well below the $1,375 retirement benefits cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Delay CPP if Near the Cap**: If your expected CPP is close to the maximum, delaying your CPP can maximize your overall benefit. This way, you receive a higher survivorship pension without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If your CPP at 65 is $1,000/month and survivorship pension is $600, the combined $1,600 already exceeds the $1,375 cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Delaying CPP to age 70 will increase your personal CPP benefit later, while you still receive the full survivorship benefit from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Duration of Survivorship Pension

The CPP survivorship pension is received for life, as long as the survivor is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

*   **Remarriage**: Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility; the pension will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Death of the Survivor**: Payments will stop upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## How to Apply

Applying for the survivorship pension is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Complete the application on the Government of Canada's website and provide documents such as the deceased spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Remember the pro tip to apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on payments due to the 12-month retroactive window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Related Benefits

### CPP Children's Benefit

Children of the deceased may be eligible for the CPP Children's Benefit, which provides financial support after the loss of a contributing parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit is available to both biological and adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

*   **Amount**: In 2024, the CPP child benefit offers a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is not based on the earnings of the survivor or deceased spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Eligibility**: The child must be under 18 years old, or between 18 and 25 and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **How to Apply**: The application is similar to the CPP survivorship benefit, available through Service Canada, and requires supporting documents like proof of school enrollment for children aged 18-25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | CPP Death Benefit]]

The CPP death benefit is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In some cases, it can be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This amount helps cover immediate expenses, such as a portion of funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits

All CPP benefits, including the survivorship pension, child benefit, and [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | death benefit]], are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. They must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Understanding these benefits and their tax implications can be challenging, especially during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

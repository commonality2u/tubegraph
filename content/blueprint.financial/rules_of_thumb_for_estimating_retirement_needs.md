Rules of thumb for [[financial_planning_for_retirement | retirement planning]] are common, straightforward methods that serve as a beneficial starting point for anyone aiming to estimate their retirement savings needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:20">[03:55:20]</a>.

## Common Rules of Thumb

### Age-Based Savings Target
This strategy suggests a target amount of savings relative to your current annual salary at different ages leading up to retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:30">[04:00:30]</a>:
*   By age 30: Aim to have one year of your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:45">[04:02:45]</a>.
*   By age 40: Aim to have three times your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:44">[04:08:44]</a>.
*   By age 50: Aim to have six times your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:42">[04:11:42]</a>.
*   By retirement age: Aim to have between 8 to 10 times your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:28">[04:13:28]</a>.

For example, if you earn $60,000 per year, you should aim to have $60,000 saved by age 30, $180,000 by age 40, and $480,000 by age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:29">[04:17:29]</a>.

### The 4% Rule
This rule suggests that you can safely withdraw 4% of your total retirement savings each year without depleting your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:05">[04:29:05]</a>. This provides a buffer, especially if investments do not perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

For example, if you have $1 million saved, you could withdraw $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:04">[04:37:04]</a>.

### Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income
A common rule of thumb is to plan for an annual retirement income that is 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:36">[04:58:36]</a>. A more conservative approach suggests aiming for 80% to 90% to account for unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:18">[05:04:18]</a>.

For instance, if your pre-retirement income is $100,000 per year, you would plan for an annual retirement income of $80,000 to $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:48">[05:11:48]</a>.

### Household Expenditure Statistics
Real-world data can provide insights into typical spending patterns. According to Stats Canada in 2021, the average annual expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was about $61,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:15">[05:22:15]</a>. In contrast, households aged 40 to 54 spent significantly more, averaging $120,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:46">[05:40:46]</a>. This suggests that expenses typically decrease significantly by the time you reach retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:06">[05:53:06]</a>.

*   Couples typically spend between $5,000 to $9,000 per month, depending on their desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:40">[06:06:40]</a>.

## Pros and Cons of Using Rules of Thumb

### Pros
*   **Simplicity**: These rules are straightforward and easy to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Quick Estimates**: They provide immediate, rough guidelines for how much you might need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Starting Point**: They offer a basic framework to begin [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

### Cons

*   **Risk of Running Out of Money**: Sole reliance on these rules can lead to insufficient funds if expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Example of a Failed Retirement
> Vincent retired at age 60 with $400,000 in savings, planning to withdraw $40,000 annually (a 10% withdrawal rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This rate was much higher than the recommended 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. After five years, unexpected home repairs and minor investment losses, instead of gains, reduced his savings significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. By year 10, his savings were depleted to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. With annual expenses of $40,000 and government pensions (CPP and OAS) only covering $25,000, he faced a $15,000 annual shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This highlights the "risk of ruin"â€”running out of money before the end of one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

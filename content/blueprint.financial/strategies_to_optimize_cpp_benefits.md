Many Canadians receive less than the maximum potential Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average Canadian receiving 40% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding the factors that determine your CPP benefits and applying specific [[strategies to maximize CPP payout | strategies]] can help you get closer to the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Average vs. Maximum CPP Payouts (2024)

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payout amounts vary significantly based on the age you begin receiving your pension and your contribution history.

| Age to Start Pension | Maximum Monthly Amount (2024) | Average Monthly Amount (April 2024) |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------- |
| 65 (Standard Age)    | $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>     | $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>         |
| 60                   | $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>           | $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>              |
| 70                   | $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>          | $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>             |

The average amount paid for a new retirement pension at age 65 in April 2024 was 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | Factors Affecting CPP Payouts]]

The primary [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | factors determining your CPP payouts]] are:

*   **Contributions**: Your CPP retirement pension benefits depend heavily on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the yearly maximum pensionable earnings (YMPE), which was $68,500 for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Average Earnings**: Your average earnings over your career directly relate to your contributions and affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Consistently high annual earnings (at or above the YMPE) maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and thus your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah

David and Sarah are both 65 and receive CPP, but with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:

*   **Sarah**: Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period and consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. She maxed out her CPP benefits and receives $1,364 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **David**: Had gaps in his employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. David received only the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The more you earn and contribute to CPP, the higher your benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## [[tools_and_strategies_for_optimizing_cpp_benefits | Strategies to Maximize CPP Payments]]

Here are some [[strategies to maximize CPP payout | ways to increase your CPP payments]] from below average to the maximum:

1.  **Work While Receiving CPP**:
    *   If you continue working while receiving CPP (up to age 70), you can still contribute to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   These additional contributions earn you a post-retirement benefit, which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

2.  **Drop-Out Provisions**:
    *   **General Drop-Out**: The CPP allows you to drop out up to 17% (approximately 8 years if you contributed for 47 years from age 18 to 65) of your lowest income years from your calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This helps exclude periods of low or no earnings, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   **Child Rearing Drop-Out**: If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years from your CPP calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Disability Provisions**: If you experienced periods of disability, these can adjust your lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

3.  **Max Out Your Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career**:
    *   Aim for your annual income to meet or exceed the YMPE ($68,500 for 2024), which increases over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions and allowing for additional savings or [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment]] for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Seek Higher-Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career; the more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Longevity**: Ensure you have worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings will lead to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## [[estimating_your_cpp_benefits | Estimating Your CPP Benefits]]

To know if you are on track and to estimate your future CPP benefits:

1.  **Rule of Thumb**:
    *   CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Previously, CPP replaced 25% of average work earnings; with new [[reasons_for_cpp_enhancements_and_benefit_planning | enhancements]], it can now replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If your average annual earnings were $40,000, before enhancement CPP would provide about $10,000 annually. After enhancement, it provides about $13,332 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   This method is a ballpark estimate due to maximum limitations and year-by-year calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

2.  **Using Calculators**:
    *   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator**: Comprehensive and provides a detailed estimate of future CPP payments. It is thorough but can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Ativa's Calculator**: A quicker and easier-to-use option, though less accurate the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

3.  **Your Statement of Contributions**:
    *   This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Online**: Access it via your My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Sign in (e.g., through your bank), then navigate to CPP/OAS and the contribution section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   **Phone**: Call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Distinction: [[delaying_cpp_benefits | Delaying CPP Benefits]]

While [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying your CPP start age]] significantly increases your payout, it does not inherently boost you from the average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. The other factors mentioned above (contributions and earnings history) are what enable you to reach the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate strategic consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

It's a common misconception that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. For most individuals, it is generally better to [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delay CPP]] as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

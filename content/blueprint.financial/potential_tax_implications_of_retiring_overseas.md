Many Canadians are choosing to [[retiring_abroad_to_stretch_retirement_savings | retire abroad]] to escape high costs and taxes, and to mitigate the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. When considering international retirement, understanding the tax implications of your move is crucial for [[financial_planning_for_international_retirement | financial planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Eligibility for Expatriates

A significant concern for Canadians retiring abroad is the potential loss of Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The rules for [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_implications_for_expatriates | OAS eligibility and tax implications for expatriates]] differ based on where you apply and how long you've resided in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Canadian Residency Requirement**: If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you only need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, if you are living outside of Canada, you need 20 years of Canadian residency to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Temporary Payments**: If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for six months after leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Social Security Agreements**: This six-month limit does not apply if you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

> [!example] Case Study: David and OAS in Thailand
> David, aged 67, had 15 years of Canadian residency and started collecting OAS in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. When he retired to Thailand, his OAS payments stopped six months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This occurred because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and David did not meet the 20-year residency mark required for long-term payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

It is critical to understand these rules before moving to avoid losing income you have earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Tax Systems in Popular Retirement Destinations

Different countries have varying tax systems that can significantly impact your retirement income.

### Paraguay's Territorial Tax System

Paraguay is gaining interest among Canadian expatriates due to its tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income, such as [[tax_implications_of_cpp | CPP]], OAS, RIFs, or pensions, is not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income in Paraguay is taxed at a flat 10% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This makes Paraguay a potentially highly tax-efficient destination for Canadian retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Other Considerations

While the transcript primarily highlights Paraguay's unique tax advantages, it's generally understood that different countries have different tax treaties and rules that can affect income from sources like CPP, OAS, and [[rrsp_contributions_and_tax_implications_abroad | RRSP contributions and tax implications abroad]] for [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | Canadian expats]]. For instance, in a Canadian context, high tax rates can significantly eat into retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, influencing the decision to move abroad to potentially [[managing_higher_tax_burden_in_retirement | manage a higher tax burden in retirement]].

Since 2019, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) has undergone significant changes, including the recent CPP2 enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While some view these changes as a crucial necessity, others criticize them as a "scam" or "ripoff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These enhancements introduce two levels of contributions with updated thresholds and rates, aiming to improve retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## How the CPP Enhancements Work

The CPP now includes two contribution tiers:
*   **Regular CPP Contributions**: Calculated on earnings up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE), which is $71,400 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Employers match employee contributions, and self-employed individuals pay the combined rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **CPP2 Contributions**: Apply to earnings between the YMPE and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE), which is capped at $81,200 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. No further contributions are paid for earnings above the YAMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

For instance, an individual earning $81,300 in 2025 will contribute both regular CPP and CPP2, reaching a total of approximately $4,440 (matched by their employer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

The ultimate goal of these changes is to increase the income replacement rate from 25% to 33.33% of a worker's average lifetime earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This enhancement is being phased in gradually over 40 years, starting in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For example, someone earning $60,000 annually might see their CPP benefits increase from $15,000 to $20,000 per year once fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. However, individuals retiring sooner will not see as large an increase as those retiring later, reflecting the gradual implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Reasons for CPP Enhancements

The enhancements aim to strengthen the first pillar of Canada's retirement income system, which also includes employer-sponsored pensions and personal savings like [[rsps_and_tfsas | RRSPs and TFSAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This strengthening is a response to shifts in the retirement landscape, particularly the decline of traditional defined benefit pension plans, which have been largely replaced by defined contribution plans that place more investment risk on employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The enhanced CPP is intended to provide a stable, inflation-adjusted foundation of guaranteed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Criticisms of the CPP Enhancement

Despite the government's intentions, the CPP enhancements have faced significant criticism, primarily concerning the added costs and broader economic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Financial Strain on Workers and Employers
Many individuals complain about the increased contribution rates, which previously rose from 4.95% to 5.95%, and now include CPP2 for additional payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Workers**: Face less take-home pay at a time when living costs and inflation are already high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Employers**: Must match increased contributions, which can be a substantial burden for smaller businesses, potentially leading to difficult decisions regarding hiring or other expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This could also lead to employers paying their employees less to offset the increased costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed Individuals**: Are responsible for both the employee and employer portions of contributions, making cash flow management more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Real-world impact
> Many clients, especially employers, have expressed concerns about the impact of these enhancements and the added costs for their teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Broader Economic Concerns
There are worries that these changes could negatively affect the wider economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced Spending**: If employees have less disposable income due to higher contributions, they are likely to spend less, which could slow down economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Business Investment**: Higher payroll costs for businesses might lead them to delay or reduce plans for growth or investment in new opportunities, potentially impacting job creation and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Debates About Mandatory Contributions
A significant point of contention is whether mandatory contributions are the optimal approach to retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Many argue that personal savings options, such as [[rsps_and_tfsas | RRSPs and TFSAs]], offer greater flexibility and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. These allow individuals to decide how much to save and where to invest based on their specific goals and circumstances, unlike the mandatory nature of CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Speaker's Personal View
> The speaker acknowledges both sides of the argument, understanding the need to protect vulnerable Canadians but finding the recent enhancements and increases to be substantial, especially as a business owner who prefers control over investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The speaker personally wishes there was an option to partially opt out of CPP, perhaps for those who meet certain asset or net worth criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, overall, the speaker is generally supportive of the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | CPP enhancements]] due to the belief that [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | CPP Investments]] are well-managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

Money decisions, especially for broad-reaching programs like the CPP, inevitably spark debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The key for individuals is to focus on controllable aspects of their financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

The majority of Canadians receive less than the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average recipient getting 40% less than the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article explores the [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefits|key factors determining your CPP payouts]] and strategies to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts|maximize your CPP payouts]].

## Understanding Average and Maximum Payouts

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, even at the same age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payout amounts vary significantly based on the age you begin receiving your pension:

| Start Age | Average Monthly Amount (2024) | Maximum Monthly Amount (2024) |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------ |
| 60        | $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>              | $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>              |
| 65        | $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>             | $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>            |
| 70        | $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>             | $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>            |

At the standard age of 65, the average amount paid for a new retirement pension in April 2024 was $816.52, which is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Key Factors Determining CPP Payouts

Your CPP retirement pension benefits are heavily influenced by the following [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefits|key factors determining your CPP payouts]]:

### Contributions
Your [[impact_of_salary_on_cpp_contributions|contributions]] to the CPP throughout your working life play a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
To receive the maximum benefit, you typically need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Average Earnings
Your [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|average earnings]] over your career also directly affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Consistently high annual earnings that meet or exceed the YMPE will maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
However, [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|gaps in earnings]] or years with lower earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah
David and Sarah, both 65, receive different CPP payouts due to their [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|contribution history]] and [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|earnings history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:

*   **Sarah:**
    *   Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|contribution period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   Made [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|consistent contributions]], maximizing her CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   Result: Received the maximum payout of $1,364 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

*   **David:**
    *   Had [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|gaps in his employment]] and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings|contribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Had inconsistent contributions due to career changes and lower-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   Result: Received only the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

Essentially, the more you earn and contribute to CPP, the higher your eventual benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Strategies to Increase CPP Payouts

Here are some [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_benefits|strategies to increase CPP benefits]] and potentially move from average to maximum payouts:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working while receiving CPP up to age 70, you can still contribute to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These additional contributions will earn you a post-retirement benefit, which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### 2. Drop Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings from your calculation, which can result in a higher average earnings calculation:

*   **General Dropout Provision:** You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals around 8 years if you've contributed for 47 years (age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Dropout:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions:** Periods of disability can also adjust your lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### 3. Max Out Your Earnings and Contributions
Strive to ensure your annual income meets or exceeds the YMPE, which was $68,500 in 2024 and increases annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
Suggestions to achieve this include:

*   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher paying positions throughout your career, as more earnings mean more CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Contributions:** Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings will lead to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Methods to Estimate CPP Benefits

To see if you're on track for your target CPP benefits, you can use these [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits|methods to estimate CPP benefits]]:

### 1. Rule of Thumb
The CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts. Previously, it replaced 25% of average work earnings; now, it can replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. For example, if your average annual earnings were $40,000, CPP could now replace about one-third, providing roughly $13,332 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This method is a ballpark way to gauge your number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### 2. Online Calculators
For a more tailored estimate, consider using online calculators:

*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** Comprehensive and provides a detailed estimate of future CPP payments. It can take about 30 minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier option, though less accurate the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Statement of Contributions
This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. You can obtain it in two ways:

*   **Online via My Service Canada Account:** Sign in or register, then navigate to the CPP/OAS section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **By Phone:** Call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Distinctions Regarding CPP Timing

While [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision|delaying your CPP start age to increase your payout]] does significantly increase your payout, it does not, by itself, boost you from an average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The other factors mentioned earlier (contributions, earnings) are what primarily determine reaching the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

There is a misconception that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Generally, it's [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision|better to delay your CPP]] as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

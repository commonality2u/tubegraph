In 2019, the website WealthAwesome.com was launched with initial financial goals of earning $3,000 per month and attracting 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These goals were significantly surpassed, with income exceeding the target by almost tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article details the journey of WealthAwesome.com, from its inception and growth to its eventual sale.

## Inspiration and Genesis of WealthAwesome.com

The primary motivation behind starting WealthAwesome.com was the aspiration to live a [[digital_nomad_lifestyle_through_blogging | digital nomad lifestyle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This lifestyle involves having an online source of income that provides the freedom to travel and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Having previously backpacked around Asia, the founder sought to recreate the adventure and freedom of that experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Beyond personal freedom, there was a strong desire to create something that offered a net positive impact on the world, specifically by educating Canadians on financial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This pursuit aimed to provide a sense of purpose and joy through helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The journey began with writing for Canadian media and investment publications on finance topics, leading to a following of tens of thousands of readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Prompted by a friend to start a personal finance education site, the founder recognized an opportunity in the market to produce high-quality content and share their [[digital_nomad_lifestyle_through_blogging | digital nomad journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. With confidence in their financial education and industry experience, WealthAwesome.com was launched in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## [[income_streams_from_blogging_and_affiliate_marketing | Monetization and Financial Success]]

Generating income from the blog was not an immediate process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The first dollar, a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade, was earned in November 2020, approximately a year after launch, following the publication of over 150 articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This initial earning, though small for the hundreds of hours invested, validated the business idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Income rapidly escalated thereafter:
*   The initial goal of $3,000 per month was achieved in February 2021, about 1.5 years after starting the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Peak monthly earnings reached over $20,000, nearing $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   In total, the website generated over $500,000, excluding the undisclosed sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Income was primarily derived from two main sources:
1.  **Advertising**: After reaching 50,000 visitors per month, the site applied for premium ad networks like Mediavine (now requiring 10,000 visitors per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille or 1,000 visitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For finance content, RPMs were exceptionally high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This meant 10,000 visitors could generate around $500 USD (or $700 CAD) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
2.  **[[income_streams_from_blogging_and_affiliate_marketing | Affiliate Commissions]]**: Money was earned by recommending and referring products and services the founder personally believed in and used, such as Well Simple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For instance, an article reviewing trading platforms with embedded affiliate links could earn a commission of $50 to $100 (sometimes up to $150-$200) if a user signed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Traffic Growth and Reach

Website traffic started slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. It took approximately 11 months and 100 articles for the site to gain traction, reaching about 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

*   By January 2021, traffic increased tenfold to 50,000 visitors monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   The site peaked in 2022 at around 250,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   Over its lifespan, WealthAwesome.com accumulated approximately 5 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   A linked YouTube channel also grew to nearly 14,000 subscribers and 1 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## [[lessons_and_challenges_from_starting_and_selling_a_website | Lessons Learned and Personal Growth]]

The experience of building and running WealthAwesome.com provided extensive learning opportunities:

*   **Technical Skills**: Acquired knowledge in website design, search engine optimization (SEO), content writing, and graphic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Business Skills**: Developed abilities in analyzing website data, building affiliate partnerships, website monetization, hiring, managing personnel, and utilizing various online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience**: Previous roles as an analyst (for SEO and outreach data), in business-to-business sales (for website promotion), and as a financial advisor (for content creation and audience connection) were all instrumental in the site's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Personal Development**: Running the business fostered significant personal growth. The founder learned to manage the inherent ups and downs of a business, developing mental toughness to ride out bad results and persist with work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It was realized that while not everything can be controlled, one can control their reaction to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck**: The timing of the site's launch just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending more time online and seeking personal finance education, was acknowledged as a fortunate circumstance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling and Transition

The decision to sell WealthAwesome.com stemmed from several factors:

*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the founder began to lose passion for the daily work, finding it increasingly difficult to motivate themselves to produce content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This highlighted a lesson about moving on when the "fire" starts to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Market Uncertainty**: Concerns about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates caused stress and prompted a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Opportunity**: The site was sold unexpectedly to a close friend and former colleague who was building a portfolio of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. This ensured the site went to someone trusted, who could bring fresh ideas and manage its new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## [[postblogging_ventures_in_financial_planning | New Ventures and Future Focus]]

Following the sale of WealthAwesome.com, the founder embarked on a new business venture: a [[postblogging_ventures_in_financial_planning | financial planning company]] called Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This new endeavor aligns with the founder's values and skills, focusing on building customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

The passion for financial planning stems from the belief that many people have not optimized their finances, and that significant value can be added to Canadians' financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The effectiveness of these plans was first tested personally and then with family members, demonstrating immense value in providing peace of mind and potential financial gains for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This work echoes the personal satisfaction found in one-on-one connections as a financial advisor in a previous corporate role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

The founder continues to focus on creating free financial content on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

This experience led to meeting many interesting people and making a significant impact on financial education for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

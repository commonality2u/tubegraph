Regional differences in how Canadians manage their [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs)]] are evident across the country. A 2023 survey provides insights into these provincial distinctions, highlighting variations in average account balances and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Key Regional Findings (2023)

*   **Ontario** led all provinces with the highest average RRSP balance, reaching $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Canada** recorded the highest average contribution at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   The speaker notes that while one might expect this due to higher incomes and a lower cost of living, this wasn't necessarily the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Despite these regional variations, Canadians across the country remain engaged with their RRSPs, either by accumulating larger account balances or consistently making contributions year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

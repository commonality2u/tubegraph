When considering [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retiring abroad]], understanding how your [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | Canadian retirement income]] will be affected is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For many, the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a cornerstone of their financial future. The good news is that your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] benefits are generally portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## CPP Portability for Non-Residents
Unlike some other benefits, [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] is based on your contributions made during your working life in Canada, not on your residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means that if you become a [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | non-resident]], your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] benefits will continue to be paid to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. The amount you receive remains the same whether you live in Canada or abroad in countries like Portugal, Thailand, or Costa Rica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, Linda, who paid into [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] for 35 years in Toronto, will receive the same payments even after [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retiring]] to Spain, as her benefits are based on contributions, not residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Tax Considerations
While your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] travels with you, there are important [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax considerations]] for [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | non-residents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] payments may be subject to [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | withholding tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Role of Tax Treaties
*   If Canada has a [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]] with your new country of residence, the [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | withholding tax]] could be reduced or even eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   Without a [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]], you could face a 25% [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | withholding tax]] on your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   For instance, if you move to the US, a [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]] allows you to avoid [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | withholding tax]] entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   It's important to review your destination's [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]] with Canada carefully, as agreements vary widely and can significantly impact your net [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements
Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These agreements help:
*   Avoid double contributions to social security systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Ensure uninterrupted [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Coordinate benefits if you've worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Other CPP Benefits
If you are receiving [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] survivor benefits or child benefits, these also continue while you are living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Receiving Payments Abroad
You have several options for receiving your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] payments while abroad:
*   Direct deposit into a Canadian bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   In many countries, you can receive payments in local currency through a local bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Payments can also be mailed as a check in Canadian dollars if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Local Tax Laws
While your [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] amount won't change, your new country of residence might tax these payments differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. It's advisable to check local tax laws to avoid being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Case Study: Anita's Move to Portugal
Anita, a 67-year-old retiree with 22 years of living and working in Canada, chose to move to Portugal, a country with both a social security and [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]] with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Her [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] continued without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Thanks to the [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]], she pays a reduced 15% [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | withholding tax]] on her [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Anita's decision to choose a [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | treaty]] country helped reduce her tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Planning Strategies
*   Consider drawing down your [[retirement_tax_credits_for_canadians | RRSPs]] before becoming a [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | non-resident]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Plan for private health care, as provincial coverage typically ends after 6 to 7 months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

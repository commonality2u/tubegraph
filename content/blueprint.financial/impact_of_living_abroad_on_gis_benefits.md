The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit designed to support low-income seniors residing in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Unlike other Canadian benefits, GIS is not portable when moving abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Automatic Termination of GIS

If a recipient leaves Canada for more than six consecutive months, their GIS payments will cease completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies regardless of whether the individual's income remains low or if they continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

> "According to the government of Canada, your guaranteed income supplement payments can stop if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>

### Case Study: Gan's Experience

Gan, a 71-year-old retiree who received both CPP and GIS in Vancouver, moved to Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A few months into her move, her GIS was terminated because she had been outside Canada for over six months, which automatically disqualified her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Lack of International Protection

There are no social security agreements that protect GIS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. GIS is strictly tied to a recipient's physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, meaning it will not follow you abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. There is no workaround or treaty to maintain GIS while living overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Planning Implications for Retirees

If [[gis_income_thresholds_and_benefit_updates_in_2025 | GIS]] is a critical component of your retirement income, it is essential to consider this factor before [[factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | relocating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. You may need to:
*   Delay your move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Adjust your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Explore other income options to replace the loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

### Residency Trick (Snowbird Strategy)

Some retirees maintain part-year residency in Canada to retain their healthcare and tax status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This "snowbird" approach involves spending winters in warmer climates like Florida or Mexico, but ensuring they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This strategy allows them to continue receiving benefits tied to Canadian residency.

## Summary: GIS as a Travel Companion

Think of GIS as a friend who "just loves Canada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. While generous when you're in Canada, once you leave for more than six months, GIS will cease payments without any treaty, workaround, or notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Cheat Sheet for Benefits Abroad

The following table summarizes how GIS behaves when a recipient leaves Canada:

| Benefit | Status When Leaving Canada | Key Condition / Notes |
| :------ | :------------------------- | :-------------------- |
| **GIS** | Stops after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> | Requires ongoing Canadian residency; no treaty or workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a> |

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] does not always end upon death; a portion can be transferred to a surviving spouse or family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines what a spouse or family could receive and how to claim the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP Survivorship Pension Eligibility]]

To qualify for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]], two main requirements must be met:
*   **Relationship Status** You must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **[[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] Contributions** The deceased must have contributed to [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for at least 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Important Application Tip

It is crucial to apply for the survivorship pension as soon as possible after your partner's death, as retroactive payments are limited to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Delaying could result in lost payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For example, if Emma is eligible for $700 per month and waits 18 months to apply, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Calculating the CPP Survivorship Pension Amount

The amount of [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] survivorship pension received depends on two key factors:
1.  The survivor's age at the time of the spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
2.  The amount the deceased spouse contributed to the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Scenarios Based on Survivor's Age

Let's use an example where John passed away at age 65 and would have received $1,200 a month in [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

#### Survivor Under 65 Years Old

If Emma is under 65 when John passes away, she receives a flat rate amount plus 37.5% of John's calculated [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   For 2024, the flat rate is $227 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Emma's pension would be $450 (37.5% of $1,200) plus $227, totaling $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

#### Survivor 65 Years or Older

Once Emma turns 65, her survivorship pension is recalculated, and she will receive up to 60% of John's calculated pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   If John's [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension was calculated at $1,200 per month, Emma's survivorship pension would be $720 a month (60% of $1,200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Pension Calculation Regardless of Deceased's Age

The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of whether they passed away younger or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This means the benefit is based on what the deceased would have received at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   If John passed away at 60, 65, or 70, the same calculation applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Emma would still receive $677 if under 65, or $720 if 65 or older, based on John's calculated pension at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Real-Life Average and Maximum Payments ([[estimating_cpp_benefits | Estimating CPP Benefits]])

Based on actual data:
*   **Under 65:** The average payment is $524 a month, with a maximum of $739 a month. This includes both the flat rate and 37.5% of the deceased spouse's pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **65 or Older:** The average payment is $323 per month, with a maximum of $818 a month. Survivors over 65 receive 60% of their spouse's pension without the flat rate portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

The gap between average and maximum payments suggests many survivors do not receive the full pension, likely due to the spouse's contribution history or their own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits affecting the payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Maximum payouts are only achieved if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Maximum Survivor Pension Cap

There is a cap on the total [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits you can receive if you are also collecting your own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount cannot exceed the maximum [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Examples of Combined Benefits

*   **Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension:** If Emma receives $800/month from her own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension and qualifies for $700/month from John's survivorship pension, her combined total would be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. However, due to the retirement cap of $1,375, her benefits would be reduced to that cap amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Lower Retirement Pension:** If Emma's [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension is $400/month and she qualifies for $600/month from John's survivorship pension, her combined total is $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Since this is below the cap, she would receive the full $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Disability Pension Combined with Survivorship Pension:** If Emma receives $1,200/month from [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] disability benefits and qualifies for $500/month from John's survivorship pension, her combined total would be $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Due to the combined survivor and disability pension cap at $1,613 per month, her total benefits would be adjusted to that cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Advanced Planning Strategies for the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] Cap

*   **Start [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] Early if Below the Cap:** If your own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] early might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This allows you to collect both your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For example, if your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] is $400/month and survivorship is $500/month, the combined $900 is well below the $1,375 retirement cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Delay [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] if Near the Cap:** If your expected [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] is close to the maximum, delaying your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] can maximize your overall benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This way, you receive a higher survivorship pension without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For example, if your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] at 65 is $1,000/month and survivorship pension is $600, the combined $1,600 already exceeds the $1,375 cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] to age 70 will increase your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefit later, while you continue to receive the full survivorship benefit from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Duration of Survivorship Pension

The [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]] is received for life, with no time limits, as long as the survivor is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Remarrying:** Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility; the pension will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Death of Survivor:** Payments will stop upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## [[how_to_apply_for_cpp_survivor_benefits | How to Apply for the Survivorship Pension]]

Applying is straightforward:
*   Complete the application on the Government of Canada's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Provide documents such as your spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   Remember to apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on payments, as there is only a 12-month retroactive window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Children's Benefits

If the deceased contributed to [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]], their children may be eligible for the [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_ccb_benefits | CPP children's benefit]], which provides financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit is available to both biological and adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Amount and Eligibility

*   **Amount:** In 2024, the [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_ccb_benefits | CPP child benefit]] offers a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is not based on earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Eligibility:** The child must be under 18 years old, or between 18 and 25 and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### How to Apply

The application process is similar to the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship benefit]] and can be done through Service Canada, requiring supporting documents such as proof of school enrollment for children aged 18-25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## [[cpp_death_benefit_and_tax_implications | CPP Death Benefit]]

The [[cpp_death_benefit_and_tax_implications | CPP death benefit]] is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In some cases, it may be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This amount helps cover immediate expenses like a portion of funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## [[cpp_death_benefit_and_tax_implications | Tax Implications of CPP Benefits]]

All [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits mentioned (survivorship pension, child benefit, and death benefit) are taxable and must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

The [[canadian_housing_market|Canadian housing market]] presents significant challenges for many first-time home buyers, with prices reaching "skyhigh" levels, especially in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This environment can make home ownership feel "further Out Of Reach than ever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Skyrocketing Prices Across Regions
In cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, home prices have soared, making it difficult to save enough for a substantial down payment or even afford mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Even in traditionally more affordable areas, a rapid rise in prices is forcing buyers to secure larger down payments to remain competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

For instance, a $200,000 down payment, achievable through combined savings strategies, represents about 32% of the total cost in more affordable cities like Montreal and Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, in higher-priced markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, that same $200,000 only covers approximately 16% to 19% of the cost, necessitating much larger mortgages for buyers in those cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## The Importance of Tax-Advantaged Savings
Saving a significant down payment, such as $200,000, without the aid of tax benefits can be extremely challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. For example, an individual facing a 30% tax rate would need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 remaining after taxes, meaning an additional $85,000 must be saved to reach the down payment goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Strategies to Mitigate Challenges
Despite these difficulties, strategies exist to help first-time home buyers achieve their goals sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combining tools like the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) via the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) can significantly boost savings for a down payment, making home ownership more achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### First Home Savings Account (FHSA)
The FHSA is a "fantastic new tool for first-time home buyers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Contribution Limits**: Allows contributions of up to $8,000 annually, with a lifetime maximum of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Tax Benefits**: Contributions are tax-deductible, similar to an RSP, offering a tax break each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Qualifying withdrawals for a home purchase are entirely tax-free, meaning every saved dollar goes directly towards the home without repayment obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Spousal Advantage**: Couples can double their FHSA savings to $80,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Growth Potential**: Contributing the maximum $8,000 annually for 5 years would reach $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. With a 6% annual return, this could grow to approximately $45,000 in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. If left for another 10 years at the same rate, it could reach around $80,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, essentially doubling the original contribution completely tax-free when used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
The RSP is a common tool for [[challenges_of_retirement_income_in_canada | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, but it also offers the HBP to assist first-time buyers.
*   **Contribution Limits**: Allows contributions up to 18% of income annually, or a maximum of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawal**: Individuals can withdraw up to $60,000 tax-free from their RSP for a first home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Spousal Advantage**: For couples, this withdrawal limit doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Repayment Obligation**: Unlike the FHSA, the HBP requires repayment over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Missing a repayment results in the amount being added to taxable income for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Combined Impact on Down Payments
By strategically combining both the FHSA and HBP, first-time buyers can accumulate substantial down payments. For example, a couple maximizing both accounts could save $80,000 from their FHSAs and withdraw $120,000 from their RSPs via the HBP, totaling $200,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

With growth, combined FHSA balances for a couple could exceed $160,000 over 15 years, and when paired with HBP withdrawals of $120,000, this could provide a total of $280,000 for a tax-free down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This provides a "huge leg up in the housing market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Individual Savings Potential
> Even without a partner, an individual can utilize these strategies to save up to $100,000 for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Using these tax-advantaged accounts drastically cuts down the total amount an individual needs to save, as every dollar contributed goes directly towards the home purchase without income taxes on that portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This strategic planning can transform what seems impossible into a "real opportunity to actually finally own a home in Canada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

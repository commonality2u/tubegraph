These [[tips_to_legally_reduce_tax_liabilities | strategies]] help protect and grow net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:00">[14:11:00]</a>.

## Claiming Business Expenses

Operating a business involves various costs, many of which are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This effectively reduces your taxable income, putting more money back into your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

Common deductible expenses include:
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>
*   Marketing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>
*   Business travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>
*   Professional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>
*   A portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>

> **Example:** If you earn $80,000 annually but claim $20,000 in business expenses, your taxable income decreases to $60,000. At a 30% tax rate, this results in $6,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

> A dollar of self-employed income is often considered more valuable than a dollar of employee income due to the significant tax write-off opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

## Home Office Deductions

If you work from home, you may be eligible to deduct a percentage of your household expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. This includes costs such as rent, utilities, and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>. The deductible percentage is based on the proportion of your home used for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

> **Example:** If your home office occupies 10% of your home and your total annual household expenses are $30,000, you can claim a $3,000 deduction, saving $900 if your tax rate is 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

## Hire a Family Member

You can pay a reasonable salary to a spouse or family member who assists with your business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. This strategy shifts income to a family member in a lower tax bracket, leading to overall family tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

> **Example:** If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 (taxed at 20%), your taxable income drops to $70,000. This saves you $10,500 in taxes, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes on their income. The net family tax savings totals $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.
>
> **Important Note:** The salary paid must be reasonable for the services provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. The CRA is strict on this rule, so paying an unreasonably high salary for minimal tasks (e.g., $100,000 for basic data entry) is not permissible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

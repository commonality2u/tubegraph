When planning to leave Canada permanently, it is crucial to understand how your Old Age Security (OAS) benefits will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This guide breaks down the eligibility, benefit changes, and [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | tax considerations]] for OAS when becoming a nonresident.

## OAS Basics

OAS is based on the time you spent living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It can be collected as early as age 65, with the option to defer it up to age 70 for increased benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Eligibility for Receiving OAS Abroad

To receive OAS benefits while living abroad, you generally must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

If you haven't met this 20-year threshold, you might still qualify if you:
*   Worked abroad for a Canadian company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Lived in a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Note that years spent in these countries do not count towards the OAS benefit amount itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Impact on Benefit Amount

The OAS benefit amount remains the same regardless of where you live, provided you meet the eligibility requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | impact of Canadian residency on OAS benefits]].

### Additional OAS Benefits

Additional OAS benefits, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Survivor Allowance, require you to reside in Canada to receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Moving abroad will disqualify you from receiving these allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | Tax Implications]] for Nonresidents

### OAS Clawback (Recovery Tax)

High-income earners may face the OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax, which applies to earnings over a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This clawback still applies to nonresidents, unless you move to a country with a tax treaty with Canada that potentially allows you to bypass it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Nonresidents typically must file a T136 form annually to determine any required repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Withholding Tax

Countries without a tax treaty with Canada may impose a withholding tax on OAS payments, typically around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. For example, if you move to the U.S., there will be no withholding tax on your OAS due to the tax treaty between Canada and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Always check the specific tax treaty details for your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

### Filing Requirements

To collect OAS abroad, you must file an annual tax return reporting your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Pro Tip for OAS Income Management

If you are at risk of the OAS clawback, consider managing your income through strategic withdrawals from other retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Additionally, you might consider deferring OAS payments up to age 72 to increase your monthly benefit by 0.6% for each month deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Consulting a Professional

It is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional to fully understand the specific details and implications for your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Ideally, seek advice from professionals in both Canada and your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

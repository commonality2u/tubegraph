The annual tax deadline in Canada is April 30th, and failing to claim eligible tax credits can mean missing out on significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canada offers numerous tax credits, making it easy to overlook opportunities for substantial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide covers key tax credits, from the most common to [[overlooked_canadian_tax_breaks | hidden gems]], and strategies for stacking multiple credits for greater benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Note that the first credit listed, the Basic Personal Amount, is automatically applied, but most others require manual claiming on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Key Canadian Tax Credits

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)
The BPA is a non-refundable tax credit allowing Canadians to earn a portion of their income tax-free before federal income tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the BPA is $15,129 for individuals with net incomes below the 29% tax bracket threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the Age Amount Tax Credit, a non-refundable credit aimed at reducing taxes in [[retirement tax credits in Canada | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

However, if net income exceeds approximately $44,000, the credit gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This tax break helps [[tax_saving_tips_for_canadian_retirees | retirees]] retain more of their money and manage taxable income efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)
The CCA offers tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim $8,081 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. An additional $2,861 may be available for a child under 18 with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on the dependent's net income, and eligibility varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. It is important to retain medical documentation if required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Medical Expenses Tax Credit
This credit helps Canadians offset out-of-pocket healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Eligible expenses include prescriptions, dental care, vision care, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and medical travel expenses if care is unavailable locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. To maximize your claim, combine expenses for yourself, your spouse, and dependents, and keep detailed records and receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Stacking Multiple Credits for Bigger Refunds

Maximizing tax savings isn't just about knowing individual credits but strategically combining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many Canadians are unaware of how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Savings Combo
This strategy is often used for clients seeking [[tax_saving_tips_for_canadian_retirees | retirement tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Amount**: Up to $2,000 per person on eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Credit**: Provides an extra tax break for those aged 65 and over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> John and Linda are both retired and over 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. They can each claim the pension income amount to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Additionally, John qualifies for the Age Amount Credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
>
> **Stacked Savings**: Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
> **Bonus Tip**: Pension income splitting can save even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**: Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> Sarah and Mike have two young children; their children attend daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
>
> *   **Canada Child Benefit**: They receive tax-free monthly payments to help with child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
> *   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
> *   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: Since one child has a disability, they receive an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
>
> **Stacked Savings**: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
> **Bonus Tip**: Families can also split income by contributing to a spouse's Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

[[Income splitting with RRSPs | Income splitting]] is a strategy designed to reduce a household's overall tax burden by transferring income from a higher-earning spouse to a lower-earning spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This is effective because income is taxed at a lower rate for the spouse in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
To utilize this strategy, individuals must first convert their RRSP into a RRIF once they turn 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This conversion makes the income from the RRIF eligible for [[Income splitting strategies for tax savings | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. It's crucial to note that both spouses must be at least 65 years old for this strategy to apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Up to 50% of the eligible [[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | pension income]], including RRIF withdrawals, can be allocated to the lower-earning spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This allocation is reported on the tax return, which subsequently reduces the combined taxable income for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Example Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
Consider Jane and Bob, both 67 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Jane has a RRIF and an annual income of $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   Bob has no RRIF and earns $20,000 annually from part-time work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

By [[Income Splitting and Tax Savings for Families and Retirees | splitting Jane's RRIF income]], she allocates $10,000 to Bob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This results in:
*   Jane's taxable income: $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>
*   Bob's taxable income: $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

This [[Income Splitting for Tax Savings | income splitting strategy]] significantly lowers their combined taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

To claim [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | pension income splitting]] on a tax return, both spouses must complete Form T1032, "Joint Election to Split Pension Income," and include it with their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This form ensures proper reporting of the income split and allows both parties to benefit from the tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

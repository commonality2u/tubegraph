The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) offers a significant benefit for retirees concerned about the rising [[cost_of_living_adjustments_for_cpp_oas_and_gis_in_2025 | cost of living]], as it is indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>. This means that CPP payouts are designed to increase over time to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>.

## How CPP Adjusts for Inflation
If you are worried about inflation in retirement, the CPP is unique because its payouts are indexed to keep up with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>. This feature ensures that your purchasing power is maintained, even during periods of high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>.

For instance, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>.

## Benefits of Delayed CPP and Inflation Indexing
Delaying your CPP payments can result in larger, inflation-indexed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>. This strategy allows for a higher starting benefit amount, which then continues to grow with inflation over your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>.

The CPP is considered a unique and special pension from the Canadian government, specifically designed to support retirees during times of higher cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37">[04:37]</a>. Unlike many market investments, which may not be indexed to inflation, CPP provides a guaranteed, inflation-adjusted income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>.

Choosing to delay your CPP payments can mean trading uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in your future, inflation-adjusted CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26">[12:26]</a>.

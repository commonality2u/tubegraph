Spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) contributions are a tax-saving strategy for couples in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This method helps spread out retirement income, which can reduce overall household taxes in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Spousal RRSP Contributions

*   **Income Spreading** Instead of an individual maximizing their own RRSP, contributions can be made to a [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This strategy is particularly beneficial if one spouse earns significantly more than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Lower Future Tax Bills** The primary goal is to lower future tax bills by having retirement income withdrawn and taxed under the spouse's potentially lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This effectively achieves a similar outcome to [[pension_income_splitting_in_canada | pension income splitting]] by balancing income in retirement.
*   **Immediate Tax Deduction** The individual making the contribution still receives an immediate tax deduction for the contribution, just as if they contributed to their own RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Private Equity is a high-stakes investment, often described as an exclusive VIP club for those with deep pockets, the right connections, and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. It is one of three powerful [[key_investment_strategies_and_options | strategies]] wealthy Canadians use to grow and protect their money beyond traditional Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## What is Private Equity?

Private Equity involves investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments typically include:
*   Funding startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Financing turnarounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>
*   Supporting business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>

Unlike traditional stocks, private equity comes with higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, it also offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit their capital for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Private Equity and RSPs

RSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments, generally not allowing direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means most private equity investments must be held outside an RSP, unless they are structured through a specialized vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### When Private Equity Can Be Held in an RSP

Despite these restrictions, certain self-directed RSPs provide access to private equity under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts allow investors to hold CRA-approved private equity funds, enabling them to benefit from tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Examples include:
*   The North Leaf Capital Partners Private Equity Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Select private equity investments offered by Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>

While it is possible to invest in private equity through RSPs, many private equity investments will not be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Downsides of Private Equity

Like any high-reward investment, private equity carries notable drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These include:

### High Fees
Private equity investments come with significant costs, such as management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Understanding these expenses is crucial before investing, as they can dramatically diminish profits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Very High Risk
Private equity investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. There is always a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, many Canadian investors suffered losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture under private equity real estate investing, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Long Lockup Periods
Investors must be prepared to commit their funds for extended periods, typically between five to ten years, before seeing any returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For instance, an investment of $100,000 into private equity might yield $300,000 five years later when the company goes public, but during those five years, the funds remain inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Private equity is not for the faint of heart, but for patient and strategic investors, it can be a powerful wealth-building tool beyond an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

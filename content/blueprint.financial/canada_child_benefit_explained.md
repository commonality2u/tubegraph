The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at a staggering $293,000 from birth to age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_canada_child_benefit | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) is a tax-free payment that aims to assist families with children under 18, potentially covering almost half of this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## What is the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)?

The CCB is a tax-free payment provided by the Canadian government to help families with the costs of raising children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It is designed as an umbrella to shield families from rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Key Features
The CCB has two primary features:
*   **Indexed to Inflation:** The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free:** Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions or surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### How Can You Use the Funds?
There are no restrictions on how families can use the CCB funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This means the money can be used for various expenses such as food, housing, education, or other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Maximum Payments and Potential Support

Over 18 years, eligible families can receive up to $125,500 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The maximum annual payments vary by age:
*   **Children under six:** Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Children aged six to 17:** Up to $6,570 per year, totaling $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Combined, this amounts to $125,500 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

There is no limit to the number of children for whom you can receive the CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For example:
*   One child: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Two children: Doubles to $251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Three children: A total of $376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   A family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Impact on Family Costs

The average cost of raising a child to age 17 is estimated at $293,000, or about $17,235 per year for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Families earning over $135,000 annually spend more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In contrast, families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_canada_child_benefit | Eligibility and Calculation of Canada Child Benefit]]

The CCB is based on your [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, AFNI is the combined income of both spouses minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. As your net income increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced or no payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The reduction in benefits happens in two stages:
1.  **Stage 1:** If your AFNI is between $36,525 and $79,000, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
2.  **Stage 2:** If your AFNI is above $79,000 (after the previous reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over the $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Example of CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six
The benefit gradually decreases as income increases:
*   **$35,000 AFNI or less:** Families receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year, or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **$50,000 AFNI:** The annual benefit is reduced to about $6,840, or $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **$100,000 AFNI:** The annual benefit drops significantly to around $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **$130,000 AFNI:** The benefit further reduces to about $1,814 per year, or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

At very high-income levels, the benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. For exact numbers, it is recommended to use the CRA's CCB calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Receiving Payments

### How to Get Paid
Getting the CCB is simple. Once you file your taxes, the CRA automatically calculates your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. No extra application is needed, as long as you and your partner file your taxes every year and your child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Filing your taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the climate action incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

For faster payments, set up direct deposit with the CRA to have the money sent directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Payment Dates
CCB payment dates are typically between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### Updating Information
It is crucial to keep your information up to date with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. If your family's income changes due to events like job loss, marriage, the birth of a new baby, or divorce, updating the CRA immediately can potentially qualify you for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Similarly, changes in shared custody arrangements should be reported, as the CRA typically splits payments 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## [[impact_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | Purpose and Impact of the CCB]]

The CCB is a key tool for the Canadian government in reducing child poverty and supporting families across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Its impact has been significant:
*   In 2021 alone, it helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   It supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

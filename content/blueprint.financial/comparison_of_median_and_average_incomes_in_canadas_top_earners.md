This article breaks down the income levels required to be among Canada's top earners, specifically focusing on the disparities between median and average incomes within the top 10%, 5%, and 1% categories.

## Top 10% Earners

To join the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10% of individual income earners in Canada]], an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Within this group:
*   **Median Income**: $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Average Income**: $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

The threshold to enter the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 10%]] rose by 14.3% between 2018 and 2022, from $97,000 to around $111,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

This significant gap indicates that a small number of ultra-high earners substantially inflate the average, highlighting growing income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Figures like Jim Patterson, with an estimated net worth over $11 billion, contribute to skewing this average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Key Insights into Income Disparity

Across all top earner categories, the consistent and significant gap between median and average incomes highlights a strong concentration of wealth at the very top. This suggests that while entry thresholds for these groups are substantial, a smaller subset of ultra-high earners significantly inflates the average income figures. This trend points to a continued widening of [[household_income_variability_in_canada | income inequality in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Despite economic shocks like the COVID-19 pandemic, top earners continued to experience considerable income growth, remaining relatively insulated from broader economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

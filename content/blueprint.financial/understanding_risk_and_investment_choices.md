Building a significant investment portfolio, such as reaching $100,000 in a TFSA, requires making informed choices about your investments and understanding the associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The journey from $10,000 to $100,000 in a TFSA can be achieved by getting five key things right: selecting the right investments, understanding the impact of time, optimizing your rate of return, making regular contributions, and [[Common Investment Mistakes | avoiding common mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Selecting the Right Investments: The "Ingredients"

Your investment choices form the foundation of your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. It is crucial to choose high-quality investments that align with your [[Risk Management in Mutual Fund Investments | risk tolerance]] and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Popular Investment Options in Canada

*   **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)**: These are like a "one-stop shop" where a single purchase invests you in hundreds or thousands of companies, effectively spreading out risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. ETFs are generally more affordable and cheaper than mutual funds in Canada, meaning fewer returns are lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Examples include Vanguard's VFV (tracking the S&P 500) or portfolio series like XEQT and VGRO, which encompass global stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Dividend Stocks**: These offer the benefit of regular payouts while you invest, which can be reinvested to compound returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Dividend stocks can add stability and income to your [[Portfolio management and risk assessment | portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors**: These services create and manage a personalized investment portfolio for you, handling adjustments automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. They are ideal for new investors or those preferring a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Wealthsimple and Questwealth are examples of such services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Rate of Return and Risk Tolerance: The "Heat"

The rate of return on your investments significantly impacts how quickly your money grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. However, higher returns often come with higher [[Balancing risk and return to optimize investment strategies | risk]].

*   **Low Returns (e.g., 4%)**: Investing $10,000 at a 4% annual return without additional contributions would take 59 years to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This is typical for a balanced ETF portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Moderate Returns (e.g., 7%)**: A 7% return reduces the timeline to 34 years, shaving off 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This can be achieved with a portfolio more heavily weighted towards equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Growth (e.g., 10%)**: Aggressive strategies could cut the timeline to 24 years, saving 35 years compared to 4% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, this comes with much higher volatility and risks, and maintaining a 10% return over two decades is unlikely for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The key is to find your comfort zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Your desired rate of return reflects your [[Developing an investment philosophy | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   For stability, consider a balanced ETF portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   If you can handle more volatility, allocate a portion to higher-growth options like tech or international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[Common Investment Mistakes | Avoiding Common Investment Pitfalls]]

Even with a solid plan, certain missteps can hinder your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Taking on Too Much Risk
Some investors pursue extreme growth through speculative investments like meme stocks or cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While these *can* offer massive returns, they often come with significant risks, and the chances of losing money are much higher than achieving sustained high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Recovering from significant losses can take years and derail your portfolio growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Playing It Too Safe
Conversely, some investors stick to low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or cash, believing it's the safest route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. While these protect your principal, they severely limit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. For instance, at a 2% return, $10,000 would take 116 years to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Low returns barely outpace inflation, diminishing your purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   You miss out on the compounding potential of higher-growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Trying to Time the Market
Many investors attempt to buy low and sell high by predicting market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This strategy is extremely difficult to execute consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Most people miss out on the best-performing market days by staying on the sidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   Even professionals struggle to time the market accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Staying invested through market fluctuations typically outperforms attempts to predict swings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Ignoring Fees
High fees, often associated with mutual funds, can significantly erode your returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. For example, a 2% management fee on a $100,000 portfolio could cost tens of thousands of dollars over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Low-cost options like ETFs offer similar market exposure with significantly lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Not Understanding Your Investments and [[Portfolio management and risk assessment | Risk Tolerance]]
Before committing to any investment, take time to understand how it works and if it aligns with your [[Balancing risk and return to optimize investment strategies | risk tolerance]] and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Many investors overestimate their ability to handle risk, leading to poor decisions when markets become volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Be honest with yourself and build a portfolio that suits your comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

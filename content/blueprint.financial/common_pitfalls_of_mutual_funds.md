Mutual funds are often perceived as a smart and safe investment choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, they can silently diminish wealth due to various hidden issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These issues include convoluted fees, complicated reporting, and confusing jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

Key signs that a mutual fund may be holding back an investor's financial growth include underperformance against benchmarks, high fees, excessive risk, "closet indexing," and tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## 1. Underperformance Relative to Benchmarks

Many investors mistakenly believe they are on track as long as their mutual fund is making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, if a fund earns significantly less than the overall market or its benchmark, it represents a loss of potential wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, a 10% return is less impressive if the benchmark returned 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### How to Check Performance

Every mutual fund should be compared against a relevant benchmark, such as the S&P TSX Composite Index for Canadian equity funds or the S&P 500 for US equity large-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The benchmark is typically listed for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

A simple way to evaluate performance is by searching the fund name plus "Morningstar" online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Morningstar provides detailed historical returns, quartile rankings, and comparisons to its category and benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

#### Example: Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A

This fund, despite managing $4 billion in assets, has consistently underperformed its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   An initial investment of $10,000 grew to $16,458, while the index reached $18,814 and its category grew to $17,079 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   In 2024, it was in the fourth quartile (bottom 25%) of its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   For three-, five-, and ten-year rankings, it remained in the third quartile, indicating consistent underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Over a decade, it trailed the index by 1.41% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. An investor with $100,000 in this fund could have missed out on tens of thousands of dollars in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

A [[avoiding_common_investment_mistakes | common investor mistake]] is focusing only on positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If a fund grows by 3% when the market grew by 10%, an investor effectively loses 7% in missed gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Broader Underperformance Trends

The SPIVA Canada Midyear 2024 report confirms that most actively managed funds in Canada underperform their benchmarks over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. The longer a fund is held, the larger the performance gap becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Two-thirds of Canadian equity funds underperformed their benchmarks in the first half of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Over a 10-year period, a staggering 93.4% of actively managed Canadian equity funds failed to beat their benchmark, meaning only 6% succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## 2. [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | High Fees]] That Eat Away at Returns

Banks earn billions from fees, which many mutual fund investors underestimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Even a well-performing fund can have its long-term growth significantly eroded by excessive fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A 2% annual fee over 30 years could reduce the final investment value by over 50%, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### The Hidden Cost of a 2% Fee Example

An initial investment of $100,000 earning a 7% annual return:
*   **With no fees**: Grows to approximately $761,000 after 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **With a 2% annual fee**: Grows to only $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   This represents a difference of nearly $330,000 lost to fees, meaning 2% in fees wiped out 43% of potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Mutual Fund Fees That Destroy Wealth

*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: For equity funds, anything over 1.6% is considered high, and for bond funds, anything over 0.75% is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. In contrast, most index ETFs charge only 0.05% to 0.25%, making mutual fund MERs potentially 30 times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Hidden Trailer Fees**: Many mutual funds include commissions (often 1%) paid to advisors, which can incentivize them to sell high-fee funds rather than what's best for the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **High Trading Fees / Turnover Ratio**: Funds that frequently buy and sell stocks incur high trading costs, which are often passed on to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Red Flags in Fees

*   **Advisor won't explain fees clearly**: If an advisor dodges questions or makes fee structures confusing, they likely benefit from those fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **High Redemption Fees**: Some mutual funds penalize investors for switching investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Segregated Funds (SEG Funds)**: These are insurance products that resemble mutual funds but have extremely high fees (often 3-4%) and insurance features most investors don't need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   **How to identify**: Held with an insurance company (e.g., Sunlife, Manulife, Canada Life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>; include words like "segregated" or "guaranteed benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>; have fees exceeding 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>; or have a maturity period (e.g., 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## 3. Excessive Risk and Stress

Investments should offer peace of mind, not stress and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If market drops cause lost sleep, constant portfolio checking, or panic, the mutual fund might be too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Signs of Too Much Risk

*   **Stress during market declines**: Worrying, impulsively selling investments, or losing confidence in the financial plan during a market dip indicates a misalignment with risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Emotional reaction to market news**: Too much risk can lead to panic selling, locking in losses and preventing recovery benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of understanding of fund holdings**: Some mutual funds hold volatile assets or use complex, non-transparent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Not knowing the risk level can lead to unpleasant surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Mismatched investment timeline and fund risk**: Holding high-risk equity funds when money is needed in a few years can lead to large short-term losses and derail financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### "Mental Wealth"

Even if a risky investment performs well over time, it's not worth it if it negatively impacts mental clarity and the ability to stay the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### How to Fix Excessive Risk

*   **Recalibrate risk exposure**: A balanced portfolio should align with financial goals, time horizon, and ability to handle volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Take an investor questionnaire**: Free tools (e.g., from Vanguard) can help assess risk tolerance and adjust portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Consider more stable investments**: Switching from an aggressive mutual fund to a diversified ETF portfolio or lower-volatility fund can improve peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## 4. "Closet Indexing"

Closet indexing is a significant problem where a mutual fund pretends to be actively managed but closely tracks an index while charging high fees associated with active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Investors pay for expert decision-making but receive the same returns as a cheap ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Example: TD Canadian Equity Fund

This $7.4 billion fund markets itself as actively managed, but its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. It charges a very high MER of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Underperformance**: Over 10 years, it returned 6.87% annually, while the index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Excessive Fees**: The 2.19% MER significantly erodes returns compared to a low-cost Canadian index ETF like XIC (0.06%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Low Active Share**: A low turnover rate of 12% indicates the fund isn't making bold investment decisions, yet charges high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Over 10 years, an investor with $100,000 in this fund could have missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains while paying steep fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Closet Indexing in Canada

Canada has a poor track record with closet indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds are invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   A Morningstar study found many actively managed Canadian mutual funds have low active share scores, meaning they deviate minimally from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### How to Identify Closet Indexers

Closet indexers will not admit they are expensive index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Compare holdings to a benchmark ETF**: If stock allocations are nearly identical, the investor is paying high fees for no added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This was demonstrated in a video about [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_a_tfsa | TFSA Wealth Killers]], comparing the RBC equity fund to Vanguard's VFV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Look at long-term returns**: If a fund's performance moves in lockstep with an index but charges higher fees, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Check the turnover rate**: A low turnover rate (under 20%) suggests the fund is barely trading, indicating few active decisions despite high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Consider tracking error**: If a fund's returns consistently match the index year-over-year, it is likely a closet indexer in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## 5. [[tax_inefficiency_and_distribution_issues_with_mutual_funds | Tax Inefficiencies]] That Cost Thousands

Even well-performing mutual funds can have their returns silently drained by [[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds_and_alternatives | tax inefficiencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Many investors unknowingly pay more taxes due to avoidable tax consequences triggered by their mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Tax Traps Hidden in Mutual Funds

*   **Distributions that trigger unnecessary taxes**: Many mutual funds distribute capital gains, dividends, and interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. If held in a taxable account, taxes might be owed even if nothing was sold, or even if the fund lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Holding high dividend funds in a taxable account**: Dividend-paying mutual funds can be tax-inefficient outside of a TFSA or RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While Canadian dividends receive a dividend tax credit, US and international dividends are typically taxed at the full marginal rate, leading to unnecessary tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

### How to Reduce Investment Taxes

*   **Use the right accounts**: Keep dividend-heavy or income-generating funds in RRSPs or TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient ETFs or capital growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Consider switching to ETFs**: Many mutual funds frequently distribute capital gains, whereas broad market ETFs can be more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Rebalance wisely**: Selling funds can trigger capital gains tax, so be strategic about when and how changes are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Psychological Traps Keeping Investors Stuck

Even if aware of underperforming, high-fee mutual funds, investors can be held back by psychological traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:
*   **Loyalty**: "I've been with this bank forever, they must be looking out for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Trust in advice**: "My advisor says this fund is great, so it must be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Inertia**: "I don't want to switch, it's just too much hassle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

However, an investor's financial future and family's well-being should always prioritize over loyalty or minor inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Alternatives to Mutual Funds

For those holding high-fee, underperforming mutual funds, there are more transparent and potentially lower-fee investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>:

*   **Switch from Series A to Series F funds**: Series A funds, typically sold by banks, include hidden advisor fees. Series F funds are a lower-cost version without embedded advisor commissions, usually accessible through discount brokerages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. If an advisor isn't providing real financial planning, consider alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)**: ETFs have much lower MERs, starting around 0.05% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. They offer better tax efficiency and often outperform mutual funds due to their low-fee approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Low-fee Mutual Funds**: While rare in Canada, a few actively managed funds exist with reasonable MERs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **DIY Stock Investing**: For those willing to manage their own portfolio, direct investment in individual stocks and ETFs can be a much lower-cost alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors**: Automated investment platforms (e.g., Wealthsimple) provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers**: For active management, professional portfolio managers offer customized strategies with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% (depending on portfolio size), often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Mutual funds are often structured to benefit banks rather than investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Investors do not have to accept underperformance, high fees, or poor transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

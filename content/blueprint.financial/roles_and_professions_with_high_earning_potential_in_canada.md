## Business Ownership

Another significant pathway to high wealth is through business ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Many of Canada's wealthiest individuals have built their fortunes by starting and scaling businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Examples include media, retail, finance, and technology tycoons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Business ownership offers substantial financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits such as selling the business or going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The ability to scale a business to reach hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers is a key factor in achieving significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## High-Performance Sales Roles

Certain sales roles also offer the potential to reach the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | top 1% income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These roles are often a hybrid between a salary and owning a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. High-performing sales professionals can earn substantial incomes through commissions, bonuses, and other incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Examples of such roles include:
*   Real Estate Agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Mortgage Brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
*   Pharmaceutical Sales Representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

Developing strong sales skills is considered a "superpower" that can immensely benefit any business or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Combining Strategies

Most individuals aiming for high income or wealth often combine these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. For instance, someone with a high-paying job might also focus on investing wisely and being frugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Alternatively, those who are risk-takers might start a scalable business and invest their profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. For individuals with family responsibilities, a focus on increasing salary through promotions or additional training combined with smart investing can be an effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

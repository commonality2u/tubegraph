This article details the journey of the founder from creating and eventually selling the personal finance blog, Wealth Awesome, to launching a new financial planning company, Blueprint Financial. It covers the motivations, growth, challenges, and lessons learned throughout this entrepreneurial shift.

## The Genesis of Wealth Awesome

In 2019, the founder launched the website Wealth Awesome.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The initial financial goal was to earn $3,000 a month from the website and attract 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This goal was eventually reached and exceeded by almost ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Motivations for [[starting_and_growing_a_finance_blog | starting the website]]

Several reasons compelled the founder to [[starting_and_growing_a_finance_blog | start the site]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:
*   **Digital Nomad Dream:** A long-held dream was to become a digital nomad, someone with an online income source allowing for global travel and remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Having spent time backpacking in Asia, the founder sought to build a life with this freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Creating Positive Impact:** There was a strong desire to create something beneficial that educated Canadians and provided a sense of purpose and joy by genuinely helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity:** The founder had experience writing for Canadian media and investment publications on finance topics, gaining tens of thousands of readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A friend suggested [[starting_and_growing_a_finance_blog | starting a personal financial education site]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Observing existing Canadian financial blogs, the founder felt capable of producing equally good or better content, possessing similar or greater education and experience in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This identified an opportunity to create great content, share the digital nomad journey, and indulge a love for writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The site officially launched in September 2019, a decision that "completely changed" the founder's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Growth and Earnings of Wealth Awesome

[[starting_and_growing_a_finance_blog | Earning income from blogging]] was not immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The first dollar was earned about a year after launch, in November 2020, as a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By then, over 150 articles had been written, and hundreds of hours invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This first earning provided significant validation that the idea would work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

The initial goal of $3,000 per month was achieved in February 2021, approximately a year and a half after the site's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. At its peak, the site earned over $20,000 a month, almost reaching $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In total, over $500,000 was earned from the website, excluding the confidential sale amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Income Generation Methods

Income was primarily generated through:
*   **Advertising:** Once a site reaches sufficient traffic, it can apply to premium ad networks. After hitting 50,000 visitors per month (now 10,000), the site joined Mediavine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Ad networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille), measuring earnings per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For finance content, RPMs were high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions:** Money was earned by recommending and referring products, specifically those the founder personally believed in and used, such as Well Simple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For example, an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms included links, leading to commissions of typically $50-$100 per sign-up, sometimes up to $150-$200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

These earnings far exceeded the initial $3,000 monthly goal, providing ample income for the digital nomad lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Website Traffic and Reach

The site started slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Traction began after about 100 articles and 11 months, reaching 5,000 visitors per month around August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. By January 2021, traffic surged tenfold to 50,000 visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. At its peak in 2022, Wealth Awesome had approximately 250,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Overall, the site welcomed about 5 million visitors throughout its operation, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. A connected YouTube channel also grew to nearly 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

*   Business-to-business sales experience helped promote the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Personal Growth
This was the founder's first significant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Key personal lessons included:
*   **Managing Challenges:** Learning to ride out bad results and persist with work, recognizing that things will break and results won't always go as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Mental Toughness:** Developing the ability to control reactions to uncontrollable events, accepting that not everything can be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck:** Acknowledging the role of fortunate timing, particularly starting the site just before the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased online activity and interest in personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling Wealth Awesome

The decision to sell the site was multi-faceted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>:
*   **Loss of Passion:** After several years, the founder began to lose passion for the daily tasks, finding it harder to produce "amazing content" and feeling less excited about the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. A key lesson learned was to move on when the "fire" is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of Blogging's Future:** Concerns arose regarding the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, causing stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The sale happened unexpectedly when a friend, Q, who had previously worked with the founder at CI Investments, reached out expressing interest in purchasing the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Q was building a portfolio of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The deal was finalized over a couple of weeks, with the founder being happy to sell to a trusted friend who could bring fresh ideas and manage the site effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The founder is passionate about Blueprint Financial, believing that most people haven't optimized their finances and that the company can provide "real value" to Canadians and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. After testing financial plans personally and with family, the immense value became clear, offering peace of mind and significant potential financial benefits for clients' retirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The company aims to [[setting_financial_goals_and_monitoring_progress | help people reach their financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

Achieving financial freedom and building wealth in Canada requires strategic planning, regardless of your current financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Net worth, which is the total value of assets minus liabilities, is the true indicator of financial freedom, rather than just income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Tracking your net worth helps in making smarter decisions and monitoring long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The Canadian population can be categorized into five general household net worth groups: Lower Class, Lower Middle Class, Middle Class, Upper Middle Class, and Upper Class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Strategies for wealth optimization vary significantly depending on which class you belong to.

*   **Build an Emergency Fund:** Start an emergency fund with at least three months of expenses to avoid accumulating further debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

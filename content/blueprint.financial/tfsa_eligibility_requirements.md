Eligibility for a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is determined by three primary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Core Eligibility Factors

*   **Age** You must be at least 18 years old to begin accumulating TFSA contribution room, though in some provinces, the age requirement is 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Residency** You must be a Canadian resident. Non-residents cannot accumulate new TFSA contribution room while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** A valid SIN is required to open and contribute to a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Impact of Eligibility on Contribution Room

Not everyone qualifies for the full cumulative TFSA limit, such as the [[tfsa_limit_increase_in_2025 | $102,000 limit in 2025]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The amount of contribution room depends on when you first became eligible for a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Examples of Eligibility Scenarios

*   **Eligible Since 2009:** If you turned 18 in 2009 and have been eligible since, you would have accumulated the full [[tfsa_limit_increase_in_2025 | $102,000]] in contribution room by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Even if no contributions were made, the full amount would be available for tax-free investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Turned 18 in 2015:** If you turned 18 in 2015, your TFSA contribution room accumulation started from that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. By 2025, you would have accumulated $72,000 in total contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Became a Canadian Resident in 2020:** If you moved to Canada and became a resident in 2020, your TFSA contribution room accumulation began from that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. By 2025, you would have $38,500 in available contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident Status:** If you were a Canadian resident and contributed to a TFSA but then moved abroad and became a non-resident (e.g., in 2019), you stop accumulating new contribution room from that point forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. While you can keep your existing TFSA, no additional contribution room is added while you remain a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Checking Your TFSA Contribution Room

To avoid overcontribution penalties, it's crucial to know your exact TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Overcontributing can result in a 1% monthly penalty on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Methods to check your TFSA contribution room include:
*   **Quick Estimate:** Calculating based on the yearly limits from your eligibility year, accounting for past contributions and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Online TFSA Calculators:** Using tools provided by Canadian publishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **CRA My Account:** Logging into your Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) My Account for an official number, though this figure won't reflect current-year transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Calling the CRA:** Contacting the CRA's tax information phone service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

It is recommended to track your own contributions and withdrawals throughout the year using tools like spreadsheets or budgeting apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

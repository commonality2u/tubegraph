Tax season involves more than just filing paperwork; it's about retaining your income. Certain common mistakes can be very costly, so understanding and avoiding them is crucial for a successful tax season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Top 10 Common Tax Filing Mistakes

### 1. Filing Late or Not Filing at All
Filing taxes late can result in significant financial penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: If taxes are owed, the CRA imposes a 5% penalty on the unpaid balance, plus an additional 1% per month until the amount is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Repeated late filing can lead to increased penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Delayed Benefits**: Even if no taxes are owed, late filing can delay tax refunds and benefits such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Set reminders well before the April 30th deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. File on time even if you cannot pay immediately to avoid penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### 2. Forgetting to Report All Income
The CRA cross-references your tax return with various income records like T4s and T5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Examples of Missed Income**: This includes employment income, rental income, side hustle earnings, and investment dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Modern Reporting**: Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now directly report income to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, which can trigger automatic reassessments for unreported earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current return and previously missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a 10% penalty on the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Always verify that all tax slips are included by checking your My CRA account before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Maintaining accurate records of all income sources helps prevent future tax surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### 3. Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs
Exceeding contribution limits for RRSPs or TFSAs can lead to penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: Excess RRSP contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty until withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_a_tfsa | TFSA]] contributions also incur a 1% monthly penalty on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Misconception**: Many assume the CRA will notify them of [[common_mistakes_like_overcontribution_and_using_tfsa_as_a_savings_account | overcontribution]], but penalties quietly accumulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Track your own contributions instead of solely relying on your My CRA account, as it may not be updated in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Withdraw any excess contributions promptly to minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: You can exceed your [[common_mistakes_in_rrsp_planning | RRSP]] limit by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties, providing a small buffer for contributions, but this buffer does not apply to [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investment | TFSAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 4. Missing Out on Deductions and Credits
Many Canadians overlook valuable tax deductions and credits that can reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Commonly Missed Deductions**:
    *   **Medical Expenses**: Prescription drugs, dental treatments, and travel costs for medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   **Moving Expenses**: If you moved for work or school in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   **Dues**: Union and professional membership dues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   **Tuition Credits**: Students often forget they can carry forward unused tuition credits or transfer them to a parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Review your eligibility for all deductions and credits. Always retain receipts and records, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### 5. Claiming Ineligible Write-Offs
The CRA strictly monitors business and employment deductions, and incorrect claims can lead to audits and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Home Office Expenses**: Deductions are only permitted if your workspace is your primary place of work or used exclusively for work-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Eligible expenses include utilities, rent, and internet for the dedicated portion of your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Business Expense Write-Offs**: Deductions for meals, travel, and vehicle costs must be reasonable, directly related to earning income, and supported by receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Personal expenses disguised as business costs will be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Paying Family Members**: If you employ a spouse or child, their salary must reflect actual work performed; unjustified payments may be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 6. Forgetting to Claim Capital Losses
If you've sold investments (like stocks or ETFs) or property at a loss, you might be able to use these losses to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Application**: The CRA allows capital losses to be carried forward indefinitely or applied to gains from the past three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Keep precise records of your investment transactions and report losses in the year they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Filing losses for future use, even without current gains, is a valuable tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### 7. Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency
Undisclosed foreign assets and cryptocurrency gains are on the CRA's radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Foreign Assets**: If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (stocks, real estate, offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Failure to do so can result in substantial penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency**: Unreported gains from selling or trading crypto can trigger a tax audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Some crypto exchanges now report transactions directly to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Maintain detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades, report all taxable gains, and adhere to correct tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### 8. Overlooking Income Splitting Opportunities
Income splitting can significantly reduce your household's overall tax burden, yet many Canadians do not utilize it due to perceived complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions**: The higher-earning spouse can contribute to the lower-earning spouse's RRSP, leading to tax savings in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting**: Retirees can split up to 50% of eligible pension income, lowering their combined tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Accounts**: Accounts like the TFSA and FHSA are excellent for income splitting as they are not subject to income attribution rules, allowing family members to contribute and grow investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 9. Failing to Pay Installments If Required
If you owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec), the CRA may require you to make quarterly tax installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Who is Affected**: This often applies to self-employed individuals, landlords, investors, and high-income earners (e.g., some commission salespeople) who do not have enough tax deducted at source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: Missing these payments leads to interest charges and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The CRA charges compound daily interest on unpaid amounts at a prescribed interest rate that can change quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. An additional penalty may apply if installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Set reminders and budget for timely and sufficient installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 10. Ignoring Tax Planning Until April
Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just a last-minute activity before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Year-End Deadlines**: Many tax-saving strategies, such as contributing to an FHSA, making charitable donations, and capital loss harvesting, must be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: Waiting until April means potentially missing out on deductions and scrambling to organize documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Prevention**: Business owners and investors should proactively plan for capital gains, tax-efficient withdrawals, and income splitting throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Schedule a tax review before year-end to optimize your strategy and avoid surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

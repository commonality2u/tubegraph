Many Canadian retirees may be leaving money on the table due to not properly managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals and failing to utilize their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08"></a>. By employing a strategic RSP-to-TFSA tactic, retirees can potentially reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and secure a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15"></a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue observed among Canadians, including retirees, is the underutilization of TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a>.

*   Out of 17.77% of Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) managed to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32"></a>. This indicates that the majority are missing out on the potential for tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43"></a>.
*   Many retirees enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53"></a>.
*   Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully [[maximizing_tfsa_contributions_for_taxfree_growth | maximize their TFSA contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04"></a>. For example, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% of them [[maximizing_tfsa_contributions_for_taxfree_growth | maximize contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.
*   Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before dropping slightly to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22"></a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances and Mandatory Withdrawals

While RSPs are excellent for saving during working years, withdrawals are taxed as income and can push individuals into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01"></a>. When an individual turns 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates the conversion of their RSP into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) and requires mandatory withdrawals, regardless of immediate financial need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07"></a>.

## The Strategy: Moving Excess RRIF Withdrawals to a TFSA

If retirees don't require their entire mandatory RRIF withdrawal for living expenses, a key strategy is to contribute the excess funds into their TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a>. This approach can lead to significant long-term tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23"></a>.

### Case Study: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, a 71-year-old who has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>.

*   The CRA requires Eddie to withdraw $30,000 annually, which is taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32"></a>.
*   If Eddie is in a 30% tax bracket, he owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37"></a>.
*   Eddie only needs $11,000 for his living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48"></a>.
*   This leaves Eddie with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57"></a>.
*   Instead of placing this excess income in a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a>.

#### Financial Benefits of TFSA vs. Taxable Accounts

Assuming an average annual growth rate of 6%:

*   **TFSA Growth:**
    *   Year 1: $10,000 grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32"></a>.
    *   After 10 years: Eddie contributes $100,000 in total, and his TFSA grows to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46"></a>.

*   **Non-Registered Account (Taxable) Growth:**
    *   If Eddie invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would still grow at 6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57"></a>.
    *   However, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, reducing the effective growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06"></a>.
    *   After 10 years: The non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes, significantly less than the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21"></a>.

*   **Taxable Savings Account Growth:**
    *   If the money were put into a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the growth would be much lower, potentially around $55,000 after 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31"></a>.

By consistently contributing his excess income to his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38"></a>. His TFSA balance grows to $132,000, compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, or even less in a low-interest savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46"></a>.

This approach not only [[using_tfsa_as_a_part_of_retirement_and_wealthbuilding_strategy | maximizes retirement savings]] but also provides flexibility to use the funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57"></a>.

## Pro Tips for Managing Retirement Income

*   Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14"></a>. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a portion of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20"></a>.
*   [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts]] in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25"></a>.

### Does this Strategy Eliminate RSP Taxes?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46"></a>. RSP withdrawals are still considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51"></a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56"></a>.

The goal is to minimize tax impact while [[the_role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | maximizing overall retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07"></a>. Retirement savings should work for you, not the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12"></a>.

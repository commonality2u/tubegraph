When considering a car purchase, whether to buy, lease, or finance, understanding car depreciation is crucial as it significantly impacts the financial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Understanding Car Depreciation

Car depreciation can be thought of as an iceberg: the new car driven off the lot is just the tip, but beneath the surface, a massive chunk of its value will melt away in the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year and 15% each year for the subsequent four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Estimating Car Depreciation

Estimating your car's depreciation is vital because it significantly influences the decision between leasing and buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Several methods can be used:

1.  **Research Average Depreciation Rates**
    *   This involves using general statistics, such as the typical 20% loss in the first year and 15% annually thereafter for new cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This method is often used in simplified financial examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
2.  **Utilize Online Depreciation Estimators**
    *   Websites like Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book provide free tools to estimate a car's depreciation based on its make, model, year, and mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
3.  **Check Current Marketplaces**
    *   This is a preferred method for gauging depreciation and market strength through hands-on research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. By checking sites like AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji for current listings of a car's make, model, and year, you gain real-time insight into its current value and how much it has depreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This method shows exactly what cars are being listed and sold for, rather than just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Depreciation's Role in Buy vs. Lease Calculations

Depreciation is considered the most important and unpredictable number in online calculators used to compare buying and leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

*   A **lower annual depreciation rate** (e.g., 10%) can significantly decrease the net cost of buying, making it much more favorable than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   A **higher annual depreciation rate** (e.g., 25%), often indicative of a less reliable vehicle, can drastically increase the net cost of buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The annual depreciation determines the actual market resale value of the car at the end of the term, which is challenging to predict as market prices depend heavily on supply and demand at that specific time, not just the vehicle's reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of cars caused used car prices to soar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   **High Resale Value:** If a vehicle is expected to have a high resale value, buying or financing it is generally more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value:** If a vehicle is predicted to have a low resale value, leasing becomes more cost-effective, especially if some payments can be written off for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## Unpredictability and Other Considerations

The unpredictability of the car market means that financial estimates, including depreciation and [[career_impact_on_financial_stability | opportunity cost]], are just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Because predicting the market is nearly impossible, [[nonfinancial_factors_when_choosing_to_lease_or_buy_a_car | non-financial factors]] might outweigh the financial ones in a buy or lease decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Benefits of Buying Used Cars

Given the significant impact of depreciation, buying a used car is often the smartest financial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

*   New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   By purchasing cars that are 3 to 5 years old, buyers can avoid this initial, steep depreciation hit and get more value for their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   Cars in this "sweet spot" are generally not old enough to have many major issues yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_buying_used_cars | Used cars]] also typically come with lower insurance costs and less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   With some research, a reliable, well-priced used car can be found that meets needs, often with better features or comparable ones to a new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

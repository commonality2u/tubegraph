While all-in-one ETFs are designed to simplify investing, investors can still make [[common_investment_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them | common mistakes]] that negatively impact their returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. It's important to be aware of these pitfalls to ensure your investment strategy remains effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Not Honestly Assessing Risk Tolerance
One of the most significant [[common_investment_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them | common mistakes]] is not answering investor questionnaires honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. If you're not truthful, you might end up in an ETF that doesn't match your actual comfort level with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

*   **Too Conservative:** Choosing an ETF that is too conservative may lead to insufficient growth for your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Too Aggressive:** Opting for an overly aggressive ETF means you might panic and sell during a market downturn, which is a common error seen by financial advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

It's crucial to take the risk tolerance questionnaire seriously to align your investment with your true comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Over-Tinkering and Getting Bored
The main [[benefits_of_allinone_etfs | benefit]] of all-in-one ETFs is their "set it and forget it" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. However, many investors frequently check their accounts and make unnecessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Constantly tweaking your investments or selling an all-in-one ETF due to market swings can significantly harm your long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Patience is key when it comes to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. As economist Paul Samuelson famously stated, investing should be "more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Over-Diversifying with Too Many ETFs
Some investors incorrectly believe they need extra diversification by buying multiple all-in-one ETFs or combining them with other ETFs in the same account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This approach actually disrupts the built-in balance of the all-in-one ETF and overcomplicates the strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

For instance, Vanguard's VGRO already includes exposure to over 13,000 companies worldwide, offering ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. All-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Adding more funds can interfere with the carefully designed asset allocation, potentially leading to more or less risk than intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It's best to choose one all-in-one ETF that aligns with your risk tolerance and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

> [!TIP]

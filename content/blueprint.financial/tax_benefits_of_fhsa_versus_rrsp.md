Canada's new First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is often considered superior to the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) in many cases, especially regarding tax benefits for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, there are specific situations where the RRSP still offers advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | Saving for a Home]]: Tax Implications

### FHSA for Home Savings

The FHSA allows contributions of up to $8,000 per year, with a maximum of $40,000 over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When funds are withdrawn for a home purchase, the full amount is tax-free, and no repayment is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This provides greater financial freedom and less stress during early home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For example, Paul contributed $40,000 over five years to his FHSA and withdrew the entire amount tax-free, with no obligation to repay it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

In contrast, the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) allows a tax-free withdrawal of up to $60,000 for a home purchase (recently increased from $35,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The key difference is that the withdrawn amount must be repaid over 15 years, starting five years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Missing a repayment means the missed amount is added to your taxable income for that year, increasing your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

> [!TIP] Winner: FHSA
> The FHSA is the winner for saving for a home due to its tax-free withdrawals and no repayment obligations, offering peace of mind for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Down Payment Potential: Tax Aspects

The FHSA offers the potential for a larger tax-free down payment. If Paul contributed $8,000 annually for five years ($40,000 total) and achieved a 6% annual return, his account could grow to approximately $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. If he left the money invested for an additional 10 years, his FHSA could grow to about $80,000, all of which would be tax-free upon withdrawal for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Under the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan, Paul could withdraw up to $60,000 tax-free, but this is a capped limit, and he would still need to repay it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

> [!TIP] Winner: FHSA
> The FHSA offers more flexibility and the potential for a larger tax-free down payment, especially if the funds are not immediately needed for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Overall Tax Benefits

### FHSA Tax Advantages

The FHSA provides a significant tax advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Contributions are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an upfront tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The primary benefit is that withdrawals used to buy a first home are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This creates a "double tax advantage" â€“ tax savings on contributions and again on withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

For instance, an $8,000 FHSA contribution could save about $2,000 in taxes, depending on the tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. If this account grows to $10,000, the entire amount is tax-free upon withdrawal for a home, with no repayment required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### RRSP Tax Advantages (Comparison)

RRSP contributions are also tax-deductible, offering upfront savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. While the HBP allows tax-free withdrawals up to $60,000, the crucial difference is the mandatory repayment over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. If a repayment is missed, the amount is added to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Ultimately, RRSP funds are taxed when fully withdrawn (e.g., in retirement), making the HBP function more like a "tax-free loan" from your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

> [!TIP] Winner: FHSA
> The FHSA is the winner for tax benefits, offering upfront tax savings, tax-free withdrawals, and the flexibility of no repayment, making it a simpler and more efficient choice for home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## [[investment_potential_in_fhsa_and_rrsp | Investment Potential]]

Both the FHSA and RRSP offer similar investment opportunities, allowing investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. A key shared benefit is tax-deferred growth, meaning no taxes are paid on investment gains as they grow, allowing for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The FHSA, despite its "savings account" label, functions as both a savings and investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

> [!TIP] Winner: Tie
> Both accounts offer the same powerful tax-deferred growth and investment opportunities, resulting in a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The main difference lies in how funds are withdrawn, not how they are invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## [[retirement_savings_considerations_with_fhsa_and_rrsp | Retirement Savings]]

While the RRSP is typically seen as the go-to for retirement due to its higher contribution limits, the FHSA offers a flexible alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Even if a home purchase isn't planned, the $40,000 FHSA balance can be transferred to an RRSP within 15 years without losing any tax advantages or contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This allows the FHSA to act as a bridge to the RRSP, offering the same growth potential with added flexibility for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

> [!TIP] Winner: FHSA
> The FHSA provides tax-free withdrawals for a home and the flexibility to roll into an RRSP, making it an ideal starting point for both home buyers and long-term retirement planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## [[situations_where_rrsp_is_advantageous_over_fhsa | Situations Where RRSP is Advantageous]]

There are two key [[situations_where_rrsp_is_advantageous_over_fhsa | situations where the RRSP is the smarter choice]] for tax reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>:

### US Stocks

When investing in US stocks, any dividends earned in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, significantly reducing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, with an RRSP, this tax is avoided entirely due to the US-Canada tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Invest in US Stocks through your RRSP, not your FHSA, to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Employer Matching

If your employer offers to match RRSP contributions, this is essentially "free money" that boosts your retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if an employer matches $5,000 in RRSP contributions, a $5,000 personal contribution results in a total of $10,000 in the RRSP for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

> [!TIP] Winner: RRSP
> The RRSP takes the lead when it comes to avoiding US dividend taxes and leveraging employer matching benefits, making it favorable for long-term investors and those with strong work benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

Overall, the FHSA typically wins in most categories over the RRSP, including flexibility, home savings, and tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The RRSP is generally prioritized only if heavily investing in US dividend stocks or receiving employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

This article explores average Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) balances across different demographics in Canada, including age, gender, and income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding these averages can help individuals assess their own savings progress and set financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Average TFSA Balances by Age

TFSA balances generally increase with age, reflecting consistent contributions and compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Under 20:** The average TFSA balance is approximately $3,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This is considered surprisingly high, especially as it includes only 18 and 19-year-olds who likely have limited income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **20 to 24:** The average balance jumps to about $6,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. By this age, many individuals have more stable income and make regular contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **25 to 29:** The average balance rises to about $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This age group often sees increased financial stability, career establishment, and consideration of long-term goals like buying a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **30 to 34:** The average balance is around $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **35 to 39:** The average balance further rises to approximately $15,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This period often involves focusing on larger financial goals such as starting a family, purchasing property, or building an emergency fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **40 to 44:** The average balance is approximately $17,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **45 to 49:** The average balance jumps to about $21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This is a crucial period for maximizing contributions as Canadians enter their peak earning years and retirement becomes a clearer reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **50 to 54:** The average balance is about $26,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **55 to 59:** The average jumps to about $33,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This is a critical time for serious retirement preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **60 to 64:** The average balance is close to $40,000, reflecting decades of compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **65 to 69:** The average balance reaches about $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Many Canadians utilize their TFSAs to cover retirement expenses without tax implications on withdrawals, making it a key part of their [[the_role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | retirement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Financial advisors often view the TFSA as a tool to control income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **70 to 74:** The average balance is approximately $49,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **75 to 79:** The average climbs to almost $54,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **80 and Over:** The highest average balances are observed, with the average nearing $56,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It is surprising that TFSA balances do not decrease for individuals aged 65 and over, suggesting that people, on average, do not draw down from their TFSAs even in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This behavior might not be optimal for tax planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> It is important to remember that these are *average* balances, which can be influenced by a few very large accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Median balances, which better reflect what a typical person has saved, were not available but would likely be much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The main takeaway is that starting early and contributing consistently makes a significant impact over time due to tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Average TFSA Balances by Gender

[[gender_differences_in_tfsa_savings | Women tend to save more than men in their TFSAs]] at nearly every age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

*   **Under 20:** Women's average balance is close to $4,000, compared to approximately $3,000 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This is notable given that both groups likely earn limited income at this age, suggesting women may start saving earlier and develop stronger financial habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **20 to 24:** Women save about $7,000 on average, while men save approximately $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Late 20s:** The gender gap persists, with women's balances reaching about $11,264, while men's stand at around $10,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **30s:** The gap nearly closes, with men slightly ahead in the 30 to 34 age group, holding $13,920 compared to women's $13,716 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This could be where the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age_group | gender income gap]] begins to influence savings ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **40s and 50s:** Women begin to pull ahead again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. In the 40 to 49 age group, women hold an average of about $21,680 compared to $20,640 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. By ages 50 to 54, women lead with $27,000 while men have around $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This may reflect a more conservative approach to spending and saving, along with a focus on long-term financial security as retirement nears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **60s:** The gap remains, with women aged 60 to 64 holding about $41,240 compared to $39,182 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This continued trend could be attributed to longer life expectancy and a more cautious withdrawal strategy in retirement among women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Despite the persistent income gap in Canada—where men earned an average of 36% more than women in 2022 ($66,000 for men vs. $48,000 for women)—women maintain higher average TFSA balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This suggests women prioritize savings and make strategic financial decisions, possibly due to conservative spending habits, a focus on long-term security, and lower-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. These trends demonstrate that how one saves can often matter more than how much one earns, with smart financial habits leading to significant long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Average TFSA Balances by Income Level

[[tfsa_savings_comparisons_by_income_level | Even low earners make good use of their TFSAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **$1 to $4,999 per year:** Canadians in this bracket have an average TFSA balance of close to $19,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, which is surprisingly high given their extremely low income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **$5,000 to $9,999 per year:** The average TFSA balance is $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **$10,000 to $19,999 per year:** The estimated average TFSA balance is $20,456 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It is impressive that Canadians at the lowest income levels prioritize their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **$20,000 to $49,999 per year (middle-income):** TFSA balances remain fairly steady, ranging from about $28,000 to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **$50,000 to $74,999 per year:** The estimated average TFSA balance is just shy of $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **$75,000 to $99,999 per year:** Average TFSA balances are about $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **$100,000 to $150,000 per year:** Balances reach close to $36,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Over $150,000 and $250,000+ per year (top earners):** Dramatic jumps are observed, with average balances of $46,000 and $63,000 respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

A surprising aspect of this data is the similarity in balances between those earning $25,000 and $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Despite the wide income range, their average balances are very close, suggesting that many middle-income Canadians are maximizing their TFSAs despite having less disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This highlights the value of TFSAs for all income levels, not just high earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## How to Use TFSA Data to Boost Your Finances

This data can be leveraged to enhance personal financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

1.  **Motivate Your Own Savings:** Compare your TFSA balances to the averages for your age, gender, and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. For example, if you are aged 30 to 34, the average TFSA balance is about $14,000, growing to $40,000 by age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Use these benchmarks to evaluate your position and set realistic, achievable savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
2.  **Start Early to Maximize Compounding:** The earlier you begin contributing, the greater the impact of compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Even a small TFSA balance in your 20s can grow substantially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Make consistent contributions a habit, as consistency leads to significant growth by retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
3.  **Plan for Retirement with Your TFSA:** TFSAs are not just for short-term savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Integrate them into your overall [[the_role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | retirement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Canadians in their 60s often have high TFSA balances, providing a valuable tax-free income source in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Aim to build your TFSA for future financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
4.  **Build Wealth Regardless of Income:** You do not need a high income to benefit from a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Canadians earning between $25,000 to $30,000 per year maintain average balances close to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Focusing on small, consistent contributions allows even lower earners to accumulate significant savings over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
5.  **Make Your TFSA Central to Your Financial Plan:** Whether you earn $25,000 or $250,000, the TFSA is a powerful tool for growing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. High earners can shelter more money from taxes, while middle-income Canadians can consistently build savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Prioritize your TFSA as a key component of your overall wealth-building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
6.  **Focus on Progress, Not Comparison:** While comparisons can be motivating, the real success lies in personal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. What truly counts is the consistent effort to build wealth, as every dollar saved moves you closer to your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

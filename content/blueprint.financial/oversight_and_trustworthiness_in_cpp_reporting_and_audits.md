Concerns about the future availability of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) are common, with 64% of Canadians believing it won't be there when they retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the CPP is structured with multiple layers of oversight to ensure its financial reports and audits are trustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Safeguards in Place
The CPP incorporates several safeguards to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its financial assessments, distinguishing it from past financial scandals like Enron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Chief Actuary of Canada
The Chief Actuary of Canada is responsible for providing impartial assessments of the CPP's long-term financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This office operates independently, free from political influence, ensuring reports are accurate and free from external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The 31st Actuarial report, completed in 2022, confirmed the [[cpp_sustainability_and_financial_planning|CPP's sustainability]] for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)
Further scrutiny is provided by the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO), who reviews the reports prepared by the Chief Actuary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The PBO is known for its independence, transparency, and nonpartisan approach, serving as a reliable source of oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Their main function is to deliver objective, factual analysis and confirm that financial data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### External Audits
External audits provide additional assurance regarding the CPP's financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. For example, Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments|CPP Investments]] maintained effective internal control over financial reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Summary of Oversight Layers
With the Chief Actuary and the PBO providing independent oversight, and external audits confirming findings, there are strong reasons to trust the transparency and reliability of CPP reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. While the possibility of a vast government conspiracy and audit failures exists, the multiple layers of scrutiny and transparency make the CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Implications for Canadians
For the average Canadian, the trustworthiness of the CPP's reports offers peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Knowing that the CPP is reviewed by multiple independent bodies, thoroughly audited, and projected to remain solvent for at least 75 years, means that concerns about it running out of money are likely unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> When evaluating financial reports, whether for a pension fund or a company, always seek independent audits or third-party reviews to make informed decisions with trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

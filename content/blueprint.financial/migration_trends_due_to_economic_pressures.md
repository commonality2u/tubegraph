A significant [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | cost of living crisis]] is impacting Canada, leading many to consider relocation. Approximately 50% of Canadians are living paycheck to paycheck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Social media is replete with accounts of individuals struggling financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Driving Factors

### Soaring Living Costs
The primary driver behind these migration considerations is the rapidly increasing [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

*   **Food Expenses**: In March 2021, a basket of 18 household items cost $82. By July 2024, that same basket cost $113.32, a 38.2% increase in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The Canada Food Price Report predicts a $701 increase in the average family of four's annual food bill this year, bringing the total to $16,295, following a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | Food prices]] have consistently outpaced the average rate of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **[[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | Rental and housing costs]]**:
    *   **Rent**: In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month. By July 2024, it averaged $3,648 per month, representing a 40% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   **Housing Purchase**: The average cost to buy a house in Canada was $413,000 in 2015. By May 2024, this had skyrocketed to $699,000, a 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Other Expenses**: Beyond [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | housing]] and [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | food costs]], transportation, entertainment, and general everyday items have also seen significant price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Stagnant Income Growth
Unfortunately, [[income_growth_and_employment_challenges | income growth]] has not kept pace with the rising [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals decreased from $73,000 in 2021 to $70,500 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Average wages have likely not increased sufficiently in 2023 or 2024 to match inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs have further strained finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Widespread Unhappiness
The latest World Happiness Report ranks Canada as the 15th happiest country overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, Canadians under age 30 fall to 58th place, highlighting a significant disparity in happiness levels among younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Migration Trends

### Recent Immigrants
A shocking 40% of recent immigrants are considering [[effects_of_relocating_on_Canadian_retirement_savings_and_benefits | moving to another Province]] or [[effects_of_relocating_on_Canadian_retirement_savings_and_benefits | leaving Canada entirely]], primarily due to the [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | high cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Interprovincial Migration
Approximately 28% of all Canadians are contemplating [[effects_of_relocating_on_Canadian_retirement_savings_and_benefits | moving to another Province]] because of high [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | housing]] costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Young adults and renters are the most likely demographics to consider such a move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

This trend is particularly evident in Ontario and British Columbia, where [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | high housing costs]] have persisted for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Popular relocation destinations include Alberta, with 18% of Canadians considering a move there due to more affordable [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | housing]] and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Between 2022 and 2023, net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

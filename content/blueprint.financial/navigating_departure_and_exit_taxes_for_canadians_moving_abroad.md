Many Canadians are choosing to leave the country, but escaping Canadian taxes requires careful planning to avoid significant financial penalties from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Failure to properly manage your tax obligations when leaving Canada can lead to unexpected costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This article outlines common tax mistakes and how to avoid them when relocating abroad.

## Understanding Canadian Tax Residency Status When Relocating

Canada taxes individuals based on their residency status, not solely on citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. If you do not clearly establish your residency status when leaving, you may still be considered a Canadian tax resident and owe taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. The CRA views tax residency like an "umbilical cord" that must be properly severed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

There are four main types of tax residency status for individuals considering moving countries:

*   **Factual Resident**: Someone who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties to the country, even if temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Emigrant**: An individual who leaves Canada permanently and severs significant residential ties with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The CRA considers someone an emigrant for tax purposes if they establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident**: An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Non-residents do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but may be taxed on Canadian-sourced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   **Deemed Non-Resident**: Occurs when you qualify as a tax resident in another country with a tax treaty, meaning Canada will not tax you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. While the determination differs, both non-residents and deemed non-residents are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Snowbird Alert
> If you spend more than 183 days in the US during a calendar year, you could be classified as a US tax resident and be subject to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. It is crucial to track your days, potentially using apps like Day Count or Tax Bird, to avoid exceeding this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Ignoring Departure Tax (Exit Tax)

When leaving Canada, you may be subject to a departure tax, also known as exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This tax treats certain assets as if they were sold at fair market value on the day you leave, potentially triggering capital gains tax even if no actual sale occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### Assets Subject to Departure Tax

*   Stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and other investments in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   Private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   Foreign real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Assets Not Subject to Departure Tax

*   Canadian real estate owned personally, which is taxable only when sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   Registered accounts like Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Note that you cannot contribute to these accounts after leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

> [!example] Alex's Departure Tax
> Alex, a Canadian resident, moves permanently to Portugal and severs his tax ties with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. He holds stocks in a non-registered account and private company shares, both subject to departure tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. His TFSA, RRSP, employer pension plan, and Canadian home are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
>
> Upon his departure, the CRA deems his stocks and private company shares as sold at fair market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, triggering capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>:
> *   Stocks: $80,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>
> *   Private Company Shares: $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>
> *   Total Capital Gains: $280,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>
>
> With a 50% inclusion rate, his taxable capital gain is $140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. At a 27% tax rate, Alex owes approximately $37,800 in departure tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### Strategies to Reduce or Defer Departure Taxes

*   **Sell Assets Before Leaving**: Consider selling assets with accrued gains before departure to avoid the deemed disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This is particularly effective if you have several years to plan your exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
*   **Use Capital Losses**: Offset taxable capital gains with available capital losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
*   **Gift or Transfer Assets**: Consider gifting or transferring assets to family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
*   **Defer Departure Tax**: It may be possible to defer departure tax if you plan to return to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Filing Form NR73 (Residency Determination Form)

Many assume that filing Form NR73, the residency determination form, will confirm their non-resident status with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. However, this form can sometimes work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. A CRA official reviews your case upon submission, and they may determine you are still a Canadian tax resident, even if you believe you have fully cut ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. This could result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

### What to Do Instead

*   **Skip Form NR73**: It is not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **File a Departure Tax Return**: Report your departure date and pay any applicable exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Let Your Actions Prove Non-Residency**: Sever significant ties to Canada, such as selling or renting out your home, closing Canadian bank accounts, cancelling provincial health insurance, and establishing tax residency in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Not Checking Tax Treaties and Tiebreaker Rules

When [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | relocating from Canada]], it's crucial to understand how tax treaties affect your tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. Many countries have tax treaties with Canada that include tiebreaker rules to determine residency when both countries could claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

### How Tax Treaties Determine Residency

If your new country has a tax treaty with Canada, the following criteria are typically used to resolve dual residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>:

1.  **Permanent Home**: Where do you have a permanent place of residence? If you have a permanent home in both countries, the next criterion is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Center of Vital Interests**: Where are your personal and economic ties strongest? This includes factors like family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>.
3.  **Habitual Abode**: In which country do you habitually reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>?
4.  **Physical Presence (183-Day Rule)**: Some countries automatically consider you a tax resident if you spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

> [!example] Moving to the US: Tiffany's Situation
> The US employs a substantial presence test, where spending 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year can lead to being considered a US tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. However, the Canada-US tax treaty tiebreaker rules can resolve dual residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
>
> Tiffany, a Canadian citizen, accepts a one-year job in New York, spending over 183 days in the US, thus qualifying her as a US tax resident under the substantial presence test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. However, her primary ties remain in Canada:
> *   **Permanent Home**: She owns a condo in Toronto where her family lives, and she rents an apartment in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
> *   **Center of Vital Interests**: Her family and financial ties remain in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
> *   **Habitual Abode**: She intends to return to Canada after one year, indicating her long-term residency remains Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
> *   **Citizenship**: Her Canadian citizenship further favors Canada as her tax residency if uncertainty persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
>
> **Outcome**: Canada remains Tiffany's primary tax residency under the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. While the US may tax her US-sourced income, she can avoid being fully taxed as a US resident on her worldwide income, such as investments or rental properties in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Significant Ties to Canada

The CRA assesses your residential ties to determine if you remain a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Failure to properly sever these ties can result in continued taxation on your worldwide income after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

### Primary Residential Ties (Strongest Indicators of Residency)

*   **Home in Canada**: Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada**: If they remain in Canada, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada**: Children or other dependents living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

### Secondary Residential Ties (May Influence Residency Status)

*   **Personal Property**: Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.
*   **Social Ties**: Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Ties**: Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Canadian Documentation**: Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Mailing Address**: Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can contribute to being classified as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### How to Sever Residential Ties

To confirm non-residency, consider these actions:

*   **Sell or Rent Out Canadian Home**: Leasing to unrelated parties demonstrates you have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Move Your Family Abroad**: Bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Close or Convert Canadian Financial Accounts**: Terminate accounts or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Update Government Records**: Change your address, cancel health coverage, and surrender your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

## Not Planning for Tax on Canadian Income for Nonresidents

Even after leaving Canada, certain Canadian-sourced incomes can remain taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Understanding these obligations is crucial to avoid unexpected liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. This is part of [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | tax implications on Canadian income for nonresidents]].

### Types of Taxable Canadian Income for Non-Residents

*   **Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS)**: Generally subject to a 25% withholding tax for non-residents, though tax treaties can reduce this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. This is part of [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | implications of moving abroad on Canadian retirement benefits]].
*   **Rental Income from Canadian Property**: Non-residents are typically subject to a 25% withholding tax on the *gross* rental amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. This falls under [[financial_strategies_for_managing_property_and_tax_implications_when_leaving_canada | financial strategies for managing property and tax implications when leaving Canada]].
*   **RRSP Withdrawals**: Generally subject to a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### Strategies to Reduce Withholding Tax

*   **File Form NR5**: Non-residents can apply for a lower withholding tax rate on certain income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. If approved, taxes are withheld at a reduced rate based on expected Canadian tax liability for up to 5 years, but you must file a Canadian tax return annually to maintain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
*   **Elect Under Section 216 (for Rental Income)**: Non-residents can choose to pay tax on *net* rental income (gross income minus expenses) instead of the standard 25% withholding on gross income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. This usually results in a lower tax liability and allows for deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. A Section 216 tax return must be filed annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaty Considerations**: Withholding tax rates vary by country under Canada's tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Always check if your new country has a tax treaty with Canada that automatically lowers your withholding tax before filing NR5 or Section 216 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. For example, moving to the US generally leads to lower CPP, OAS, and RRSP withholding tax rates than the 25% standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

Managing rental properties and other income sources in Canada as a non-resident can involve significant ongoing paperwork, tax obligations, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>.

## Not Establishing Residency in a New Country Properly

Failing to secure legal residency in another country can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. If you leave Canada without establishing official tax residency elsewhere, you may remain liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. This is part of [[visa_options_for_canadians_moving_abroad | visa options for Canadians moving abroad]].

### Steps to Properly Establish Residency Elsewhere

*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency**: Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.
*   **Set Up Financial Ties**: Open a bank account, rent or buy a house, obtain an ID card, and register for health insurance in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in Your New Country**: Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Leaving Canada does not mean leaving taxes behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. Without proper [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | financial planning]], you could end up paying thousands more than necessary or even face double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. Tax law is complex in one country, and it becomes exponentially harder when two tax systems are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

While the FHSA is often the preferred account for first-time home buyers in Canada due to its flexibility and tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, there are two specific situations where the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) proves to be the smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Investing in US Stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>

When investing in US stocks, the RRSP offers a significant tax advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Dividends earned from US stocks held within an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This tax can substantially reduce investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Conversely, the RRSP is exempt from this withholding tax due to the US-Canada tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> To bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends, invest in US stocks through your RRSP, not your FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Employer Matching Contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>

Another key advantage of the RRSP is the availability of employer matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. If an employer offers to match RRSP contributions, this represents "free money" that can significantly boost retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

For example, if an employer matches RRSP contributions up to $5,000 per year, contributing $5,000 to an RRSP would result in an additional $5,000 from the employer, totaling $10,000 for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This is a substantial benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Therefore, if employer matching is available, the RRSP is the clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

The RRSP takes the lead for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> and those with strong work benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> when it comes to avoiding US dividend taxes and taking advantage of employer matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Prioritizing an RRSP makes more sense if heavily investing in US dividend stocks or receiving employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

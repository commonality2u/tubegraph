While many Canadians believe government pensions like the [[cpp_contributions_and_retirement_planning_for_immigrants | CPP]] (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) are guaranteed, immigrants often face unique challenges that can significantly alter their payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Factors such as when one moves to Canada or where they choose to retire can impact these government benefits permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

[[impact_of_canadian_residency_on_oas_benefits | OAS eligibility and tax considerations for nonresidents]] is not automatic and is entirely based on residency in Canada after the age of 18, unlike the CPP which is based on working contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Many individuals are surprised to find they don't qualify for the full amount, or any at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

Key residency requirements for OAS:
*   **10 years in Canada after age 18:** This is the bare minimum to receive any OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **40 years in Canada after age 18:** Required to qualify for the full OAS payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **20 years in Canada after age 18:** Essential for immigrants who plan to retire abroad, as this minimum is needed to continue receiving OAS outside the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Impact of Late Arrival
If an immigrant arrives in Canada at age 50 and retires at 65, they will have only 15 years of residency after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This would result in receiving only 15 out of 40 years of OAS payments, which is approximately 37.5% of the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A significant risk is losing OAS entirely if one moves back to their home country without meeting the 20-year minimum, depending on the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements
Canada has international social security agreements with many countries, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These agreements can assist in qualifying for OAS even if the full time hasn't been spent in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For example, living 7 years in Canada and 13 years in the UK might still qualify an individual for OAS under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

These agreements allow Canada to count time spent in certain other countries towards the 10 or 20-year residency minimums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. However, it's crucial to note that they do not count towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS, meaning only partial OAS will likely be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

Unlike OAS, [[cpp_contributions_and_retirement_planning_for_immigrants | CPP]] is entirely based on how much and how long an individual has worked and contributed, rather than the length of Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Someone could live in Canada for 40 years without working and receive no CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

To receive the [[maximum_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_different_scenarios | maximum CPP]], approximately 39 years of maximum contributions between the ages of 18 and 65 are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This target is often difficult for immigrants who arrive later in life to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Common reasons why many immigrants receive less CPP:
*   **Late Arrival:** Immigrating to Canada at age 45 and retiring at 65 provides only 20 working years, insufficient to meet the 39-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Career Transitions:** Many immigrants return to school, start in lower-paying jobs, or run businesses that may not always contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Contribution Gaps:** Periods of unemployment or part-time work reduce the average contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   CPP uses the best 39 years of contributions to calculate benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   The "general dropout provision" allows for dropping up to 8 years of low or no income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   However, 31 years still count, and if these are not met, the CPP payout shrinks, even for those who earned a high income during their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

A Canadian-born worker starting CPP at age 65 might expect $10,000 to $15,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. An immigrant who arrived at age 45 might receive only $3,000 to $6,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Even if qualified, CPP might be minimal if working years in Canada were insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a crucial lifeline for many low-income seniors, potentially adding up to approximately $13,000 per year tax-free on top of OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

A significant challenge for immigrants is that GIS is paid only while living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. If an individual leaves the country for more than six consecutive months, their GIS is cut off, even if their income remains low and Canadian taxes are filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This particularly impacts immigrants who plan to retire abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

For instance, a 71-year-old retiree who moved to Mexico found her GIS stopped after 6 months, despite her CPP continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. There is no workaround, international agreement, or tax treaty to protect GIS in this situation; it is strictly tied to living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Snowbird Strategy
> Some retirees use a "snowbird strategy" by staying in Canada for at least 183 days a year to retain benefits like GIS and healthcare, while spending the rest of the time abroad (e.g., Florida or Mexico) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## What's at Stake: The Value of Government Benefits

[[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | CPP and OAS]] are extremely valuable, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The timing of when one starts CPP also makes a huge difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

*   The average Canadian starting CPP at age 65 receives around $9,696 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   Those who max out contributions at 65 could receive up to about $17,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   For those who fully qualify for OAS at ages 65 to 74, it amounts to almost $9,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Over a 25-year retirement, these benefits could add up to between $460,000 and $648,000, assuming maximum OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. These figures do not include inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. CPP and OAS are inflation-indexed, meaning they increase with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. With a modest 2% annual increase, indexed benefits could grow significantly, potentially reaching $580,000 to $815,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This represents an additional $100,000 to $170,000 simply by factoring in modest inflation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

Without personal savings or a pension, government benefits alone could be worth over $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. However, if an individual immigrated to Canada later in life or retires abroad, they might receive only a fraction of this, or even lose their OAS entirely, resulting in a massive difference in retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Strategies for Immigrants to Protect Benefits

Even if an immigrant doesn't qualify for full CPP or GIS, there are powerful strategies to consider:

*   **Delay CPP and OAS if possible:** This is one of the easiest ways to boost monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Delaying CPP or OAS until age 70 can increase the benefit by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This is a significant difference over the course of retirement and is a powerful lever for those who can afford to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For more information, see [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Optimal timing for CPP and OAS benefits]] and [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | Strategies to delay CPP and OAS for higher benefits]].
*   **Build personal retirement income:** Do not rely solely on government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Focus on RRSPs, TFSAs, and other personal savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Side income can also be beneficial in retirement, especially if government benefits are lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This is part of [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | Strategies to supplement CPP and OAS income]].
*   **Check for social security agreements:** Approximately 50 countries have social security agreements with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. These can help qualify for partial OAS or CPP even if the full 20 years of residency haven't been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Countries like the UK, India, the Philippines, and many in Europe are on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. If close to the 20-year OAS portability threshold and planning to retire in a country without an agreement, delaying the move for a couple of years might be beneficial, potentially meaning hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Know the residency rules before leaving:** If considering retiring abroad, understand how long you've lived in Canada and that OAS will cease if you leave for more than 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Plan carefully and get help:** Immigrants who moved to Canada later in life or plan to retire abroad operate under a different set of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. With the right strategy, comfortable retirement and potential tax savings are still possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Smart planning moves include:
*   Coordinating RRSP and TFSA withdrawals to reduce taxable income and avoid OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   Planning for a delayed OAS and CPP withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Using income splitting with a spouse or family member to lower the overall tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   Strategically converting RRSPs to RRIFs to avoid forced withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   Being mindful of foreign exchange risk and how investment income will be taxed in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

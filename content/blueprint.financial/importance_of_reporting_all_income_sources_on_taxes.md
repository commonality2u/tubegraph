Accurately reporting all income sources is a critical aspect of [[common_tax_filing_mistakes_to_avoid | tax filing]] to ensure compliance and avoid penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has extensive access to financial records and cross-checks these against submitted tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Why Reporting All Income Matters

The CRA accesses various records, including T4s (employment income), T5s (investment income), and other income slips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. They compare this information with your tax return to identify discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Forgetting to report income sources such as:
*   Employment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Side hustle earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Investment dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

...can lead to penalties and a potential audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Even income from platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy is now reported directly to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Unreported earnings from these sources can trigger an automatic reassessment of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Penalties for Unreported Income

If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return, and have also missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This penalty is 10% of the unreported income, split as 5% federally and 5% provincially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. To avoid these penalties, all income sources must be accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Ensuring Compliance

To prevent issues with the CRA and costly tax surprises:
*   **Check My CRA Account** Before filing, always check your My CRA account to confirm all tax slips, such as T4s and T5s, are included and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Keep Accurate Records** Maintain detailed records of all income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Utilizing Autofill My Return

Tools like "Autofill My Return," built into NetFile certified tax software (e.g., TurboTax, Well Simple Tax), can help simplify the tax filing process and reduce errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

How it works:
1.  **Instant Slip Import** By logging into your My CRA account and connecting it to your tax software, Autofill can automatically import T4s, T5s, RRSP contributions, and other tax slips directly from the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Prevents Audit Triggers** This feature helps prevent common mistakes, like forgetting to report a second job, dividend payment, or side hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Since the CRA already possesses this information, Autofill ensures your return matches what the CRA expects, avoiding reassessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
3.  **Saves Time and Finds Credits** It eliminates manual data entry and helps identify potentially missed credits and deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

To use it, simply log into your My CRA account before filing, connect your tax software, and import your slips with one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This reduces manual entry and potential mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

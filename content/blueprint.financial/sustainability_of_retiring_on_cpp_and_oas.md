Many Canadians hope that the [[Canadian Pension Plan sustainability | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and [[Impact of delaying CPP and OAS on benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] will be sufficient for their retirement, but this often proves challenging in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article breaks down the typical income from these benefits and explores what life relying solely on them entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Understanding CPP (Canada Pension Plan)

The CPP is based on an individual's lifetime earnings; greater contributions during working years lead to higher payouts in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. However, most individuals do not receive the [[Maximum CPP and OAS benefits in different scenarios | maximum amount]] due to the requirement of decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### CPP Payouts (2025 Estimates)

| Age to Start CPP | Average Monthly Payment | Maximum Monthly Payment |
| :--------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| 60               | ~$517                   | ~$917                   |
| 65               | ~$808                   | ~$1,433                 |
| 70               | ~$1,147                 | ~$2,034                 |
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

Delaying CPP collection significantly increases monthly payments; waiting until age 70 can boost benefits by over 40% compared to starting at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It's crucial to be able to afford this delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. CPP is designed to replace approximately 25% to 33% of working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For more information on maximizing benefits, an additional resource is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Understanding OAS (Old Age Security)

The OAS pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have resided in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not tied to employment income or work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, the amount received can vary based on residency, income, and deferral choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### OAS Maximum Monthly Payments (March 2025 Estimates)

*   **Ages 65-74:** ~$727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **Ages 75 and older:** ~$800 (a 10% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed and adjusted quarterly (January, April, July, October) based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

For seniors with very low total income, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) may be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. In 2024, the maximum GIS for single seniors with no other income is $900 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Any additional income, even small RRSP withdrawals, can reduce GIS eligibility on a dollar-for-dollar basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Total Estimated Income from Government Benefits

Without other income sources, a retiree's total monthly income from government benefits might be around $2,000, combining average CPP ($800), OAS ($700), and GIS ($500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Notably, OAS does not count towards GIS income calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Living on approximately $2,000 per month is barely above the poverty line, making it an uncomfortable retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## [[Cost breakdown of living on CPP and OAS | Cost of Living Breakdown in Canada]]

While technically possible, living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada requires significant sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Major Expenses

*   **Housing:**
    *   **Owned Home:** Costs could be $500+ per month for property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, even if the mortgage is paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Rent:** In smaller cities, rent starts at around $1,000 per month, consuming over half of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Major cities like Toronto or Vancouver often have one-bedroom rents exceeding $2,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries:** A basic grocery budget for a single senior ranges from $300 to $500 per month, with eating out being a rare luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs:** For those under 65 without provincial coverage, private insurance may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can become major expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation:** Monthly costs for electricity, heating, internet, and phone are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership adds $200-$500 per month for insurance, gas, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, while public transit can be $100+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations

Relying solely on CPP and OAS typically means:
*   No travel budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   No budget for major purchases like furniture, appliances, or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   Living month-to-month, with no emergency fund, potentially requiring reliance on family, food banks, or community support for unexpected bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This income provides a barebones lifestyle, making it difficult to enjoy "golden years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## When Retiring on CPP and OAS *Could* Work

While challenging, relying on CPP and OAS alone might be feasible in specific scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:

*   **Owning a Home Outright:** Eliminating mortgage or rent significantly lowers expenses, potentially allowing access to equity through borrowing or downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Living in a Low-Cost Area:** Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs:** Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch a limited budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Receiving Extra Support:** Help from family, additional investment income, or a part-time job can make a substantial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree in small-town Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## When Retiring on CPP and OAS *Falls Apart*

For most retirees, relying solely on these benefits is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:

*   **Major City Costs:** High living expenses in major cities make survival difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses:** Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **No Savings/Safety Net:** Without emergency funds, every month is a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement constantly worrying about money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This highlights the [[Retirement income challenges in Canada | retirement income challenges in Canada]].

## Strategies to Bridge the Gap

If CPP and OAS are not enough, several strategies can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>:

*   **Delay CPP and OAS:** Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70 (CPP grows by 42%, OAS by 36% from initial eligibility to age 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This directly impacts the [[Impact of delaying CPP and OAS on benefits | impact of delaying CPP and OAS on benefits]].
*   **Part-Time Work or Delayed Retirement:** Continuing to work part-time or delaying full retirement can help ensure money lasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs:** Downsizing a home frees up capital, and relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or even abroad makes money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Utilize Government Benefits:** Programs like the Allowance for the Survivor provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Planning:** Income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) withdrawal strategies can lower the tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These are key [[Retirement Strategies Integrating CPP | retirement strategies]].

## Creative Retirement Strategies

Some retirees on limited incomes employ innovative approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>:

*   **House Hacking:** Renting out part of a home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming house-sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Turning Hobbies into Income:** Monetizing skills through teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming local tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements:** Programs like TrustedHousesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement:** A growing trend involves slow travel through low-cost countries, leveraging extended tourist visas to live for months where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Personal experiences include a retiree in Mexico living on ~$1,500 a month ($600 rent, eating out daily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, and others house-sitting in Europe and the US to lower living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The [[Impact of retiring outside Canada on Canadian benefits | impact of retiring outside Canada on Canadian benefits]] is a complex topic that warrants further exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal can offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This lifestyle is typically embraced by active and healthy seniors in their 60s or early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Relying solely on CPP and OAS without a backup plan can lead to a challenging retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Early planning is crucial; the sooner financial problems are addressed, the more options are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Creating a customized retirement strategy, including maximizing government benefits, lowering taxes, and building investment portfolios, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## RSP Income Splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

One strategy to minimize the tax burden on your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) at death is [[income_splitting_strategies_for_couples | income splitting]] through a spousal RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
The higher-earning spouse contributes to a spousal RSP in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The lower-income spouse can then withdraw these funds gradually in retirement, which helps lower the overall RSP balance and reduces the large tax hit when the RSP holder passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Example: Mark and Susan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>
*   Mark is in a 45% tax bracket, while his wife Susan will be in a 20% tax bracket when she retires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   Mark contributes $20,000 annually into Susan's spousal RSP over the years, receiving a tax deduction for his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   In retirement, Susan withdraws $40,000 per year from her spousal RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. These withdrawals are taxed at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   This approach helps the couple save taxes during retirement and reduces the overall balance of Mark's RSP by the time he passes away, leading to a much smaller tax hit on death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

> [!success] Pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>
> *   **Reduces RSP balance at death**: Shifting withdrawals to a lower-income spouse reduces the RSP balance, lowering the tax bill when one spouse passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
> *   **Tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement**: Lowers the tax hit both during life and at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

> [!warning] Cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
> *   **Only effective with income disparity**: This strategy is only effective if one spouse is in a lower income bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
> *   **Requires careful planning**: It requires careful planning and contributions to the spousal RSP over time to see maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Individual Pension Plan (IPP) for Business Owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>

An Individual Pension Plan (IPP) offers a tax-efficient way for business owners to transfer wealth to the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
Unlike an RSP, which is fully taxed as income upon death, an IPP allows you to add your children onto the plan, effectively passing the plan onto them when you pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The IPP is taken over by your children, avoiding the large immediate tax hit that occurs with RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Instead, they are only taxed as they withdraw the funds, spreading that tax liability over many years and generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Example: Paul, Jason, and Emma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
*   Paul, a business owner, has a $500,000 RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   He transfers these RSP funds into an IPP and contributes more to it via his corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   The IPP grows to $1.5 million over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   Paul then adds his two children, Jason and Emma, as members of the IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   When Paul passes away, Jason and Emma take over the IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. They are not immediately taxed on the full balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Instead, they pay tax only as they withdraw funds, allowing them to control the tax impact and potentially keep themselves in lower tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

> [!success] Pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>
> *   **Defers taxation**: Unlike an RSP, where the entire balance is taxed upon death, the IPP spreads the tax liability over many years as the children make withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
> *   **Lower tax impact**: By withdrawing funds gradually, beneficiaries can keep themselves in lower tax brackets and reduce the total taxes owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
> *   **Tax-efficient wealth transfer**: The IPP is passed to the children without an immediate tax, preserving the full value of the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

> [!warning] Cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>
> *   **IPP management**: Beneficiaries will need to manage the IPP and ensure that withdrawals suit their income needs and corporate situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
> *   **Corporate involvement**: Children must be employed by the business and receive T4 income to participate in the IPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

The IPP is considered a very powerful tool for tax and estate planning for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Setting up an IPP is described as getting "exclusive VIP access to a retirement club" due to its higher benefits and tax perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Running Multiple RSP Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>

Combining multiple strategies can drastically reduce taxes both during your lifetime and when passing your estate to loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Common Blueprint Example: Jerry and Kim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
This example combines [[income_splitting_strategies_for_couples | income splitting]], gradual RSP withdrawals, and life insurance:
*   Jerry earns more than Kim, so he contributes to her spousal RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   When they retire, Kim withdraws from her RSP at a lower tax rate, saving them thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   Meanwhile, David (presumably Jerry, as Emma was mentioned earlier and not David) begins making gradual RSP withdrawals to spread out the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   To further protect their estate, they purchase life insurance to cover the taxes owed on David's RSP after he passes, ensuring their children inherit the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   David uses his gradual RSP withdrawals to cover those insurance premiums, reducing the tax hit further and effectively trading his RSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   This combined strategy smooths out their tax burden and maximizes the inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

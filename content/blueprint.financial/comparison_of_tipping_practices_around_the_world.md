Traveling offers insight into the diverse tipping cultures across the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. What might be expected in one country can be unusual or even offensive in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Historical European Roots
The ritual of tipping originated in the early 1900s, brought over from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It began as a master-servant custom in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Relaxed Tipping Cultures
Countries with cultural ties to Canada, such as Australia and the UK, often have a more relaxed approach to tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Australia** Tipping is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **United Kingdom** A service charge is frequently included, demonstrating that good service doesn't require a separate tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Asia's No-Tipping Norms
Generally, Asian countries do not expect tipping at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Japan** Tipping can even be viewed as rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Vietnam** A personal experience recounted how a server in Vietnam ran out to return a left tip, confirming that tipping is not customary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Observations on Service Quality
Service in cultures where tipping is not customary can be as good as, or even better than, service in countries like [[current_tipping_culture_and_trends_in_canada | Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This often results in interactions feeling more genuine and less transactional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## The Future: "Service Included" Models
The concept of "service included" pricing, similar to what is seen in Europe, where staff are paid higher wages and costs are included in menu prices, is gaining traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This provides a hassle-free experience and could be a direction for other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The [[impact_of_technology_on_tipping_behaviors | impact of technology on tipping behaviors]], particularly digital tipping screens, may also push more people towards these no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

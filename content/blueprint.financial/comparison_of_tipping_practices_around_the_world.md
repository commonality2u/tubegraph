Tipping customs vary significantly across the globe, offering a stark contrast to the [[current_tipping_practices_in_canada | current tipping practices in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Observing these different norms can highlight how service quality doesn't always correlate with the expectation of a tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

## Diverse Tipping Norms

While Canada's tipping culture has evolved significantly, becoming a significant expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>, many other countries maintain different approaches:

*   **Australia** Tipping is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **United Kingdom (UK)** A service charge is often included in the bill, indicating that good service does not require the additional burden of tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Countries like Australia and the UK, despite sharing cultural ties with Canada, adopt a much more relaxed stance on tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
*   **Asia** Generally, tipping is not expected at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. In some Asian countries, like Japan, tipping can even be considered rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. A personal anecdote from Vietnam illustrates this: a server once ran after a customer to return a tip, demonstrating that it is not customary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

In cultures where tipping is not customary or expected, service quality can be just as good, if not better, than in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. This often results in interactions that feel more genuine and less transactional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

## Impact on Service Experience

The speaker notes that experiencing different tipping cultures abroad highlighted how varying these norms are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. The shift in Canada from a polite gesture to a perceived "polite mugging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a> creates a different dynamic compared to regions where tips are not integral to service workers' income. In Canada, many workers rely on tips to make ends meet, contributing to the pressure felt by both customers and staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. In contrast, "no tipping models" or "service-included pricing," similar to European styles, are gaining traction in some Canadian establishments, where staff are paid higher wages and costs are included in menu prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. This approach aims to create a more hassle-free experience for the customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

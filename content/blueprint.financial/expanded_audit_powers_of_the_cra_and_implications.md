The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is intensifying its efforts to recover an estimated $20 billion in missing tax revenue annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This crackdown involves a significant [[increase_in_cra_audits_and_penalties | increase in audits]], harsher penalties, and a greater number of Canadians being flagged for scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. New technologies, particularly AI, are being leveraged to track down [[tax_fraud_and_consequences_in_canada | tax fraud]] and evasion by analyzing vast amounts of data to identify suspicious patterns and inconsistencies in tax filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The CRA's AI now drives audit selection, using advanced analytics to flag tax returns with unusual deductions, excessive claims, or inconsistent income reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Machine learning models also detect patterns from past fraudulent filings to identify new cases in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The agency is also cracking down on GST and HST return fraud, cross-checking claims against financial and corporate records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Furthermore, new data sharing agreements with banks and foreign financial institutions make it harder to hide unreported income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Proposed CRA Expanded Audit Powers

Proposed changes introduced in Budget 2024 aim to grant the CRA sweeping new audit powers, making tax enforcement more aggressive and potentially more invasive for taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These changes are designed to address a $20 billion tax gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, but raise concerns about fairness and due process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. If passed, routine audits could involve court orders, mandatory sworn statements, and financial penalties even before the audit is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Fines for Non-Compliance
If taxpayers do not fully cooperate with an audit request, the CRA can issue a Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC), resulting in a $50 per day fine, up to $25,000, until the issue is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The CRA can also pause the reassessment period, extending the time they can audit a taxpayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Questioning Under Oath
The CRA will gain the power to compel taxpayers to provide oral statements under oath or affirmation, a significant departure from current procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Unlike court testimony, this process may not include standard legal protections or formal transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Severe Compliance Penalties
Failure to comply with a court-issued order could lead to a 10% penalty on the total tax bill for the years in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Even withholding a single document can trigger this fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Indefinite Audit Deadlines
If a taxpayer challenges an NNC or fights a CRA demand in court, their reassessment period will not expire but will continue to be extended indefinitely until the case is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Implications for Taxpayers

These expanded powers mean that audits could become more aggressive, time-consuming, and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Even routine audits could become a legal and financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Taxpayers might face penalties before an audit even finishes, be forced to give statements under oath without standard legal protections, and spend more time and money responding to CRA requests, even for minor issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Who is at Risk?

The CRA's high-tech tools make it more effective at identifying [[risks_and_red_flags_for_being_audited_by_the_cra | tax fraud]], and certain taxpayers are more likely to be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:

*   **Excessive or Inconsistent Claims**: Taxpayers whose deductions seem too high compared to income, or whose reported earnings fluctuate drastically year-to-year without a clear reason, may be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The CRA's AI compares filings to similar taxpayers to spot anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Even small amounts of unreported income (e.g., $5,000) can lead to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Unwarranted GST/HST Refunds**: Individuals and businesses inflating expenses, underreporting sales, or falsely claiming tax rebates are under scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The CRA specifically targets businesses using shell companies or questionable bookkeeping to manipulate tax credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Real Estate and Cash-Based Businesses**: These industries are a focus due to concerns about unreported income, undeclared capital gains, and tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   **Real Estate Investors**: House flippers and landlords are under increased scrutiny, especially those misusing the principal residence exemption to avoid capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Landlords using platforms like Airbnb or VRBO who fail to report rental income correctly are also at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   **Cash-Based Businesses**: Restaurants, bars, construction companies, and auto repair shops are prime targets as they have a higher risk of underreporting sales or inflating expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. If reported earnings are suspiciously low compared to industry standards, an audit notice may be issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The Underused Housing Tax (UHT) is also a hot topic, with the CRA identifying homeowners who haven't properly reported or paid what they owe on vacant or underused properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Tax Planning and Evasion**: The CRA is taking a harder stance on complex tax strategies, especially those involving offshore accounts or sophisticated corporate structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Offshore Tax Evasion**: Canada collaborates with over 100 countries through the Common Reporting Standard, allowing financial institutions to share data with tax authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Undeclared foreign assets or income are more likely to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. High net worth individuals using offshore tax strategies are a major target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   **Corporate Tax Planning**: Businesses using strategies like income shifting, artificial losses, or questionable tax credits face tougher audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Tax shelters and setups designed to conceal income through trusts, numbered companies, and shell corporations are under intense scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The CRA is focusing on transactions that seem to exist purely for tax benefits rather than genuine business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

For those caught in [[tax_fraud_and_consequences_in_canada | tax evasion]], penalties are severe, including increased prosecution referrals, hefty fines, interest charges, criminal investigations, and even jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_protect_yourself_from_cra_audits | Strategies to Protect Yourself from Increased CRA Audits]]

To stay compliant and avoid trouble with the CRA's ramping up of audits and use of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>:

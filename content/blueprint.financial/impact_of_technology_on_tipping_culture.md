The introduction of new technologies, particularly digital payment options and tipping machines, has significantly reshaped [[current_tipping_practices_in_canada | tipping culture in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These advancements have made tipping more public and pressured, contributing to a phenomenon known as "tipflation" and altering [[public_opinion_on_tipping_culture | public opinion on tipping culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## The Rise of the Awkward Tipping Machine

Tipping machines are now ubiquitous, found in various establishments from coffee shops to food trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Their presence has made the act of tipping more uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. When completing a transaction, customers are often presented with a screen asking for a tip of 15%, 20%, or even 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Increased Pressure and Guilt

The visibility of the cashier while the customer makes a tip selection adds unnecessary pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Hitting "no tip" can feel like admitting one is cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. These machines frequently default to or push for higher tip percentages, transforming a personal choice into a public, guilt-driven moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Technology's Impact on Tipping Trends

Digital payment options have contributed to a rise in tipping in services that previously saw little to no tipping, such as coffee shops and fast food establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The average tip in Canada increased from 16% to 20% between 2019 and 2023, reflecting a growing pressure to tip across a broader range of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Tips to Navigate Tipping Machines

To manage the pressure exerted by tipping machines, consider these strategies:
*   **Carry Cash** Paying with cash bypasses the tipping machine entirely, eliminating the screen and the associated pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Be Quick with the Button** When using a tipping machine, make your choice swiftly to minimize the time spent on the screen and reduce perceived pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Set Your Tipping Rule** Decide on your intended tip amount before reaching the counter, preventing influence from the higher options displayed on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Remember It's Optional** Not all situations necessitate a tip. If the service does not warrant it, feel free to skip tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## The Future of Tipping and Technology

Digital tipping screens are making tipping more public and pressured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This technological push could prompt more consumers to advocate for no-tipping models or become more vocal in their dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The future of tipping in Canada will likely involve a mix of traditional tipping, increasingly aggressive tipping technology, and new no-tipping experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

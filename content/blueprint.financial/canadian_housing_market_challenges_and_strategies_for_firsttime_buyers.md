The [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | Canadian housing market]] presents significant challenges for first-time home buyers, with sky-high home prices, especially in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Saving a substantial down payment can seem impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, by strategically combining the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) with its Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), it is possible to achieve significant, tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a new tool specifically designed for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

*   **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, with a lifetime maximum contribution of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Tax Deductibility**: Contributions are tax deductible, similar to an RSP, providing tax breaks annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Spousal Savings**: If buying with a spouse or common-law partner, you can double the savings, potentially reaching a combined $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Contributions**: If someone else, like a spouse, contributes to your FHSA, the contribution is treated as if you made it, and the tax benefits (deductions and tax-free growth) apply to you, the FHSA holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The contributor has no tax obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: A key benefit is that qualifying withdrawals for a home purchase are entirely tax-free, with no repayment requirements like the RSP's Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### FHSA Growth Potential

The FHSA can significantly grow over time, building serious wealth for a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   If you contribute the maximum of $8,000 per year for 5 years, reaching the $40,000 lifetime limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, and assuming a 6% annual return, the account could grow to approximately $45,000 within those 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   If you leave the $45,000 in the FHSA for an additional 10 years at the same 6% rate, it could grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling the original contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This growth remains tax-free as long as it's used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) and Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

The RSP is a long-standing tool for [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement savings in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

*   **Contribution Limits**: You can contribute up to 18% of your income annually, with a maximum of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)**: The HBP allows you to withdraw up to $60,000 from your RSP tax-free to put towards your first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. For couples buying together, this doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Repayment Requirements**: Unlike the FHSA, HBP withdrawals must be repaid over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Missing a repayment adds that amount to your taxable income for the year, increasing your tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Combining FHSA and RSP/HBP for a Down Payment

Combining the FHSA and RSP (via HBP) allows first-time buyers to achieve significant down payment savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Example: Ross and Rachel

Consider Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   They each max out their FHSAs, contributing $40,000 each for a total of $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   They also use the HBP, each withdrawing $60,000 from their RSPs, for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   By combining the FHSA and HBP, Ross and Rachel achieve $200,000 for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Enhanced Potential with FHSA Growth

Factoring in the growth potential of the FHSA, the combined savings can be even greater:

*   If Ross and Rachel both contribute the maximum $8,000 per year to their FHSAs for 5 years, saving $80,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   With a 6% return over the next 10 years, their combined FHSA balance could grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Combined with $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals ($60,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, Ross and Rachel would have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Even without a partner, an individual can use this strategy to save up to $100,000 for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | Canadian Housing Market]] Reality Check

The [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | Canadian housing market]] has become a serious challenge for many first-time buyers due to skyrocketing prices, particularly in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, home prices have soared, making it difficult to save enough for a down payment and afford mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   Even in more affordable areas, rapid price increases are forcing buyers to come up with larger down payments to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

A $200,000 down payment, achievable by combining FHSA and RSP, can have varying impacts depending on the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:

*   **Affordable Cities**: In cities like Montreal and Calgary, where home prices are more affordable, $200,000 can cover about 32% of the total cost, giving buyers a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Higher-Priced Markets**: In Toronto and Vancouver, the same $200,000 only covers around 16% to 19%, meaning buyers need to take on much larger mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Using [[financial_planning_and_tax_advantages_for_home_ownership_in_canada | tax-free savings tools]] like the FHSA and HBP is crucial for buyers in expensive cities to offset large mortgage burdens, while in more affordable cities, a larger down payment can make market entry easier and secure more favorable mortgage terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Tax Advantages of FHSA and RSP

The tax advantages of accounts like the FHSA and RSP make a massive difference in the actual amount you need to save for a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

*   **Without Tax Benefits**: If you aim to save $200,000 without these tax-free accounts, you would need to account for taxes on your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. For example, with a 30% tax rate, you would need to earn over $285,000 just to have $200,000 left after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This means saving an additional $85,000 to reach your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **With FHSA and RSP**: Using these accounts, your contributions are tax deductible, meaning you don't pay taxes on that income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This allows you to save the full $200,000 without paying any taxes on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Every dollar contributed directly applies to your home purchase, drastically cutting down the overall savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

By thinking of the FHSA and RSP as puzzle pieces, individually they offer some help, but together they can complete the picture of home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Combining their tax-free benefits creates a clearer, faster path to owning a dream home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

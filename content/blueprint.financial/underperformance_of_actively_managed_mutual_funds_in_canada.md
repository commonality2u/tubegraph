[[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | Mutual funds]] are a significant investment vehicle in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This contrasts with $429 billion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating that mutual funds are still almost five times as popular as ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, despite their popularity, [[common_pitfalls_of_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] in Canada often come with several hidden downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

When discussing mutual funds, the focus is specifically on the [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high-cost, actively managed ones]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from many investors to acquire a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Professional portfolio managers or teams oversee these funds, making strategic decisions to buy and sell assets with the aim of outperforming a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian mutual funds often fail to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Reasons for Underperformance and Disadvantages

### High Fees

One of the primary reasons actively managed mutual funds in Canada are considered a poor investment is due to their [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These fees remain among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Average Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: According to Morningstar's 2022 report, the average asset-weighted MER for equity funds in Canada is approximately 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. For allocation funds, it's about 1.9%, and for fixed-income funds, it's 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Many equity funds from major banks like TD Bank show MERs over 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Impact of Fees**: A seemingly small 2% management fee can significantly reduce investment returns over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Example**: An initial investment of $100,000 growing at an average annual return of 7% would reach approximately $387,000 over 20 years without fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, with a 2% annual fee, the actual return becomes 5%, resulting in only $265,000 over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This represents a difference of $122,000, nearly one-third of potential returns lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Over 30 years, the difference becomes even more dramatic, with $329,000 or 43% of potential returns lost due to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Recent Trends**: Mutual fund fees in Canada have slightly decreased in recent years due to the introduction of fee-based advice and regulatory changes like client-focused reforms, which have promoted greater transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Low Returns

A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada consistently underperform their respective benchmarks across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   **Canadian Equity Funds**: Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark, the S&P/TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While the index gained an annualized return of 7.62%, Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This difference is nearly identical to the average 2% in fees charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Other Categories**:
    *   Canadian-focused Equity Funds: 98% underperformed their benchmark over the same 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds: 88.6% fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Canadian Small to Mid-Cap Equity Funds: 76.19% underperformed their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Consistency**: Even over shorter periods like three and five years, the majority of these funds continue to lag behind their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This consistent underperformance highlights a systemic issue within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Tricky Marketing Tactics and Survivorship Bias

Banks and financial institutions often employ marketing strategies that can obscure the true performance of mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. They tend to highlight only the top-performing funds, creating an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **Selective Reporting**: This selective reporting ignores the underperforming funds that were closed or merged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Advertisements featuring impressive returns from "HP performers" conveniently omit the many other funds that underperformed and were quietly shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **[[survivorship_bias_and_its_impact_on_mutual_fund_performance | Survivorship Bias]]**: This phenomenon occurs when only surviving funds are considered in performance reports, while poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This creates a misleadingly positive picture of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   **Statistics**: Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. On average across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Specifically, only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived, and for Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Tax Inefficiency Concerns

[[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds_and_alternatives | Tax inefficiency]] is another significant concern, particularly when mutual funds are held in a non-registered taxable account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Capital Gains Distribution**: Mutual funds are required to distribute any realized capital gains to their investors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This means investors can incur taxes on gains even if they haven't sold any shares themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed mutual funds often engage in frequent trading, leading to numerous short-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. These short-term gains are typically taxed at a higher rate (your regular income tax rate) than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing**: Investors have no control over when fund managers realize gains or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This can lead to taxable events at inconvenient times, increasing tax liability, and potentially disrupting long-term investment plans designed for lower tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Alternative**: To avoid these tax inefficiencies, investing in a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) is a viable option, as investments within a TFSA are not subject to these tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is an example of [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax-efficient investment strategies in Canada]].

### Aggressive Distribution Channels

Despite their drawbacks, mutual funds remain popular due to their accessibility and the aggressive distribution strategies employed by financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

*   **Convenience and Accessibility**: Mutual funds offer a straightforward way to diversify investments across various asset classes without requiring extensive market knowledge or large amounts of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Bank Influence**: Banks and financial advisors actively promote mutual funds due to aggressive sales targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. As a high-profit product for banks, they are incentivized to push these products onto customers opening accounts or seeking other services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Appeal of Professional Management**: Many investors are drawn to mutual funds because they are managed by professional portfolio managers, who are perceived as experts capable of making informed investment decisions and achieving high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This belief persists despite data often showing otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Misleading Marketing**: Marketing tools like Morningstar's five-star ratings can mislead investors into believing they will achieve better performance, even though studies have shown that these "five-star" funds tend to underperform in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Alternatives to Mutual Funds

Several viable alternatives to mutual funds in Canada offer potentially lower fees and better returns:

*   **Robo-Advisors**: These platforms provide convenient and cost-effective investment management, typically charging lower fees (around half of mutual fund fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Examples include Questwealth and Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Hiring a Portfolio Manager**: Engaging a professional portfolio manager can be more cost-effective than investing in mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. They create personalized investment strategies tailored to individual financial goals and risk tolerance, offering expertise at potentially lower fees than mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Building Your Own ETF Portfolios**: The trend is shifting towards [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | ETFs over mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. In May 2024, mutual funds experienced net redemptions of $1.8 billion, while ETFs saw net sales of $4.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Building an ETF portfolio can offer greater flexibility, lower fees, and better tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This approach is also relevant to [[investment_strategies_using_dividend_etfs_in_canada | investment strategies using dividend ETFs in Canada]] and understanding the [[features_and_performance_of_top_canadian_dividend_etfs | features and performance of top Canadian dividend ETFs]].
*   **Do-It-Yourself Stock Portfolio**: For those willing to dedicate significant time, research, and effort, creating a direct stock portfolio offers the most control over investments, minimal fees, and complete customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

While mutual funds are a popular choice in Canada, their [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] and consistent underperformance can significantly impact future returns and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Considering alternatives like robo-advisors, portfolio managers, or building an ETF portfolio can lead to more cost-effective and efficient investment outcomes.

The average Chinese household saves between 36% and over 40% of their income, meaning at least $36 is saved for every $100 earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Canada's savings rate of 6.9% and the U.S. rate of just 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This significant difference highlights the powerful [[chinese_savings_habits | cultural influences on saving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

The speaker, ethnically Chinese, grew up in Canada where saving money was a core value in their household, representing a [[financial_and_savings_habits_of_chinese_canadians | cultural clash]] between high-saving and low-saving cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The following sections explore key habits and mindsets that contribute to high saving rates in Chinese culture.

## Turning Deals into a Hobby

For many first-generation Asian parents living in Canada or the U.S., getting a good deal, especially at places like Costco, is a passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. It's not merely about buying in bulk but about the thrill of saving money on every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Saving money and finding deals is often treated as a competitive sport among siblings and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

This habit is rooted in the experiences of many who came from places where money was tight, and even a small saving could make a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Finding a good deal is seen as a honed survival skill and a source of pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For second-generation individuals growing up in Canada, this can create a cultural clash between wanting to spend without guilt and parents laser-focused on value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This cultural approach can be seen as a [[strategies_for_saving_on_groceries | strategy for saving on groceries]] and other everyday expenses.

## Focus on High-Earning Careers

In Chinese culture, particularly among immigrant families, money and prestige are seen as symbols of security, respect, and a chance to transform a family's future within a single generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Many Chinese immigrants start from scratch, working relentlessly to secure a better life for their children, making financial success essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Becoming a doctor, for example, is often viewed as the fastest way to elevate a family from struggling immigrants to respected professionals, providing instant credibility, respectability, and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This intense focus, however, can also pressure children into careers they are not passionate about, leading to stress and unfulfilled lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While this drive leads to significant achievements, it also highlights the challenge of balancing personal happiness with the pursuit of status and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Developing a [[scarcity_mindset_and_saving | Scarcity Mindset]]

A [[scarcity_mindset_and_saving | scarcity mindset]] is common among many Chinese people, especially immigrants, stemming from experiences of growing up with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This belief that there's "never enough" (money, opportunities, security) makes individuals hyper-aware of spending, always hunting for deals, and planning for the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. It influences all aspects of life, leading to cautious financial habits and a deep appreciation for what one has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

However, this mindset has downsides: even when financially secure, the fear of not having enough can lead to reluctance to take risks or enjoy earned wealth, causing constant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The key is to find a balance, being cautious and grateful while allowing room for growth and optimism, recognizing when financial stability is achieved, and shifting focus toward enjoying life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Strong [[cultural_aversion_to_debt | Distaste for Debt]]

Money is viewed very differently in North America compared to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. In North America, debt is often seen as a necessary part of achieving a certain standard of living, used to finance everything from houses to everyday purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In China, there is a strong [[cultural_aversion_to_debt | aversion to debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Borrowing money is often considered risky or irresponsible, with individuals taught from a young age to spend only what they have earned and saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

This approach stems from a history of economic uncertainty, emphasizing financial stability and self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Being debt-free is a source of pride, reflecting control over finances and a stable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This contrasts sharply with North America, where debt is often seen as a tool for building wealth, highlighting different cultural values around money and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Zero-Based Budgeting

The concept of a zero-based budgeting system aligns well with traditional Chinese values of careful financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This method involves planning every cent of income so that by the end of the month, every amount is accounted for, leaving a zero balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Every part of income is assigned a purpose, whether for bills, savings, or daily expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The goal is to be intentional with money, ensuring nothing is unplanned or wasted, and maximizing the use of every penny while avoiding unnecessary expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This method encourages discipline and careful planning, both highly valued in Chinese culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Hating Waste

A strong aversion to waste is prevalent in Chinese culture, extending to food, money, and even plastic bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Growing up, children are often taught to finish their plate and use leftovers for the next day's lunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This isn't just about frugality but about respect, acknowledging the hard work that went into acquiring possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Old clothes might be repurposed for household wear, and takeout containers are washed and reused for meal prep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. While this mindset teaches appreciation and resourcefulness, and is good for the environment, it can also be tiring, leading to guilt over simple desires like tossing out unwanted food or buying a new shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Prioritizing Home-Cooked Meals

Eating at home is central to Chinese culture, simultaneously saving money and bringing the family together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Cooking meals at home ensures fresh, healthy food prepared to personal preference, often at a much lower cost than eating out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Meal planning and home cooking are second nature in Chinese households, allowing for the enjoyment of traditional dishes that might be expensive or difficult to find in restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Leftovers are also frequently used for subsequent meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While Chinese households do eat out, it's typically reserved for special occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## The Dark Side of Saving Too Much

While saving is crucial for financial stability, excessive saving can become a burden when driven by fear and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. In China, many save excessively due to fear of unexpected expenses, job loss, or pressure to keep up with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This "survival instinct on overdrive" often leads to sacrificing present enjoyment for future security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

There is also significant cultural pressure, especially from family, to save for major expenses like weddings, homes, or caring for aging parents, creating constant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:03]</a>. Excessive saving can even harm the economy by reducing money in circulation, slowing down business activity, and potentially leading to deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:18]</a>. A lack of trust in social safety nets like pensions or healthcare also drives many to save out of necessity or fear, leading to ongoing anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

Ultimately, while savings are important for [[significance_of_a_high_savings_rate_in_wealth_accumulation | wealth accumulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> and achieving [[key_ingredients_for_growing_retirement_savings | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, when driven by fear or pressure, it can cause significant stress and economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Finding a balance between saving for the future and enjoying life now is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, addressing the "[[save_or_spend_dilemma_in_retirement | save or spend dilemma]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

The [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living crisis]] is a significant concern for many Canadians.
According to the 2025 food price report:
> [45% of Canadians are struggling with day-to-day costs, with food being a major part of the struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

> Budgeting has shifted from getting ahead to surviving for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### Impact on Different Demographics
Younger Canadians, particularly nearly half of [[Gen Z]], have resorted to dipping into savings or borrowing money just to afford food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Even middle-income households are feeling the financial pinch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. This struggle highlights that expenses are outpacing incomes, even with careful financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

## Adapting Shopping and Eating Habits

### Strategic Shopping
Consumers are increasingly adopting strategies to manage rising grocery bills:
*   **Bulk buying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>
*   **Comparing flyers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>
*   **Cutting impulse spending** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>
*   **Hunting for discounts**: 48% of Canadians are actively seeking discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Shifting away from brand loyalty**: Affordability is becoming the primary emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   **Visiting smaller stores and farmers markets**: Shoppers are moving away from major chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

### Dietary Changes
[[impact_of_inflation_on_food_prices_in_canada | Food inflation]] is directly influencing what Canadians eat:
*   **Reducing overall food intake**: Over 28% of Canadians are simply eating less to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
*   **Substituting expensive items**: With beef prices rising (9.2% in 2024), consumers are swapping steak for chicken, pork, or lentils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Cooking more creatively and reducing waste** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

### Utilizing Resources
Some consumers are leveraging online tools for meal planning and budgeting. A recommended free site, budgetbytes.com, offers recipes with detailed cost breakdowns per serving, helping users plan meals and save money on groceries while maintaining a healthy diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. While prices are in US dollars, an estimated 30% addition can convert them to Canadian costs, still making meals affordable compared to takeout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Public Frustration and Calls for Change
The widespread frustration led to a boycott of Loblaws in 2024, a major grocery chain, due to concerns over [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | rising prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. Although the boycott did not significantly impact the system, it became a symbol of consumer powerlessness and a demand for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. Despite consumers shifting habits, large grocery chains retain significant power, leading to continued public frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.

The year 2025 brings several tax changes in Canada designed to help individuals maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Key updates include adjustments to investment and real estate, household taxes, pensions, and business owner taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Investment and Real Estate Changes

### Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)
In 2025, the RRSP contribution limit has seen an increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

*   **Contribution Limit:** The annual RRSP contribution limit for 2025 is $32,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This is an increase from $31,560 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Contribution Calculation:** The limit allows individuals to contribute up to 18% of their earned income, capped at this new maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   **Impact on Earners:** Those earning $180,500 or more will reach the maximum contribution limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For anyone earning below this amount, their maximum contributions will be 18% of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
A significant change has been made to the Home Buyers' Plan, which is related to RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

*   **Withdrawal Limit Increase:** The HBP withdrawal limit has increased from $35,000 to $60,000 per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, or $120,000 per couple, for an RRSP down payment withdrawal towards a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Repayment Grace Period:** The repayment grace period has been extended from 2 years to 5 years for withdrawals, providing buyers with more time before starting RRSP repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Alex and Jamie, as first-time home buyers, can each withdraw $60,000 from their RRSPs for a combined $120,000 down payment. With the extended 5-year grace period for repayment, they have more time to manage their finances before repayments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)
The TFSA remains a key account for tax savings, with its limits consistent with the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

*   **Annual Contribution Limit:** In 2025, the annual TFSA contribution limit remains at $7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, which is the same as the 2024 limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Cumulative Limit:** For individuals who have qualified since the TFSA's inception in 2009, the total cumulative limit is $92,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Unused Room:** Any unused contribution room carries forward indefinitely, allowing individuals to catch up in future years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

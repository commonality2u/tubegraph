Did you know that your TFSA can be penalized and taxed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> To keep your TFSA truly tax-free, it's crucial to avoid three specific red flags that can put you on the CRA's bad side. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>

## Turning Your TFSA into a Business

One major [[mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investing | mistake to avoid in TFSA investing]] is transforming your TFSA into what the CRA considers a business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

### The Case of Fared Ahamed
Fared Ahamed, an investment advisor, started his TFSA in 2009 with $15,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> Within three years, he grew it to $617,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> However, this dream turned into a nightmare when the CRA intervened. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> Ahamed wasn't just buying and holding stocks; he was engaged in high-volume trading, primarily with penny stocks, often flipping them within hours or days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

The CRA determined that the nature and frequency of his trades indicated he was no longer just investing, but running a business within his TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> As a result, his $617,000 was reclassified as taxable business income, leading to hefty tax bills and potential penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

### Why the CRA Cares About Day Trading
Day trading involves quick buys and sells to profit from small price changes, a fast and risky approach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> The CRA doesn't view this as the intended activity for a TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> If your trading patterns resemble those of a professional trader—marked by short holding periods, expert strategies, or the use of borrowed funds—the CRA may deem it a business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> If your TFSA is considered a business, every dollar you earn becomes taxable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

### How to Stay on the CRA's Good Side
The CRA doesn't provide a specific rule book on what constitutes excessive trading. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> It's evaluated on a case-by-case basis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> The key is to keep your TFSA appearing as a long-term investing and savings vehicle, not a trading desk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a> Stick to investments you plan to hold for a while, such as ETFs, blue-chip stocks, or bonds, and avoid frequent stock flipping or using leverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> This helps in [[avoiding_tfsa_investment_pitfalls | avoiding TFSA investment pitfalls]].

## Overcontribution to Your TFSA

[[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_mistakes | Avoiding TFSA overcontribution mistakes]] is critical, as it can lead to significant penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

### An Egregious Example
In 2020, one taxpayer drastically overcontributed by $639,950 to their TFSA, using borrowed funds from a line of credit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> Under the Income Tax Act, any overcontribution to a TFSA incurs a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> For this individual, this meant a penalty of approximately $6,393 per month, not including additional interest and penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>

Despite claiming ignorance of the rules and blaming their financial institution, the taxpayer refused to withdraw the excess funds immediately, hoping for market recovery. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> The Federal Court ruled against them, stating the overcontribution was not a reasonable error and their delay in removing funds violated rules for prompt correction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a> This case underscores the importance of knowing TFSA rules and acting quickly if an error occurs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>

### Non-Resident Contributions
Overcontributions can also occur when a Canadian resident moves abroad but continues to contribute to their TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> Non-residents are not permitted to contribute to a TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> For example, Jessica moved to the US and contributed $6,000 to her TFSA, resulting in a 1% monthly penalty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> Because she was not in Canada, this mistake went unnoticed for several years, leading to thousands of dollars in [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | CRA penalties on TFSA investments]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

### Common Overcontribution Gotchas
*   **Trusting CRA's Online Contribution Limits:** The CRA's online records may not always be up to date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a> It's crucial to keep your own meticulous records to avoid accidental overcontributions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>
*   **Re-contributing in the Same Year:** Withdrawing funds from your TFSA does not immediately restore your contribution room. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> That room resets on January 1 of the following calendar year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> Re-contributing in the same year will lead to penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>
*   **Not Transferring Investments In Kind:** When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the cash into your TFSA can cause overcontribution issues. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> Instead, transfer investments "in kind" (without selling) to avoid these problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>

## Prohibited Investments in a TFSA

Your TFSA has clear restrictions on what you can invest in. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> [[prohibited_investments_in_tfsa | Prohibited investments in TFSA]] can trigger severe penalties.

### What are Prohibited Investments?
These generally include:
*   **Significant Interest Holdings:** Owning 10% or more of a private company's shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>
*   **Non-Arm's Length Relationships:** Investments in businesses where you or your family members have significant control or influence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>

The CRA's goal is to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures, ensuring they remain tools for legitimate, arm's length investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>

### Penalties for Prohibited Investments
The penalties for holding prohibited investments are substantial:
*   **50% Special Tax:** If your TFSA acquires a prohibited investment, you face a tax equal to 50% of the investment's fair market value at the time of acquisition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains:** Any income or capital gains generated from prohibited investments are taxed at 100%, effectively nullifying any tax benefit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>

For instance, if you invest $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative, and it grows to $50,000, the CRA could deem it a prohibited investment due to the close connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> This would result in a $25,000 tax (50% of $50,000), and the shares must be removed from your TFSA, meaning future gains are no longer tax-free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>

### How to Stay Safe
To avoid these severe penalties, consult the CRA's guidelines for qualified investments. Ensure that your [[investment_strategies_for_tfsa | Investment Strategies for TFSA]] only include items explicitly allowed by the CRA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>

Your TFSA is a powerful wealth-building tool, but only if used wisely and by [[avoiding_tfsa_investment_pitfalls | avoiding these red flags]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

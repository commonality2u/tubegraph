A single person earning $30,000 in Canada is considered to be in the high-income group worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This income translates to approximately $56 per day in purchasing power parity dollars, which is significantly higher than what most of the global population earns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

While individuals often compare their financial situations to friends, colleagues, or social media influencers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, a global view reveals stark contrasts. Many people worldwide live on just a few dollars a day and have limited access to basic essentials like clean water and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Experiencing extreme poverty firsthand can foster gratitude for one's own circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

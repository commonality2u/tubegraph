Starting to invest can be confusing due to conflicting advice, but a five-step framework can help anyone. The first step in this framework is to develop your investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Importance of "Your Why"

Developing your investment philosophy begins with understanding "the why" behind your desire to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is considered the most crucial step in your investment journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Many people dive into investing simply because they feel they should, but investing without a clear purpose is compared to setting sail without a destination or compass, leading to aimless drifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

It is essential to have a clear purpose. Common reasons for investing include:
*   Saving for a down payment on a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Retiring comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Achieving financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   Funding your education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Providing for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>

The more specific and personal your reasons, the stronger your foundation will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The speaker's personal purpose for investing is about freedom, the freedom to live life on their own terms, and the confidence that comes with financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Having financial security has allowed them to take calculated risks and provides the clarity and motivation to stay consistent with their [[key_investment_strategies_and_options | strategy]], even when delaying gratification is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Knowing your "why" makes it easier to stick to your plan, weather market ups and downs, and make decisions aligned with your long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Taking a moment to reflect and gain clarity on your purpose is key to building a [[key_investment_strategies_and_options | strategy]] that endures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Related Aspects of Investment Philosophy

While "the why" is central, other elements indirectly contribute to shaping your philosophy:

### Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
When [[choosing_investments_and_managing_risk | choosing investments]], understanding your [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation_based_on_risk_tolerance | risk tolerance]] and time horizon is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This assessment helps determine how comfortable you are with potential portfolio dips during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Your time horizon—how long you plan to stay invested—also plays a major role, as longer timelines typically allow for higher-risk investments due to more time to recover from market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Professional Guidance
When considering hiring a portfolio manager, ensure their approach aligns with your established investment philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It's important to find someone unbiased who is focused on helping you grow your money rather than just selling products for high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

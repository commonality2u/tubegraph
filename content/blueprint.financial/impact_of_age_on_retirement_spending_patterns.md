Understanding how spending evolves with age is crucial for [[financial_planning_for_retirement | planning for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Retirees often wonder what their monthly expenditures will look like, and spending patterns do change significantly across different life stages and even within the retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:19">[06:52:19]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees (65+)

For Canadian retirees aged 65 and over, the average household expenditure is $61,800 annually, or $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

Key categories of spending include:
*   **Shelter**: The largest portion, averaging $1,151 per month (22.3% of monthly spending), even for homeowners, due to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Food**: Approximately $639 per month (12.4% of monthly spending), covering groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: While generally lower for retirees, it still accounts for 8.8% of the monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Despite free healthcare in Canada, medical needs increase with age, allocating 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**: Take up 5.4% of monthly spending, highlighting the need for continued [[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | financial security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**: Account for 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## How Costs Change Throughout Life

Household spending patterns evolve significantly as individuals progress through different phases of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. Data from Statistics Canada illustrates these shifts:

### Middle-Aged Households (40-54)
This period sees the highest spending, averaging $82,646 annually or $6,887 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This peak is driven by:
*   Higher family needs, including larger homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
*   Increased food consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   Education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   Rising healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   A strong focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Pre-Retirement Households (55-64)
Spending begins to decrease slightly, averaging about $99,250 annually (this number was misspoken in the transcript, likely meant to be lower than previous range and was then correctly stated as $8,230 monthly) or $8,230 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Key changes include:
*   A drop in childcare expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   Continued significant rise in healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   Increased focus on paying off mortgages and preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

### Retired Households (65+)
Spending reduces further to $61,800 annually, or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs, such as:
*   Housing maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   Food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   Healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   Less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## [[stages_of_retirement_and_changing_expenses | Stages of Retirement]] Spending

Within retirement itself, spending typically follows three distinct phases: high, medium, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

### Early Retirement (Ages 65-70) - High Spending
In these initial years, retirees often have more energy and desire to engage in activities they couldn't during their working lives. For example, Alex, a Canadian retiree, spends about $70,000 annually or $5,833 monthly during this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   Housing costs are still high due to maintenance and property taxes, even with the mortgage paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   Transportation costs decrease due to no daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   Food spending slightly decreases, as dining out is less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   Spending on hobbies and travel is common, taking advantage of new free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Mid-Retirement (Ages 70-75) - Medium Spending
As retirees age, spending tends to decrease. Alex's annual spending drops to around $60,000, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.
*   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
*   Transportation costs reduce further due to less travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   Food costs remain stable or decrease as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   Spending on travel reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Later Retirement (After Age 75) - Low Spending
In later years, activity levels often decline, leading to further reduced spending. Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000, or around $4,160 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   Transportation costs are significantly lower due to rare travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   Healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   Travel spending generally ceases, with focus shifting to community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

## Real-Life Client Observations

Financial advisors observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients, typically between $4,000 and $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. High-end households might spend $5,000 to $9,000 per month or even upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

A common trend is that spending starts higher in the early years of retirement and gradually decreases, much like the example of Alex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. There's typically about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. For instance, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

This reduction is attributed to factors such as:
*   Lower housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   Reduced transportation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   Overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.
*   Declining spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Understanding these trends helps in [[financial_planning_for_retirement | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] by anticipating changes in spending habits, ensuring enough savings to cover needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

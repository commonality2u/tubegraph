While the FHSA is often the preferred account for home savings, there are two key situations where the [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] still comes out on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Investing in US Stocks

When investing in US Stocks, the [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] offers a significant advantage over the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **FHSA:** Any dividends earned from US Stocks within an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **RRSP:** Thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, this 15% withholding tax is avoided when investing in US Stocks through an [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> **Pro Tip:** Invest in US Stocks through your [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]], not your FHSA, to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Employer Matching Contributions

Another clear advantage of the [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] is the availability of employer matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

*   If an employer offers to match [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] contributions, this is essentially "free money" that boosts retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   For example, if an employer matches up to $5,000 per year, a $5,000 contribution by an employee would result in an additional $5,000 from the employer, totaling $10,000 in the [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This is a significant benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Therefore, if an individual has access to employer matching benefits at work, the [[importance_of_employer_matching_for_rrsp | RRSP]] is the clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

In summary, the [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] takes the lead for long-term investors and those with strong work benefits, particularly for avoiding US dividend taxes and taking advantage of employer matching benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The only times it makes more sense to prioritize an [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] over an FHSA are if you are heavily investing in US dividend stocks or receiving employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

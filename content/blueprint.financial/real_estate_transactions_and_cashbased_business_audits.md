The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is increasing its audit activities, with a particular focus on real estate and cash-heavy businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. These industries have historically been scrutinized due to concerns about unreported income, undeclared capital gains, and tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. With enhanced data tracking and increased funding for enforcement, the CRA is now examining these sectors more closely than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Who's at Risk?

### Real Estate Sector
*   **Real Estate Investors, House Flippers, and Landlords** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>: These groups face increased scrutiny, especially if they are misusing the principal residence exemption to avoid capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. If multiple properties have been sold in recent years, the CRA may question whether the taxpayer is truly a homeowner or engaged in house flipping under the radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Landlords using rental platforms**: Individuals renting properties through platforms like Airbnb or VRBO are at risk if they fail to report rental income accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Cash-Based Businesses
*   **Prime Targets**: Businesses that deal mostly in cash, such as restaurants, bars, construction companies, and auto repair shops, are a major focus for the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Underreporting and Inflating Expenses**: The CRA recognizes that cash-heavy businesses have a higher risk of underreporting sales or inflating expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. If a business's financial records do not reconcile, an audit is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Areas of Focus

*   **Undeclared Capital Gains and Rental Income**: Real estate transactions are receiving particular attention regarding undeclared capital gains and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Underused Housing Tax (UHT)**: Homeowners with vacant or underused properties may be unknowingly breaking tax rules, and the CRA is actively identifying those who have not properly reported or paid what they owe under the UHT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Cash Transactions**: For business owners, the CRA is adopting a stricter stance on cash transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. If reported earnings appear suspiciously low compared to industry standards, an audit notice may be issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The era of "cash under the table" going unnoticed is rapidly ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

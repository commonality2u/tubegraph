In Canada's housing market, combining the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) through its Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) can significantly help in saving for a down payment, potentially up to $200,000 tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy helps maximize savings and achieve homeownership sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a new tool specifically designed for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Contribution Rules
*   You can contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   There is a lifetime maximum contribution of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Contributions are tax deductible, similar to an [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]], providing a tax break annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Spousal and Common-Law Benefits
If buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, you can combine your FHSAs to save a total of $80,000 tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[using_fhsa_for_income_splitting | Using FHSA for income splitting]]
> If a higher-income spouse contributes to your FHSA, the contribution is treated as if you made it. This means the [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax benefits of FHSA versus RRSP]], such as deductions and tax-free growth, apply to the FHSA holder, not the contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The person contributing has no tax obligation related to that contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Tax-Free Withdrawals
A key benefit of the FHSA is that qualifying withdrawals for a home purchase are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Unlike the RRSP's Home Buyers' Plan, there are no repayment headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Growth Potential of the FHSA
The FHSA can grow significantly over time. If you contribute the maximum of $8,000 per year for 5 years, reaching the $40,000 lifetime limit, and assuming a 6% annual return, your account could grow to about $45,000 by the end of those 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If this $45,000 is left in the FHSA for another 10 years at the same 6% rate of return, it could grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling your original contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This growth remains entirely tax-free as long as it's used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

The RRSP is a traditional account for [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | retirement savings using FHSA and RRSP]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Contribution Rules
*   You can contribute up to 18% of your income annually, with a maximum of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
The HBP allows you to withdraw up to $60,000 tax-free from your RRSP to put towards your first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For couples buying together, this doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Repayment Obligation
Unlike the FHSA, you must repay the HBP withdrawal over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. If a repayment is missed, that amount is added to your taxable income for the year, increasing your tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Combining FHSA and HBP for a Down Payment

By strategically using both the FHSA and the RRSP's HBP, first-time home buyers can significantly boost their down payment savings.

### Example: Ross and Rachel
Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home, maximized their savings through these accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>:
*   **FHSA**: They each contributed the maximum $40,000 to their FHSAs, totaling $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **RRSP HBP**: They each withdrew $60,000 from their RRSPs via the HBP, for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Total Down Payment**: By combining both, Ross and Rachel accumulated $200,000 for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

This strategy allows them to enter the housing market sooner with less financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Even without a partner, an individual can save up to $100,000 by combining these accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Enhanced Example with FHSA Growth
Considering the growth potential of the FHSA:
*   Ross and Rachel each contribute the maximum $8,000 per year to their FHSAs for 5 years, reaching a combined $80,000 in contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   With a 6% return over the next 10 years (after contributions cease), their combined FHSA balance would grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Adding their $120,000 combined HBP withdrawals from their RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, Ross and Rachel would have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Canadian Housing Market Reality Check

The Canadian housing market presents significant challenges for first-time buyers, with skyrocketing prices, especially in major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, home prices have made it difficult to save for a down payment and afford mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Even in more affordable areas, rapid price increases necessitate larger down payments to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Impact of Combined Savings by Region
A $200,000 down payment, achievable by combining FHSA and RRSP/HBP, has varying impacts depending on the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>:
*   In cities like Montreal and Calgary, $200,000 can cover about 32% of the total home cost, providing a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   In higher-priced markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, the same $200,000 might only cover 16% to 19% of the cost, meaning buyers will need much larger mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

This highlights the crucial role of tax-free savings tools like the FHSA and the HBP; every bit of savings helps offset mortgage burdens in expensive cities and makes market entry easier in more affordable areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Real estate agents are excited about the FHSA and the increased $60,000 HBP limit, as understanding how to combine these accounts makes home ownership achievable much faster for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Tax Advantages of Combined Accounts

When saving for a large down payment, the tax advantages of accounts like the FHSA and RRSP are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **Without Tax Benefits**: If you aim to save $200,000 without these tax-free accounts, you must consider taxes on your income. For example, with a 30% tax rate, you would need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 left after taxes, an additional $85,000 just to reach your goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **With FHSA and RRSP**: Contributions to these accounts are tax deductible, meaning you don't pay taxes on that income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This allows you to save the full $200,000 without paying a penny in taxes on it, drastically cutting down the overall amount you need to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

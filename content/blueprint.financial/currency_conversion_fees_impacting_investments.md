Currency conversion fees, also known as FX fees, can significantly impact investment returns, especially for Canadians investing in US stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42">[02:42]</a>. Many investors lose money without realizing it due to these fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49">[02:49]</a>.

## What are FX Fees?

FX fees are charges applied every time Canadian Dollars (CAD) are converted to US Dollars (USD) or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55">[02:55]</a>. Most brokerage firms typically charge an FX fee of between 1.5% to 2.5% per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>. These fees can quickly accumulate, eroding [[impact_of_trading_fees_on_investment_returns | investment returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>.

## Impact on Investments

Consider an example where you invest in Apple stock, requiring a conversion of $50,000 CAD into USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>. If your broker charges a 2% FX fee, you immediately lose $1,000, leaving only $49,000 available for share purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14">[03:14]</a>. If you later sell the investment and convert the proceeds back to CAD, another 2% FX fee would apply, costing another $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[03:25]</a>. Even with a profitable investment, you could lose $2,000 solely due to currency conversion fees, not including other [[impact_of_trading_fees_on_investment_returns | trading costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33">[03:33]</a>.

Frequent trading of US stocks or regular portfolio rebalancing can lead to tens of thousands of dollars in hidden fees over an investor's lifetime, money that could have been compounding within investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>.

## How to Avoid or Minimize FX Fees

Several strategies can help reduce or avoid currency conversion fees:

*   **Utilize Discount Brokerages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>: Some discount brokerages offer much lower FX fees. Interactive Brokers is noted for having some of the lowest fees in Canada, although it may not be the most user-friendly platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.
*   **Norbert's Gambit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04">[04:04]</a>: This tactic involves buying an interlisted stock (a stock listed on both Canadian and US exchanges), journaling it to the other currency, and then selling it to largely avoid FX fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05">[04:05]</a>. It is a more complex method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13">[04:13]</a>.
*   **Maintain a US Dollar Brokerage Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>: Keeping a US dollar account allows investors to trade US stocks without repeatedly converting CAD to USD, thereby avoiding recurrent fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19">[04:19]</a>.

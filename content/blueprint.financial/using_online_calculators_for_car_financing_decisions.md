When considering a car purchase, it's common to wonder whether to buy, lease, or finance a vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While there isn't a single answer for everyone, online calculators can help guide this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. These tools can walk you through the options, breaking down the pros and cons of each choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Recommended Online Calculator

One highly recommended online calculator for this purpose is found at Bankrate.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This tool is user-friendly and can be used for any car, regardless of whether you are in America or [[options_for_acquiring_a_new_car_in_canada | Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## How to Use a Car Financing Calculator

To use the calculator, you'll need to input specific numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The most accurate way to get these numbers is to visit a dealership and obtain quotes for both financing and leasing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If that's not possible, you can often find information on the car company's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### General Inputs

For an example using a Ford F-150, which is a popular vehicle in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   **Vehicle Price**: For instance, $49,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Down Payment**: This can be set to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Tax Rate**: Use the rate applicable to your region, e.g., 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Investment Rate of Return**: This represents the return you could earn if you invested your money elsewhere, serving as an opportunity cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A higher rate makes buying less appealing compared to leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   *Conservative investor*: 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
    *   *Middle of the road*: 5-6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    *   *Aggressive portfolio*: 7% and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
    *   *Example input*: 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>

### Buy Option Inputs

When entering details for the buy option:
*   **Term**: For example, 48 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate (APR)**: For example, 1.99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It's important to verify if you qualify for low rates at the dealership, as they might not always be available depending on your credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Fees**: For instance, $2,495 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Annual Depreciation Rate**: This is considered the most critical number for the calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For the example, 15% annual depreciation over 48 months was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Lease Option Inputs

When entering details for the lease option:
*   **Term**: For example, 48 months, to ensure an "apples to apples" comparison with the buy option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Annual Mileage**: Choose your estimated annual usage, such as 20,000 or 25,000 kilometers/miles per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: For instance, 4.49% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Fees**: For example, $2,495 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Residual Percent**: This is the car's expected value at the end of the lease term, usually between 40% and 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This non-negotiable number is provided by the dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For the example, 50% was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Understanding Car Depreciation and its Impact on Buying Decisions

[[understanding_car_depreciation_and_its_impact_on_buying_decisions | Car depreciation]] is a crucial factor that significantly influences whether you should lease or buy a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. It represents the "massive chunks of value" that a new car loses, especially in its first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Methods to Estimate Car Depreciation

There are several ways to estimate how much a car will depreciate each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>:

1.  **Research Average Depreciation Rates**: New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year, and then 15% each year for the subsequent four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This method is often used for examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
2.  **Use Online Depreciation Estimators**: Websites like Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book offer free tools to estimate a car's depreciation based on its make, model, year, and mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
3.  **Check Current Marketplaces**: This method provides real-time insight into a car's current value and how much it has depreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. You can use sites such as AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji to check current listings for your car's make, model, and year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This method is favored because it shows actual listed and sold prices, not just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Interpreting Calculator Results and Key Variables

After plugging in all the numbers, the calculator will show the net cost of buying versus leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. For instance, with the example numbers provided (5% investment return, 15% depreciation), the net cost to buy was $34,380 and to lease was $35,371, making them almost identical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

However, changing certain variables can significantly impact the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>:
*   **Investment Rate of Return**: If your expected investment return is lower (e.g., 3%), buying can become more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. If it's higher (e.g., 10%), leasing might be the better option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Annual Depreciation**: This is the most unpredictable factor but also the one that can swing the decision the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Low Depreciation (e.g., 10%)**: If your vehicle depreciates slowly, buying becomes much more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This might happen with a reliable vehicle or if you drive it minimally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   **High Depreciation (e.g., 25%)**: If the vehicle depreciates quickly (a "lemon"), the net cost of buying can be significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The annual depreciation rate largely determines the car's actual market resale value at the end of the term, which is hard to predict due to supply and demand fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Key Takeaways from Financial Analysis

When comparing [[comparing_leasing_vs_buying_a_car_pros_and_cons | leasing vs. buying a car]]:
*   **High Resale Value**: If a vehicle's resale value is high, buying or financing is generally cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value**: If a vehicle has a low resale value, leasing becomes more cost-effective, especially if you can write off some payments for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Cost**: When buying outright or making a large down payment, consider the [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | opportunity cost]] of what that money could have earned if invested elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

## Limitations of Online Calculators and [[nonfinancial_considerations_when_deciding_to_lease_or_buy_a_car | Nonfinancial Considerations When Deciding to Lease or Buy a Car]]

The main drawback of these calculations is that all the inputs are estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. You cannot know the exact resale value of your vehicle or the precise return on your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The car market is unpredictable; for example, those who leased in 2017 missed out on profiting from soaring used car prices during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Because predicting the market is nearly impossible, [[nonfinancial_considerations_when_deciding_to_lease_or_buy_a_car | non-financial factors]] might outweigh the financial ones in your decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Other Important Considerations

*   **Ownership Preference**: Buy for long-term ownership and customization; lease if you prefer new models every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Tax Write-offs**: Leasing allows for deductible payments, while buying offers depreciation and interest deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This is relevant for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Debt Aversion**: Leasing can mean lower payments without long-term debt, but no equity is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: Buying offers freedom to sell at any time. Leasing locks you into a term but may include conveniences like warranty coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Plans**: Buy if you plan to keep your car for many years; lease if you prefer frequent changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Environmental/Emotional Factors**: Buying might support sustainability more and foster attachment. Leasing provides access to the latest eco-friendly models but might not feel as personal due to higher turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: Buying means covering maintenance post-warranty; leasing often includes maintenance during the lease term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Insurance Costs**: Leased vehicles can potentially require higher insurance, increasing overall costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **End of Lease Options**: Leasing provides the option to buy the car at the end of the term, offering flexibility if you're unsure about committing to a purchase upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Buying Used: A Smart Financial Choice

Buying a used car is often the smartest financial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. By purchasing cars that are 3 to 5 years old, you avoid this initial depreciation hit and get more value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Cars in this "sweet spot" typically haven't developed many major issues yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Additionally, used cars usually have lower insurance costs and less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. With research, a reliable, well-priced used car can be found that meets needs, often with comparable or better features than a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Many investors initially choose mutual funds believing them to be a smart, safe choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, mutual funds can quietly erode wealth due to factors such as convoluted fees, complicated reporting, and excessive jargon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Signs Your Mutual Fund is Holding You Back

There are five key signs that a mutual fund may be detrimental to an investor's financial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### 1. Underperformance Against Benchmarks

A common misconception is that if a mutual fund is making money, it is on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, if the fund is making significantly less than the overall market, investors are losing out on potential wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, earning 10% might sound good, but if the benchmark returned 20%, the fund is underperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

**How to Check Performance:**
*   **Compare to Relevant Benchmarks:** Every mutual fund should be compared against a relevant benchmark, such as the S&P TSX Composite Index for Canadian equity funds or the S&P 500 for US equity large-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The benchmark is typically listed for each fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Use Morningstar:** Morningstar is a tool that provides detailed breakdowns of historical returns, quartile rankings, and comparisons to categories and benchmark indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

**Example: Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A**
This fund, with $4 billion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, has consistently [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | underperformed its benchmark]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Growth of $10,000:** The index growth reached $18,814, while this fund only reached $16,458 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Quartile Rankings:** In 2024, it was in the fourth quartile (bottom 25%) of its category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For its three-year, five-year, and ten-year rankings, it was in the third quartile, indicating consistent [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | underperformance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Trailing Returns:** Over a decade, it trailed the index by 1.41% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. An investor with $100,000 in this fund missed out on potentially tens of thousands of dollars in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

**Scope of the Problem:**
The SPIVA Canada Mid-Year 2024 report confirms that most actively managed funds in Canada [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | underperform their benchmarks]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   In the first half of 2024, two-thirds of Canadian equity funds [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | underperformed their benchmarks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Over 10 years, a staggering 93.4% of actively managed Canadian equity funds failed to beat their benchmark, meaning only about 6% succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### 2. [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | High Fees]] That Eat Away at Returns

Banks earn billions from mutual fund fees, which many investors underestimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Even a 2% annual fee can reduce a final investment value by over 50% over 30 years, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

**Example: The Hidden Cost of a 2% Fee**
An investment of $100,000 earning 7% annually could grow to $761,000 in 30 years with no fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, with a 2% annual fee, it would only grow to $432,000, a difference of nearly $330,000 lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This means 2% in fees wiped out 43% of potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

**Mutual Fund Fees That Destroy Wealth:**
*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER):** An MER over 1.6% for equity funds or 0.75% for bond funds is considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In contrast, most index ETFs charge 0.05% to 0.25%, making mutual fund fees potentially 30 times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Hidden Trailer Fees:** Many mutual funds pay commissions, typically 1%, to advisors, which can incentivize selling high-fee funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **High Trading Fees/Turnover Ratio:** Frequent buying and selling of stocks by some mutual funds incur high trading costs passed on to the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

**Red Flags in Fees:**
*   **Advisor Unwillingness to Explain Fees:** If an advisor avoids clarifying fee structures, they likely benefit from those fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **High Redemption Fees:** Some mutual funds penalize investors for switching investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Segregated Funds:** Some insurance companies sell segregated funds that resemble mutual funds but have extremely [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | high fees]], often 3-4%, and insurance features not needed by most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   **Identification:** Held with an insurance company (e.g., Sunlife, Manulife, Canada Life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, include terms like "segregated" or "guaranteed benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, have fees exceeding 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, or have a maturity period (e.g., 10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### 3. [[risk_management_in_mutual_fund_investments | Fund is Too Risky]] and Causes Stress

Investing should foster peace of mind, not stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. If market drops cause sleep loss, constant portfolio checking, or panic, the mutual fund may be too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

**Signs of Excessive Risk:**
*   **Stress During Market Declines:** Worrying, impulsive selling, or loss of confidence during market dips indicates a misalignment with risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Emotional Reactions to Market News:** High risk can lead to panic selling, locking in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding of Fund Holdings:** Some mutual funds hold volatile assets or have complex, non-transparent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Mismatch Between Investment Timeline and Fund's Risk:** Holding high-risk equity funds when money is needed in a few years can lead to significant short-term losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Impact on "Mental Wealth":** An investment, even if it performs well, isn't worth it if it negatively affects mental clarity and the ability to stay the course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

**How to Address Risk Mismatch:**
*   **Recalibrate Risk Exposure:** A balanced portfolio should align with financial goals, time horizon, and ability to handle volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Take an Investor Questionnaire:** Free tools from firms like Vanguard can help assess risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Consider More Stable Investments:** Switching to a diversified ETF portfolio or a lower-volatility fund can reduce stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### 4. Your Mutual Fund is a [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | Closet Indexer]]

[[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | Closet indexing]] is a practice where a mutual fund pretends to be actively managed but closely tracks an index while charging high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Investors pay for expert decision-making but receive index-like returns, which could be obtained from a cheaper ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

**Example: TD Canadian Equity Fund**
This $7.4 billion fund markets itself as actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. However, its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX Composite Index, while charging a high MER of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Underperformance:** Over 10 years, this fund returned 6.87% annually, while the index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Excessive Fees:** The 2.19% MER significantly reduces returns compared to low-cost Canadian index ETFs like XIC (0.06%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Low Active Share:** A low turnover rate of 12% suggests the fund isn't making bold investment decisions, yet charges high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Financial Impact:** An investor with $100,000 in this fund missed over $20,000 in potential gains over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

**Prevalence in Canada:**
Canada has a poor track record with [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds are invested in [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. A Morningstar study also found that many actively managed Canadian mutual funds have low active share scores, barely deviating from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

**How to Identify [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | Closet Indexers]]:**
*   **Compare Holdings to Benchmark ETF:** If stock allocations are nearly identical to a benchmark ETF, the fund offers little added value for high fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Analyze Long-Term Returns:** If a fund's performance moves in lockstep with an index but charges higher fees, it's likely a [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Check Turnover Rate:** A low turnover rate (under 20%) suggests minimal trading and active decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Consider Tracking Error:** If a fund's returns closely match the index year-over-year, it's probably a [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexer]] in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### 5. [[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds | Tax Inefficiencies]] That Cost Thousands

Even well-performing mutual funds can silently drain returns due to [[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds | tax inefficiencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

**Hidden Tax Traps:**
*   **Distributions Triggering Unnecessary Taxes:** Many mutual funds distribute capital gains, dividends, and interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. If held in a taxable account, investors may owe taxes even without selling, and potentially even if the fund lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Holding High-Dividend Funds in a Taxable Account:** Dividend-paying mutual funds can be tax-inefficient outside of a TFSA or RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While Canadian dividends receive a dividend tax credit, US and international dividends are usually taxed at the full marginal rate, leading to unnecessary tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This is a key example of [[tax_inefficiencies_of_mutual_funds_in_taxable_accounts | tax inefficiencies of mutual funds in taxable accounts]].

**How to Reduce Taxes on Investments:**
*   **Use the Right Accounts:** Keep dividend-heavy or income-generating funds in RRSPs or TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Use taxable accounts for tax-efficient ETFs or capital growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Consider Switching to ETFs:** Many mutual funds frequently distribute capital gains, whereas broad market ETFs can be more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
*   **Rebalance Wisely:** Selling funds can trigger capital gains tax, so strategic changes are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | Alternatives to Mutual Funds]]

If holding high-fee, underperforming mutual funds, it's crucial to explore better [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | alternatives to mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Psychological Trap
> Many investors remain in suboptimal investments due to loyalty to their bank or advisor, or the perceived hassle of switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. However, financial future and family well-being should take precedence over loyalty or minor inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Here are some investment options that offer more transparency and potentially lower fees:

*   **Switch from Series A to Series F Funds:** Series A funds, commonly sold by banks, include hidden advisor fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Series F funds are lower-cost versions without embedded advisor commissions, often accessible through discount brokerages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **ETFs:** Exchange Traded Funds have significantly lower MERs (starting at 0.05%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, offer better tax efficiency, and often outperform mutual funds due to their lower-fee approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. For more information, see [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | Comparing All-in-One ETFs and Traditional Mutual Funds]].
*   **Low-Fee Mutual Funds:** A few actively managed funds exist with reasonable MERs, though they are rare in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **DIY Stock Investing:** For those willing to manage their own portfolio, direct investment in individual stocks and ETFs can be a lower-cost alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors:** Automated investment platforms (e.g., Wealthsimple) provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers:** For active management, professional portfolio managers can offer customized strategies with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% (depending on portfolio size) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Most mutual funds are designed to enrich banks, not investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Investors do not need to accept underperformance, high fees, and poor transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

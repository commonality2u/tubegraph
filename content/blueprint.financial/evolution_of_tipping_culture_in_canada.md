Many Canadians feel pressured to tip more, a sentiment that has grown significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While tipping was once primarily expected in sit-down restaurants, it has now expanded to a wider array of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The History of Tipping in Canada

Tipping in Canada began in the early 1900s, originating as a master-servant custom from Europe, particularly England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. By the 1950s, tipping evolved from a polite gesture into an expectation for services such as dining out, hotel stays, and taxi rides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

By the late 20th century, tipping percentages surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. What began as a modest token of appreciation quickly became a "math equation," with common percentages rising to 15%, 18%, or even 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This shift made tipping feel less like a reward and more like a necessary part of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Tipflation: The Rising Cost of Gratitude

[[public_perception_of_tipping_in_canada | Tipping habits in Canada]] have shifted significantly, with expectations rising across various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Tipping Across Professions
Canadians are tipping more often across a broader range of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:
*   76% tip hairdressers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   74% tip bartenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   71% tip food delivery drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

However, tipping remains less common for hotel housekeepers (34%) and coffee shop workers (29%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The average tip in Canada increased from 16% in 2019 to 20% in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Tipping Trends Across Different Services
Tipping has become a social expectation, particularly in restaurants and bars, where the norm has risen to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Services that previously saw little to no tipping, such as coffee shops and fast food establishments, are now experiencing a rise due to the convenience of digital payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[public_perception_of_tipping_in_canada | Public Opinion]]
Canadians have mixed feelings about tipping, with a growing number questioning its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Recent reports indicate widespread frustration:
*   64% of Canadians report being asked to tip more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   62% feel pressured to leave higher tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

This "tipflation" has seen standards rise sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. In 2016, 43% of Canadians tipped under 15%, a figure that has dropped to 23% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Conversely, the number of people tipping 20% or more has more than doubled from 8% in 2016 to 21% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

"Tip creep" is also causing fatigue, with 83% of Canadians feeling that too many places now ask for tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Despite this, only 13% believe service has improved as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The majority of Canadians (59%) now prefer a service-included model with higher wages for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Regionally, British Columbia reports the highest levels of tip creep (74%) and tipflation (73%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Additionally, 73% of Canadians believe the current tipping system allows employers to underpay their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Tipping, which was once a genuine thank you for great service, now feels like an expected part of the bill, regardless of service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This has created a dynamic where workers sometimes view tips as a right rather than a reward, potentially leading to forced interactions to boost bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Service workers often rely on tips to make ends meet, indicating a systemic issue rather than fault on their part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_global_tipping_customs | Tipping Around the World]]
Tipping cultures vary significantly globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Australia and the UK**: Share cultural ties with Canada but have a more relaxed approach to tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In Australia, tipping isn't expected, and in the UK, a service charge is often included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Asia**: Generally does not expect tipping, with countries like Japan even viewing it as rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. In Vietnam, attempting to tip for good service might result in the server running after you to return the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

In "no tipping" cultures, service quality can be just as good, if not better, and interactions often feel more genuine and less transactional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## The Rise of the Awkward Tipping Machine
Digital tipping machines have become ubiquitous in Canada, appearing in coffee shops, food trucks, and other establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. These machines can make tipping uncomfortable, as they often prompt customers for 15%, 20%, or even 30% tips while the cashier watches, creating social pressure to avoid hitting "no tip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Tips to Defeat the Dreaded Tipping Machines
*   **Carry Cash**: Paying with cash avoids the tipping machine altogether, eliminating the screen and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Be Quick with the Button**: When using a tipping machine, make your choice quickly to reduce the feeling of pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Set Your Tipping Rule**: Decide on your tipping amount before reaching the counter to avoid being swayed by higher options presented on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Remember It's Optional**: Not every situation demands a tip. If the service does not merit it, feel free to skip tipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## [[future_of_tipping_in_canada | The Future of Tipping in Canada]]
Tipping in Canada is evolving but is unlikely to disappear overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Rising Percentages vs. Fatigue**: Tipping percentages have climbed from 15% to 20% and might continue to rise with increasing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, growing "tipping fatigue" could lead Canadians to push back against these higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **No Tipping Models**: Some restaurants, like one in Vancouver, are eliminating tips by paying staff higher wages and including costs in menu prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This hassle-free experience is gaining traction and could lead to more establishments adopting European-style service-included pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Impact of Technology**: Digital tipping screens are making tipping more public and pressured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>, which could inadvertently encourage more people to advocate for no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Cultural Stubbornness**: Tipping is deeply ingrained in Canadian culture as a way to reward good service, suggesting it will not disappear anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

The future of tipping in Canada will likely involve a mix of rising tips, more aggressive tipping technology, and increasing experiments with no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Consumers will need to navigate both traditional and newer no-tipping options, ultimately deciding what works best for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. While the current tipping culture and pressure are strong, consumer vocalness is expected to lead to more choices in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

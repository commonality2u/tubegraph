Many Canadians believe that government pensions like the [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] and OAS are not guaranteed. However, for immigrants, the situation can be more complex, as factors such as when you moved to Canada or where you choose to retire can significantly alter your government payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explains the intricacies of these benefits for new Canadians and outlines strategies to maximize your retirement income.

## Old Age Security (OAS): Residency is Key

Old Age Security (OAS) is not automatically granted, and many individuals are surprised to discover they don't qualify for the full amount, or even any at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Unlike [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]], which is based on working contributions, OAS is entirely dependent on residency in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Key Residency Requirements

*   **10 years in Canada after age 18**: This is the minimum residency required to receive any OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **40 years in Canada after age 18**: This period of residency is necessary to qualify for the full OAS payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **20 years in Canada after age 18**: Crucially, if you plan to retire abroad, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after the age of 18 to continue receiving OAS benefits outside the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Impact of Late Immigration on OAS

If you immigrated to Canada later in life, your OAS benefit may be reduced. For instance, someone who immigrated at age 50 and retires at 65 would have only 15 years of residency after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This would result in receiving only 15 out of 40 years of potential OAS payments, approximately 37.5% of the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Furthermore, if you decide to move back to your home country without meeting the 20-year minimum, you could lose OAS altogether once you leave Canada, depending on the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements

Canada has international social security agreements with numerous countries, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These agreements can assist in qualifying for OAS even if you haven't spent the entire required time in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. For example, if you lived in Canada for 7 years and the UK for 13 years, you might still qualify for OAS under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

It's important to note that these agreements allow Canada to count time spent in certain other countries towards the 10 or 20-year residency minimums, but *not* towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Therefore, you will likely still receive only partial OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP): Contribution-Based

Unlike OAS, [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] is not based on how long you've lived in Canada, but entirely on how much and for how long you've worked and contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. You could have lived in Canada for 40 years, but if you never worked, you wouldn't receive [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

To receive the maximum [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]], approximately 39 years of maximum contributions are needed between the ages of 18 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This target is often difficult for immigrants who arrive later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Lower CPP for Immigrants

*   **Late Arrival**: Immigrating at age 45 and retiring at 65 only allows for 20 working years, which is insufficient to reach the 39-year maximum contribution mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Career Transitions**: Many immigrants may go back to school, start in lower-paying jobs, or operate businesses that do not always contribute to [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Contribution Gaps**: Periods of unemployment or part-time work can reduce your average contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

[[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] calculations use your best 39 years of contributions. While a general dropout provision allows for about 8 years of low or no income to be excluded, 31 years still count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. If you lack these, your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] payout will decrease, even if you earned a high income during your working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

A Canadian-born worker starting [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] at age 65 might expect $10,000 to $15,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, whereas an immigrant who arrived at age 45 might only receive $3,000 to $6,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): Tied to Canadian Residency

For many low-income seniors, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) provides a vital lifeline, potentially adding up to approximately $13,000 per year tax-free on top of OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, GIS is paid only while you are living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. If you leave the country for more than six consecutive months, your GIS benefits will be cut off, even if your income remains low and you continue filing Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

This rule particularly affects immigrants who plan to retire abroad, as there are no workarounds, international agreements, or tax treaties that protect GIS in this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>; it is strictly tied to living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Some retirees use a "snowbird strategy," staying in Canada for at least 183 days a year to maintain benefits like GIS and healthcare, while spending the rest of their time abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## What's at Stake?

Your [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] and OAS benefits are incredibly valuable, potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars over your lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
The average Canadian starting [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] at age 65 receives around $9,696 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, with maximum contributions potentially yielding up to $17,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For those who fully qualify for OAS, the amount for ages 65 to 74 is almost $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

Over a 25-year retirement, these combined benefits could add up to between $460,000 and $648,000, assuming maximum OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Factoring in inflation adjustments (e.g., 2% annual increases), these benefits could grow significantly, reaching $580,000 to $815,000 in actual dollar amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This represents an additional $100,000 to $170,000 just from modest inflation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

However, if you immigrated later in life or choose to retire abroad, you might receive only a fraction of this potential income, or even lose your OAS entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Strategies for Immigrants to Protect Themselves

Even if you don't qualify for the full [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] or GIS, several powerful moves can be made:

*   **[[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delay CPP and OAS if you can]]**: This is the simplest way to boost monthly payments. Delaying [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] or OAS until age 70 can increase your benefit by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While not suitable for everyone, it's a powerful option if you can afford to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Build Your Own Retirement Income**: Do not rely solely on government benefits. Focus on personal savings vehicles such as RRSPs, TFSAs, and other investments. Side income can also significantly contribute to retirement, especially if government benefits are lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Check for Social Security Agreements**: Roughly 50 countries have social security agreements with Canada. These can help you qualify for partial OAS or [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]], even if you haven't lived in Canada for the full 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Countries like the UK, India, the Philippines, and many in Europe are on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It's crucial to check before making any significant retirement moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. If you are close to the 20-year OAS portability threshold and plan to retire in a country without an agreement, it might be beneficial to delay your move for a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Know the Residency Rules Before You Leave**: If considering retiring abroad, ensure you understand how long you've lived in Canada and that OAS will cease if you leave for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Plan Carefully and Get Help**: Immigrants who moved to Canada later in life or plan to retire abroad operate under a different set of rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. With the right strategy, a comfortable retirement is still achievable, along with potential tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### Smart Planning Moves to Consider

*   Coordinate RRSP and TFSA withdrawals to reduce taxable income and avoid OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Plan for a delayed OAS and [[canadian_pension_plan_cpp_basics_and_start_age_options | CPP]] withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Utilize income splitting with a spouse or trusted family member to lower your overall tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Strategically convert RRSPs to RRIFs to avoid unexpected forced withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   Be mindful of foreign exchange risk and how investment income will be taxed in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

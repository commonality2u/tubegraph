The founder of wealthawesome.com recounts the journey from launching the website in 2019 to its eventual sale, and the pivot into a new financial planning venture, Blueprint Financial.

## Background: Wealth Awesome

The website Wealth Awesome was launched in 2019 with an initial financial goal of earning $3,000 per month and reaching 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These goals were significantly exceeded, with monthly earnings sometimes surpassing $20,000, nearing $30,000 at one point, and the site peaking at 250,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Over its operational period, Wealth Awesome generated over $500,000, excluding the undisclosed sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The motivation to start Wealth Awesome stemmed from a dream of becoming a "digital Nomad," which entails having an online income source allowing for worldwide travel and remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The founder also aimed to create a positive impact by educating Canadians on finance and finding purpose in helping people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Income was primarily generated through advertising via premium ad networks like Mediavine, and affiliate commissions from recommending trusted financial products such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from Business Ownership

Running Wealth Awesome provided significant learning experiences, including acquiring technical skills like website design, search engine optimization (SEO), content creation, and data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Business skills like building affiliate networks, monetizing a website, hiring, and managing people were also developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Past professional experience as an analyst, in business-to-business sales, and as a financial advisor proved valuable in growing the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

One of the most crucial lessons was learning to manage the [[challenges_of_running_a_business | challenges of running a business]] and developing mental toughness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The founder realized that despite best efforts, issues will arise, results may not always align with expectations, and self-doubt can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Acknowledging that not everything can be fixed and controlling one's reaction to events were key takeaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Timing also played a role, with the site's launch preceding the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to increased online activity and interest in personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Decision to Sell Wealth Awesome

The decision to sell the website was driven by several factors:
*   **Loss of Passion** After several years, the founder found it increasingly difficult to remain motivated and excited about producing content for the site, indicating it was time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty in Blogging** Concerns about the future of blogging, particularly with advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, created stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The sale occurred somewhat unexpectedly when a friend and former colleague, Q, approached the founder expressing interest in purchasing the website as part of his portfolio of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. The deal was finalized within a couple of weeks, and the founder was pleased to sell to a trusted friend who could bring fresh ideas and manage the site effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## New Chapter: Blueprint Financial

The founder is now embarking on a new business venture, a financial planning company called Blueprint Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This new direction aligns with personal values and skills, focusing on building customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The passion for this new venture stems from a belief that many people haven't optimized their finances and that significant value can be provided to individuals and businesses across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

This shift marks a return to the satisfaction derived from one-on-one connections experienced as a financial advisor in a previous corporate role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The new business aims to offer peace of mind and help clients achieve their financial goals, including potentially adding significant value to their retirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The founder also plans to continue providing free personal finance content on a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

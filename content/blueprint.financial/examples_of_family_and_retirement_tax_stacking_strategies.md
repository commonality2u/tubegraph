Maximizing tax savings in Canada involves not just knowing about individual tax credits, but also understanding how to combine or "stack" them for even greater financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:15">[08:22:15]</a>. Many Canadians are unaware of how certain tax credits and deductions can work together effectively to reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:50">[08:28:50]</a>. This article provides examples of how to implement [[strategies_for_stacking_multiple_credits_for_larger_tax_savings | strategies for stacking multiple credits]] in retirement and for families.

## Retirement Tax Saving Combo

A common strategy for [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | retirement tax savings]] involves combining the Pension Income Amount with the Age Amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:37">[08:37:37]</a>.

### Key Credits for Retirement Stacking

*   **Pension Income Amount**: Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:33">[02:57:33]</a>. This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:04">[03:08:04]</a>. Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:48">[03:14:48]</a>. For those 65 and older, this credit can reduce taxes and is worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:07">[08:42:07]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Tax Credit**: Canadians aged 65 and older can claim this non-refundable credit, designed to reduce taxes in [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. However, if net income exceeds around $44,000, the credit is gradually reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>.

### Example: John and Linda

Consider John and Linda, both retired. John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:19">[08:54:19]</a>.
*   Since both are over 65, they can each claim the Pension Income Amount to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:15">[09:00:15]</a>.
*   John also qualifies for the Age Amount credit, providing him an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:54">[09:05:54]</a>.

The stack savings here are the Pension Income Amount plus the Age Amount, leading to lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:28">[09:10:28]</a>.

### Bonus Tip for Retirement

[[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | Pension income splitting]] can further enhance savings by allowing couples to allocate eligible pension income for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:51">[03:17:51]</a>. By shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket, they can achieve even greater tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:16">[09:17:16]</a>.

## Family Tax Saving Combo

Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:04">[09:33:04]</a>.

### Key Credits for Family Stacking

*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**: Provides tax-free monthly payments to help families with the cost of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>. In 2025, parents can receive up to $7,997 per child under six and $6,774 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:37">[05:15:37]</a>. The benefit is income-tested and payments are issued automatically once eligibility is confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Allows claims for costs like daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:17">[09:46:17]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)**: Provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim $8,081 for a spouse or common-law partner, or for a child over 18, and $2,861 for a child under 18 with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:42">[01:46:42]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>.

### Example: Sarah and Mike

Meet Sarah and Mike, who have two young kids; their children are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefit**: They receive tax-free monthly payments to help with child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:51">[10:03:51]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:14">[10:08:14]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: Since one child has a disability, they get an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:27">[10:14:27]</a>.

The stack savings for Sarah and Mike are the CCB plus the Child Care Deduction and the Caregiver Credit, which can equate to thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:15">[10:19:15]</a>.

### Bonus Tip for Families

Families can also [[introduction_to_income_splitting_strategies | split income]] by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:22">[10:28:22]</a>.

Being self-employed in Canada offers significant opportunities for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This applies to traditional business owners and those in the gig economy, such as Uber drivers or DoorDash deliverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. A dollar of self-employed income is often considered more valuable than a dollar of employee income due to the available tax write-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Claiming Business Expenses

Many costs associated with running a business are tax-deductible, which can significantly lower your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Eligible expenses include:
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>
*   Business travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>
*   Professional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
*   A portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>

**Example:** If you earn $80,000 annually and claim $20,000 in business expenses, your taxable income drops to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. At a 30% tax rate, this results in $6,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Home Office Deductions

For those who work from home, a percentage of household expenses can be claimed as a deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This includes:
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

The deductible percentage is based on the proportion of your home used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

**Example:** If your home office occupies 10% of your home and your annual household expenses total $30,000, you can claim $3,000 as a deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. If your tax rate is 30%, this saves you $900 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Hiring a Family Member

If a spouse or family member assists with your business, paying them a reasonable salary for their contributions allows for [[income_splitting_strategies_for_canadian_taxpayers | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This shifts income to someone in a lower tax bracket, leading to overall family tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

**Example:** If you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 (taxed at 20%), your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This saves you $10,500, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes, resulting in a net family tax savings of $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is crucial for the salary paid to a family member to be reasonable for the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The CRA is very strict on this rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

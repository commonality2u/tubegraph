Canada has established international social security agreements with numerous countries globally, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian nations, and many EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. These agreements are crucial for immigrants to Canada, as they can significantly impact eligibility for government pensions like the Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Function
Social security agreements help individuals qualify for Canadian government pensions even if they haven't spent the full required time living or working in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Specifically, these agreements allow Canada to count periods of residency or contributions in partner countries towards the minimum residency requirements for OAS or contribution periods for CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

### Impact on Old Age Security (OAS)
OAS is primarily based on residency in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. To receive any OAS, a minimum of 10 years of residency after age 18 is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. For the full OAS payment, 40 years of residency are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

Social security agreements can assist immigrants in meeting these residency thresholds. For example, if an individual lived in Canada for 7 years and in the UK for 13 years, they might still qualify for OAS under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This allows Canada to count time spent in the other country towards the 10-year or 20-year residency minimums for OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

However, a key limitation is that these agreements do **not** count towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Therefore, individuals qualifying through these agreements will likely only receive a partial OAS payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

### Impact on Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
Unlike OAS, [[canada_pension_plan_2025_updates | CPP]] is based entirely on an individual's work contributions and duration of contribution, not residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. To receive the maximum CPP, approximately 39 years of maximum contributions between ages 18 and 65 are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Social security agreements can help immigrants qualify for partial CPP benefits even if they haven't worked in Canada for the full duration required for maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This is particularly beneficial for those who arrived in Canada later in life and did not have enough working years to contribute the maximum to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Countries with Agreements
Approximately 50 countries have social security agreements with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Notable examples include:
*   United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>
*   United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>
*   Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>
*   India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>
*   Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>
*   Many European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>

It is important to verify if a specific country has an agreement with Canada before making any major [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

## Planning Implications for Immigrants
For immigrants planning their [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement income and financial security in Canada]] or considering retiring abroad, understanding social security agreements is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

If an immigrant is close to the 20-year OAS threshold for portability (the ability to receive OAS outside Canada), and their planned retirement country does not have an agreement with Canada, delaying the move for a couple of years might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. This strategic delay could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra benefits over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

However, it's important to note that the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is *not* protected by international agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. GIS is strictly tied to living in Canada and will be cut off if an individual leaves the country for more than six consecutive months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. This is a critical consideration for low-income seniors planning to retire abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

In summary, social security agreements offer valuable pathways for immigrants to access Canadian pension benefits, but careful planning and verification of country-specific agreements are essential to maximize benefits and avoid unexpected financial shortfalls in [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

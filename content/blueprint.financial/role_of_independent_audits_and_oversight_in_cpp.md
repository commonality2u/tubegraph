Concerns about the future of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) are common, with many Canadians doubting its availability upon their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, the CPP is more secure than often perceived, largely due to robust independent audits and multiple layers of oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This ensures the [[sustainability_and_trustworthiness_of_cpp_reporting | trustworthiness of CPP reporting]] and contributes to the [[cpps_financial_stability_and_growth_projections | CPP's financial stability and growth projections]].

### Independent Oversight Bodies

The integrity and accuracy of CPP reports are maintained through several independent bodies:

#### Chief Actuary of Canada
The Chief Actuary of Canada conducts detailed assessments of the CPP's financial health every three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This role ensures an impartial evaluation of the CPP's long-term financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The Chief Actuary operates independently, free from political influence, guaranteeing that reports are accurate and unbiased by external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The 31st Actuarial Report, completed in 2022, confirmed the CPP's sustainability for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

#### Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO)
Adding another layer of independent scrutiny, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) reviews the reports prepared by the Chief Actuary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The PBO is recognized for being independent, transparent, and nonpartisan, serving as a reliable source of oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Their primary role is to provide objective, factual analysis to ensure the financial data is trustworthy and unbiased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

#### External Audits
Further assurance of the CPP's financial integrity comes from external audits. For instance, Deloitte's 2022 audit confirmed that CPP Investments maintained effective internal control over financial reporting, thereby reinforcing trust in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This corroborates the findings from the Chief Actuary and PBO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Impact on Trust and Financial Stability

The combination of the Chief Actuary's independent assessments, the PBO's reviews, and external audits provides strong reasons to trust the transparency and accuracy of CPP reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Despite the possibility of audit failures, the multiple layers of scrutiny and transparency make the CPP one of the most reliable and well-monitored funds available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

For Canadians, this multi-layered oversight brings peace of mind, knowing that the CPP is reviewed by multiple independent bodies, audited thoroughly, and projected to remain solvent for at least 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This significantly reduces concerns about the fund running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

> [!tip] Always look for independent audits or third-party reviews when evaluating financial reports, whether for a pension fund like the CPP or a company you plan to invest in. This is crucial for making informed and trusted decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Private Equity (PE) is a high-stakes investment strategy used by wealthy Canadians to grow and protect their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It refers to investments in privately held companies that are not traded on public stock exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These investments often involve funding startups, financing turnarounds, or supporting business expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Unlike traditional stocks, private equity carries higher risk, longer investment horizons, and limited liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, it also offers the potential for significantly greater returns for investors willing to commit their capital for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Private Equity and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs)

RSPs are primarily designed for publicly traded investments and typically do not allow direct ownership of private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) restricts RSP investments to public securities or select CRA-approved private equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This means that most private equity investments need to be held outside an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Despite these restrictions, certain self-directed RSPs provide access to private equity under specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. These accounts allow investors to hold CRA-approved private equity funds, enabling them to enjoy tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Examples include the North Leaf Capital Partners private equity fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, and select private equity investments available through Well Simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Downsides of Private Equity

Like any high-reward investment, private equity comes with notable drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

*   **High Fees**
    Private equity investments involve significant costs, including management fees and carried interest, which can substantially reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Understanding these expenses before investing is crucial as they can dramatically reduce profits over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

*   **High Risk**
    These investments are often highly illiquid, making them difficult to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. There is always a risk of losing the entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, many Canadian investors suffered losses when Walton International Group, a land syndication venture under private equity real estate investing, filed for creditor protection in 2017 after amassing $67 million in losses over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

*   **Long Lockup Periods**
    Investors must be prepared to commit their funds for extended periods, often between 5 to 10 years, before seeing any returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. During this time, the invested funds cannot be accessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:54">[03:00:54]</a>.

Private equity is considered suitable for patient and strategic investors, offering a powerful wealth-building tool beyond an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Private Equity and Trusts

Private equity can be held within a [[Family Trusts for Wealth Management | Family Trust]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This allows for greater flexibility in managing wealth, reducing taxes, and planning for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone, representing a significant 37.8% of that age group who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Retiring solo requires a different approach to [[strategies_for_retirement_planning_and_income_management_as_a_single_retiree | retirement planning]] to avoid common financial mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Income Disparity in Retirement

The average retiree income in Canada reveals a stark difference between couples and single seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for couples aged 65 and older was $74,200 per year ($6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For single seniors, however, it was only $30,820 per year ($2,568 per month), less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Key Financial Risks for Single Retirees

Retiring alone presents unique [[challenges_faced_by_retirees_in_saving_for_retirement | financial challenges]] because there is no partner to split costs, share benefits, or provide a safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Singles often face higher taxes, less government support, and greater pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity & Investment Risk)
The number one fear in retirement is running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. While a couple can share expenses like a Netflix subscription, single individuals must cover everything alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Singles lack a partner's pension or extra savings to rely on, and they generally need more savings than couples to maintain the same lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate:** Follow a sustainable withdrawal rate, such as the 4% rule, potentially adjusting it lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Diversify Investments:** A mix of growth assets (stocks) and safety assets (bonds, GICs) helps prevent running out of funds too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   **Careful Retirement Financial Planning:** Work with a financial planner to create a customized strategy considering your lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every decision, from when to take CPP to withdrawal amounts, matters more when planning solo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden
Being single often means paying more in taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Without access to income splitting or spousal benefits, single retirees can frequently fall into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income because the couple could split income and qualify for full OAS and age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Smart Tax Planning:** How and when money is withdrawn from RRSPs, TFSAs, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the amount of tax paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   **Drawdown Strategies:** Smart timing and drawdown strategies can save thousands in taxes over retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs
Inflation is a "silent wealth killer" that diminishes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. As a single retiree, there is no one to share the burden of increasing costs for groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Planning for inflation is essential to ensure money lasts through a retirement that could extend 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space:** Unlock home equity by downsizing or renting out portions of your property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   **Co-living/House Hacking:** Explore co-living with friends or house hacking to reduce fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   **Relocation:** Consider moving to lower-cost provinces or countries to stretch retirement dollars further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits (No Financial Safety Net)
Single retirees lack the financial safety net of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there are no automatic rollovers for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon passing, which can result in a significant tax hit to the estate and less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited support for single retirees, reducing guaranteed income options for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful RRSP/RIF Withdrawals:** Plan gradual withdrawals from RRSPs and RIFs to reduce the final tax burden on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Regular Beneficiary Review:** Keep RRSP, TFSA, and insurance designations up to date to ensure assets are distributed as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support
Loneliness can pose a financial risk beyond emotional well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies show that single retirees are more susceptible to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Join Community Groups:** Engage in volunteering, social clubs, and classes to stay connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Co-living:** Consider senior co-housing or shared housing arrangements to cut costs and build friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Utilize Tech for Safety:** Use technologies like Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts for personal protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   **Stay Informed:** Be especially vigilant against scams, as older adults living alone are frequently targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### 6. Health and Long-Term Care Costs
Unlike couples, single retirees do not have a built-in caregiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Healthcare costs can accumulate rapidly, and single retirees face higher long-term care expenses compared to couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Typical costs in Canada for home care range from $25-$50 per hour, assisted living from $3,000-$5,000 per month, government-subsidized nursing homes from $2,000-$3,000 per month, and private care over $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Budget for Care:** Allocate a reserve fund or consider long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   **Assign Power of Attorney:** Appoint a trusted individual to make medical and financial decisions if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   **Disability and Critical Illness Insurance:** These policies can help cover major medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   **Proactive [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | Planning for health-related costs]]** is essential because singles lack an inherent caregiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire's Retirement Plan

To illustrate how [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | financial strategies for retirement]] can be implemented for a single retiree, consider Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single individual planning to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Initial Situation
*   **Estimated Spending:** $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Assets:** $200,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Estimated Return:** 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Other Income:** No pension, no spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Health:** Good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Original Plan:** Take CPP and OAS at age 65, money to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Initial Challenges and Solutions
1.  **Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Inflation:** Andy initially didn't factor in inflation. A 2.1% inflation rate would increase his $50,000 annual spending to $55,000 by age 70 and $61,000 by age 75, causing his money to run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
2.  **Mistake 2: Overestimating Spending:** Most people overestimate retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. In reality, spending tends to decrease by about 20% upon retirement and further with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Andy's revised spending estimate was $40,000/year in his 60s/early 70s, $35,000 in his 70s/early 80s, and $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** This adjustment extended his savings to age 85, improving his goal progress from 54% to 94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This highlights how [[factors_affecting_retirement_spending | factors affecting retirement spending]] are crucial for accurate planning.

### Further Optimization
3.  **Delaying CPP and OAS:** Andy was originally receiving $10,000 from CPP and $8,700 from OAS at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. By delaying both to age 70, his CPP increased to $17,000 and OAS to $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** This change pushed his potential shortfall to age 88, making his plan fully funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
4.  **RRSP Meltdown (Tax Smoothing):** Andy's tax rate between ages 65-70 was very low due to primarily withdrawing from his TFSA (which isn't taxed as income) rather than his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. To smooth out taxes, he was advised to draw $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65-69 to cover expenses while delaying CPP/OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** This brought his plan to 102% funded and resulted in a smooth, low effective tax rate (2-3% up to age 76), eliminating any shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### Building a Buffer
Even at 102% funded, a buffer is ideal for [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | securing financial future in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Three additional options were explored to provide more comfort in retirement:
1.  **Work One Extra Year:** Working one more year, earning $80,000, would increase his funding to 114% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
2.  **Monetize Hobbies:** Andy could earn about $10,000 a year for 6 years from his woodworking hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** This would bring his plan to 112% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This is an example of [[alternative_income_sources_for_retirees | alternative income sources for retirees]].
3.  **Airbnb Condo:** Renting out his condo for 6 summer months (when he lives with family) could also generate $10,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   **Impact:** This would also result in a 112% funded plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This illustrates [[strategies_for_managing_retirement_on_limited_income | strategies for managing retirement on limited income]].

Andy preferred the hobby or Airbnb options, as he didn't want to work another year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This highlights [[the_save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | the save or spend dilemma for retirees]] and the importance of starting retirement as quickly as possible in a sustainable manner, given that health can decline with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

This base plan would then be stress-tested against scenarios like market drops, higher inflation, or long-term care needs to provide a robust roadmap and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Retirement as a single person in Canada can be challenging, but thorough planning allows for stretching every dollar, minimizing tax impacts, and living a confident retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Retiring alone in Canada presents unique financial challenges that significantly alter retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64, representing 37.8% of this age group, are heading into retirement as single, divorced, widowed, or separated individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Without a partner to share costs, benefits, or offer a safety net, every dollar becomes more critical for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Income Disparity

The median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older in 2022 highlights a significant disparity between couples and single seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:

*   **Couples**: $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **Single Seniors**: $30,820 per year (approximately $2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

This means single seniors earn less than 50% of what couples do, making [[comparison_of_retiree_financial_situations | financial strategies for Canadian retirees]] crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Major Financial Risks for Single Retirees

Single retirees often face higher taxes, fewer government support programs, and increased pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. With smart planning, however, it is possible to retire comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity and Investment Risk)

The fear of running out of money is the number one concern in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Unlike couples who share expenses, split bills, and benefit from tax savings, singles must cover all costs alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This risk is amplified for single retirees as they lack a partner's pension or extra savings and typically need more savings to maintain the same lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

**Strategies for managing this risk**:

*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: Follow a guideline like the 4% rule, potentially adjusting lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This is part of [[strategies_for_sustainable_retirement_savings | strategies for sustainable retirement savings]].
*   **Diversify Investments**: A mix of growth (stocks) and safety (bonds, GICs) helps prevent premature depletion of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Careful Retirement Financial Planning**: Work with a financial planner to create a customized strategy based on lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every decision, from when to take CPP to withdrawal amounts, matters more when planning for a solo retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden

Being single often means paying more in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Without access to income splitting or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently fall into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income could pay $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income because the couple can split income and qualify for full OAS and age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. [[tax_implications_for_single_retirees | Tax implications for single retirees]] are a critical planning area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

**Strategies for managing this risk**:

*   **Strategic Withdrawals**: How and when money is withdrawn from RRSPs, TFSAs, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the amount of income retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs

Inflation is a "silent wealth killer" that erodes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. For single retirees, there is no one to share the burden of rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Planning for inflation is essential, especially for retirements that can last 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

**Strategies for managing this risk**:

*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space**: Unlocking home equity can provide a buffer against rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Co-living or House Hacking**: Sharing housing with friends or others can significantly reduce fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocation**: Moving to lower-cost provinces or countries is a growing trend to stretch retirement dollars further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits

A major financial disadvantage for single retirees is the lack of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. There are no automatic rollovers for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death, which can lead to a massive tax hit to the estate and less money for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer little to no support for single retirees, limiting guaranteed income options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

**Strategies for managing this risk**:

*   **Careful RRSP/RIF Withdrawals**: Gradual withdrawals can help reduce the final tax burden on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review**: Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance designations are up to date so assets go as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support

Loneliness is not only an emotional concern but also a financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies indicate single retirees are more susceptible to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Scammers frequently target older adults living alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

**Strategies for staying connected and protected**:

*   **Join Community Groups**: Volunteering, social clubs, and classes can maintain engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Consider Co-living**: Senior co-housing or shared housing cuts costs and fosters friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Utilize Technology for Safety**: Features like fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts can provide protection as one ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 6. Health and Long-Term Care Costs

Without a spouse, single retirees lack a built-in caregiver, making planning for healthcare costs crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Health care expenses can accumulate quickly, and single retirees face higher long-term care costs than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

*   **Typical Costs in Canada**:
    *   Home care: $25-$50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
    *   Assisted living: $3,000-$5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
    *   Government-subsidized nursing home: $2,000-$3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
    *   Private nursing home: $5,000+ per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>

**Strategies for planning for health costs**:

*   **Budget for Care**: Establish a reserve fund or investigate long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Assign Power of Attorney**: Designate a trusted individual to make medical and financial decisions if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Consider Disability/Critical Illness Insurance**: These policies can help cover significant medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire â€“ A Single Retiree's Plan

This example illustrates how [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | comprehensive financial planning for retirement]] can address the risks faced by single retirees.

Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single retiree with no pension or spouse, aims to retire this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

*   **Initial Situation**:
    *   **Estimated Spending**: $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
    *   **Assets**: $200,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>
    *   **Expected Return**: 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
    *   **Planned CPP/OAS**: Immediately at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
    *   **Goal**: Money to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>

### Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Inflation

Andy's initial plan for $50,000 annual spending didn't factor in inflation. With a 2.1% inflation rate, $50,000 would become $55,000 by age 70 and $61,000 by age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This would cause his money to run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Mistake 2: Overestimating Spending (Working in His Favor)

Most people overestimate their retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. In reality, spending often drops by about 20% upon retirement and may decline further with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

*   **Revised Spending Estimate**:
    *   $40,000 per year for 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>
    *   $35,000 per year for 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>

This adjustment alone extended Andy's savings to last until age 85, improving his goal progress from 54% to 94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This highlights the importance of accurate [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | spending projections]] in retirement planning.

### Delaying CPP and OAS

Andy initially planned to take CPP ($10,000) and OAS ($8,700) at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. By delaying these benefits until age 70, his income from these sources significantly increased to $17,000 from CPP and $13,000 from OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This change extended his shortfall to age 88, nearly achieving full funding for his plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### RRSP Meltdown for Tax Smoothing

Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA, which doesn't count as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. To smooth out his taxes and cover expenses while delaying government benefits, a strategy called an "RRSP meltdown" was employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

*   Andy would withdraw $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   This boosted his plan to 102% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   His effective tax rate remained low and smooth (2-3%), not exceeding 4% until age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   This ensured no shortfall even beyond age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Building a Buffer with Creative Solutions

While 102% funding is good, a larger buffer provides more comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Here are additional [[supplemental_income_sources_for_retirees | supplemental income sources for retirees]] considered to enhance Andy's plan:

1.  **Work One Extra Year**: By earning his current salary of $80,000 for one more year, Andy's plan would be 114% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Woodworking Hobby**: Andy could earn about $10,000 a year for six years from his woodworking hobby, leading to 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb Condo in Summer**: Renting out his condo while living with family in the summer could generate $10,000 a year for six years, also resulting in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Andy preferred options 2 or 3, as he wished to avoid working another year, emphasizing the importance of beginning retirement sustainably and promptly due to declining health with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Retiring as a single person in Canada can be challenging due to [[factors_contributing_to_falling_retiree_incomes | factors contributing to falling retiree incomes]], but it does not have to be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. By understanding and addressing key financial risks with proper planning, single retirees can stretch their dollars, avoid major tax burdens, and achieve the retirement they envision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This includes detailed tax projections, market risk assessments, healthcare cost planning, and estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

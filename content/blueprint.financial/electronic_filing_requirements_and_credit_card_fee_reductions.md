## Electronic Filing Requirements

Starting in 2025, new Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules will mandate electronic filing for certain businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

*   **Information Returns**: Businesses that file six or more information returns, such as T4s or T5s, are now required to file them electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Corporate Returns (T2)**: Corporations with over $1 million in revenue must submit their T2 returns online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

While these changes may not significantly impact established businesses already using electronic filing methods, smaller businesses or those still relying on manual processes will need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. To prepare, businesses are advised to sign up for a My Business Account if they do not already have one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Credit Card Transaction Fee Reductions

Although not directly related to taxes, significant reductions in credit card transaction fees are set to benefit Canadian business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

*   **Implementation Date**: These reductions will take effect starting October 19, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Fee Decrease**: Small business owners will see credit card transaction fees drop by up to 27% due to new agreements with Visa and MasterCard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Expected Savings**: This initiative is projected to save eligible businesses approximately $1 billion over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, leading to significantly reduced operational costs tied to credit card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Eligibility**: More than 90% of businesses accepting credit cards are expected to qualify for these reduced fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   **In-store Rates**: In-store transaction rates will decrease to an annual average of 0.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   **Online Rates**: Online transactions will experience up to a 7% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Qualification Thresholds**: To qualify, businesses must meet specific annual sales thresholds:
    *   For Visa, annual sales must be under $300,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The majority of Canadians receive less than the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average Canadian receiving 40% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>. Understanding the factors that determine your CPP benefits and how to potentially increase them can help you get closer to the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a>.

## CPP Payouts by Age (2024 Data)

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, with payouts varying significantly based on the age at which benefits begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>.

*   **Standard Age (65):**
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>
    *   Average monthly amount (as of April 2024): $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a>
    *   This means the average is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"></a>.
*   **Early Start (60):** Benefits are significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16"></a>.
    *   Average monthly amount: $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20"></a>
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23"></a>
*   **Delayed Start (70):** Payouts are substantially higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27"></a>.
    *   Average monthly amount: $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27"></a>
    *   Maximum monthly amount: $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah
Consider David and Sarah, both 65 years old and receiving CPP, but with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37"></a>.
*   **David:** Started his CPP at age 60 and receives an average of $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45"></a>.
*   **Sarah:** Started her CPP at age 65 and receives the maximum payout of $1,364 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53"></a>.

## [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | Key Factors Determining CPP Payouts]]

The primary reasons for the difference in CPP payouts between individuals like David and Sarah stem from their contribution history and average earnings. These are the [[contributions_and_earnings_impact_on_cpp | contributions and earnings impact on CPP]].

### Contributions
Your CPP retirement pension benefits are heavily dependent on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07"></a>.
*   **Contribution Mechanism:** Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16"></a>. The YMPE for 2024 is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22"></a>.
*   **Maximizing Benefits:** To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to contribute for at least 39 years, ensuring your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30"></a>. The YMPE changes annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41"></a>.
*   **Direct Relationship:** The more you contribute and the longer your contribution period, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44"></a>.

### Average Earnings
Your average earnings over your career directly affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50"></a>.
*   **Calculation Basis:** CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59"></a>.
*   **Higher Earnings, Higher Benefits:** Consistently high annual earnings that meet or exceed the YMPE will maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03"></a>.
*   **Impact of Gaps:** Years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17"></a>.

#### Example Revisited: David and Sarah
*   **Contribution Period:** Sarah contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period. David had employment gaps and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29"></a>.
*   **Earnings History:** Sarah consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career. David had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced his overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47"></a>.
*   **Consistent Contributions:** Sarah ensured her earnings met or exceeded the YMPE every year, maximizing her CPP contributions. David's inconsistent contributions due to career changes and lower-paying jobs meant he didn't reach the same level of total contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00"></a>.
    *   **David's Outcome:** Due to fewer contribution years and lower earnings, David received only the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19"></a>.
    *   **Sarah's Outcome:** With a full contribution period and consistently higher earnings, Sarah maximized her CPP benefits, receiving $1,364 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30"></a>.

Essentially, the more you earn and contribute to CPP from your paycheck, the higher your eventual CPP benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45"></a>.

## [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payout | Strategies to Maximize CPP Payouts]]

To potentially move from average or below-average CPP payments to the maximum, consider these [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | strategies to optimize CPP benefits]]:

1.  **Work While Receiving CPP:** If you continue working and contributing to CPP up to age 70, these additional contributions can earn you a post-retirement benefit, which increases your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01"></a>. For example, Sarah, at 67, continues working part-time and her additional contributions increase her CPP payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>.

2.  **Drop Out Lower Income Years:**
    *   **General Drop-out Provision:** CPP allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest income years from your benefit calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33"></a>. This equals approximately 8 years if you contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41"></a>. This helps to exclude periods of low or no earnings, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46"></a>.
    *   **Child Rearing Drop-out:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower-earning years from your CPP calculation, which can increase your benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01"></a>.
    *   **Disability Provisions:** If you experienced periods of disability, these can adjust your lower-earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12"></a>.

3.  **Max Out Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career:**
    *   **Meet or Exceed YMPE:** Aim to have your annual income meet or exceed the YMPE, which is $68,500 for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25"></a>. Higher contributions lead to higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42"></a>.
    *   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46"></a>. Alex, for example, started a successful online business that helped him exceed the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02"></a>.
    *   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career, as the more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15"></a>.
    *   **Longevity:** Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24"></a>. Since CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, a longer contribution period with higher earnings generally results in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32"></a>.

## Estimating Your CPP Benefits in Retirement

To determine if you're on track for your desired CPP payout, you can estimate your future benefits using several methods:

1.  **Rule of Thumb:**
    *   CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55"></a>. Previously, it replaced 25% of average work earnings; now, it can replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57"></a>.
    *   For example, an average annual earning of $40,000 would have previously yielded about $10,000 annually (25%), but now could provide around $13,332 annually (1/3rd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10"></a>. This method is a ballpark estimate as calculations can be tricky due to maximum limitations and yearly variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28"></a>. This relates to [[how_cpp_enhancements_affect_different_income_levels | how CPP enhancements affect different income levels]].

2.  **Using Calculators:**
    *   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** This is comprehensive and provides a detailed estimate of future CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51"></a>. It's thorough but can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57"></a>.
    *   **Ativa Calculator:** This offers a quicker and easier estimate, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08"></a>.

3.  **Your Statement of Contributions:**
    *   This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20"></a>.
    *   **Online:** Access it via your My Service Canada account. If you don't have one, you'll need to register; otherwise, you can sign in (e.g., through your bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39"></a>. Once signed in, select "CPP/OAS" and scroll to the contribution section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated monthly CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49"></a>.
    *   **By Phone:** You can call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59"></a>.

## Important Distinctions and Misconceptions

*   **Delaying CPP Start Age:** While delaying your CPP start age (e.g., to 70) significantly increases your payout, it does *not* inherently boost you from an average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10"></a>. The other [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | factors affecting maximum CPP benefit]] (contributions, earnings, drop-outs) are what determine your maximum potential benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate topic relating to [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | factors influencing the decision on when to start CPP]] and [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | financial and actuarial considerations in CPP planning]] and [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | impact of health and life expectancy on CPP decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26"></a>.

*   **Retiring Early and CPP:** Some believe starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36"></a>. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47"></a>. As a general rule, for most individuals, it is often better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54"></a>.

If you are looking to optimize your CPP payouts, consider consulting with a financial expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05"></a>.

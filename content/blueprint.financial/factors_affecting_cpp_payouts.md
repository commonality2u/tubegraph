Many Canadians may be leaving money on the table when it comes to their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. On average, Canadians receive 40% less than the maximum possible payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding the factors that determine CPP payouts and how to [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | maximize CPP benefits]] can help individuals get closer to the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Average and Maximum CPP Payouts

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, even at the same age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payout amount varies significantly based on when benefits begin and an individual's contribution history.

For 2024, the [[average_and_maximum_cpp_payouts_at_ages_60_65_and_70 | average and maximum CPP payouts at age 60, 65, and 70]] are as follows:

| Start Age | Maximum Monthly Payout | Average Monthly Payout |
| :-------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 65        | $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>   | $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>    |
| 60        | $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>        | $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>         |
| 70        | $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>       | $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>        |

The average amount received at age 65 is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Case Study: David and Sarah

David and Sarah, both 65, illustrate this difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:
*   **David:** Started CPP at age 60 and receives an average of $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Sarah:** Started CPP at age 65 and receives the maximum of $1,364 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Key Factors Determining CPP Payouts

The amount of CPP an individual receives is primarily influenced by two factors:

### Contributions
Your CPP retirement pension benefits depend heavily on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Average Earnings
Your average earnings over your career also affect your CPP amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Consistent high annual earnings that meet or exceed the YMPE will maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Gaps in earnings or years with lower earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### David and Sarah Revisited
*   **Sarah:** Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. She consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, ensuring her earnings met or exceeded the YMPE every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **David:** Had employment gaps and started contributing later, resulting in fewer contribution years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He experienced many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. His inconsistent contributions meant he didn't reach the same level of total contributions as Sarah <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

In essence, the more you earn and contribute from your paycheck to CPP, the higher your eventual CPP benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | Strategies to Maximize CPP Benefits]]

Here are some ways to potentially increase your CPP payments from below average or average amounts to the maximum:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working and contributing to the CPP up to age 70, you can earn a post-retirement benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These additional contributions increase your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Example:** Sarah, aged 67, works part-time while receiving CPP. Her continued contributions earn her additional post-retirement benefits, increasing her monthly CPP payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 2. Drop Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions that allow certain low or no-income years to be excluded from your calculation:
*   **General Drop-Out Provision:** You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals around 8 years if you contributed for 47 years (age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This helps exclude periods of low or no earnings, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Drop-Out:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, these lower earning years can be excluded from your CPP calculation, which can increase your benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions:** Periods of disability can also lead to adjustments in your lower earning years, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### 3. Maximize Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career
While challenging, aiming for your annual income to meet or exceed the YMPE is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The YMPE for 2024 is $68,500 and will increase over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting CPP contributions and allowing for additional savings or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Alex started a successful online business, which helped him exceed the YMPE, increasing his CPP contributions and future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher-Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions, as greater earnings lead to higher CPP contributions and future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Longevity of Contributions:** Ensure you have worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings results in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## [[estimating_cpp_benefits | Estimating CPP Benefits]]

Here's how to estimate your CPP benefits for retirement:

### 1. Rule of Thumb
The CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Previously, it aimed to replace 25% of average work earnings, but with the enhancement, it can now replace up to one-third of earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Example:** For average annual earnings of $40,000, CPP would replace roughly $10,000 (25%) before the enhancement, and about $13,332 (1/3) after the enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   This method is best used as a ballpark estimate due to maximum limitations and the need to calculate for every working year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### 2. Using Calculators
For a more tailored estimate, online calculators are available:
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** This comprehensive tool provides a detailed estimate of future CPP payments but can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier-to-use option, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### 3. Your Statement of Contributions
This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Online via My Service Canada Account:** If you have an account, sign in (e.g., through your bank), select "CPP OAS," and scroll to the contribution section to view your contributions, pensionable earnings, and estimated monthly CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Call CPP Directly:** You can also call CPP to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Distinctions and Misconceptions

While delaying your CPP start age significantly increases your payout, it does not, by itself, boost you from an average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The other factors mentioned (contributions, earnings, drop-outs) are what move you towards the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate topic covering [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | financial considerations for starting CPP payments]] and [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | impact of life expectancy on CPP decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

There's a misconception that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. For most individuals, it is generally better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60, due to [[early_cpp_withdrawal_risks | early CPP withdrawal risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

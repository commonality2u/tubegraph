The majority of Canadians receive less than the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average Canadian receiving 40% less than the maximum [00:00:05]. Understanding the factors that determine your CPP benefits and how to estimate them can help you optimize your payouts [00:00:28].

## CPP Payouts by Age (2024)

Not everyone receives the same CPP amount, with payouts varying significantly based on the age you begin receiving benefits [00:00:37].

| Age Started | Maximum Monthly Amount | Average Monthly Amount |
| :---------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 60          | $873 [00:01:23]        | $522 [00:01:20]        |
| 65          | $1,364.60 [00:00:53]   | $816.52 [00:01:03]     |
| 70          | $1,937 [00:01:34]      | $1,159 [00:01:27]      |

The average amount paid at age 65 is 40.16% less than the maximum [00:01:08].

## Key Factors Determining CPP Payouts

Several [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | key factors]] influence your CPP payouts:

### Contributions

Your CPP retirement pension benefits are heavily dependent on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life [00:02:07]. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) [00:02:16]. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 [00:02:22].

To receive the maximum benefit, you typically need to contribute for at least 39 years, ensuring your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year [00:02:30]. The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension will be [00:02:44].

### Average Earnings

Your average earnings over your career also directly affect the amount of CPP you receive, as this relates to your contributions [00:02:50]. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings [00:02:59].

[[importance_of_salary_levels_for_cpp | Higher average earnings]] throughout your career lead to higher CPP benefits [00:03:03]. If your annual earnings consistently meet or exceed the YMPE, your CPP benefits will be maximized [00:03:10]. Gaps in earnings or years with lower income can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits [00:03:17].

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah

Consider David and Sarah, both 65 years old and receiving CPP but with different payouts [00:01:37]:

*   **Sarah:**
    *   Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years [00:03:31].
    *   Consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career, maximizing her CPP contributions [00:03:49].
    *   Receives the maximum payout of $1,364 per month at age 65 [00:04:34].
*   **David:**
    *   Had gaps in employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution [00:03:39].
    *   Had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced his overall contributions [00:03:55].
    *   Receives only the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 [00:04:21].

Essentially, the more you earn and contribute to CPP, the higher your eventual CPP benefits will be [00:04:45].

## Strategies to Increase CPP Payouts

Here are some [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_payouts | strategies to help you get closer to the maximum CPP amount]] [00:02:24]:

1.  **Work While Receiving CPP:** If you continue working up to age 70 while receiving CPP, you can still contribute to the plan [00:05:04]. These additional contributions earn you a post-retirement benefit, which increases your monthly income [00:05:11]. For example, Sarah, at 67, still working part-time and contributing, increases her monthly CPP payouts [00:05:18].
2.  **Drop Out Lower Income Years:**
    *   **General Dropout Provision:** The CPP allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest income years (approximately 8 years if you contributed for 47 years from age 18 to 65) [00:05:33]. This helps exclude periods of low or no earnings, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation [00:05:49].
    *   **Child Rearing Dropout:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years from your CPP calculation, which can increase your benefit [00:06:01].
    *   **Disability Provisions:** Periods of disability can also adjust your lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension [00:06:14].
3.  **Max Out Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career:**
    *   Aim for your annual income to meet or exceed the YMPE (e.g., $68,500 for 2024) [00:06:25]. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits [00:06:42].
    *   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions and providing additional savings or investments for retirement [00:06:46]. Alex, for instance, started a successful online business, which helped him exceed the YMPE [00:07:02].
    *   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher paying positions throughout your career [00:07:15]. The more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP, and the higher your future benefits [00:07:21].
    *   **Longevity in Contributions:** Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings [00:07:24]. Since CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, a longer contribution period with high earnings leads to higher benefits [00:07:34].

## Estimating Your CPP Benefits

Knowing if you're on track for your desired CPP payout is crucial [00:07:42]. Here's how to estimate your benefits:

### 1. Rule of Thumb

CPP has been enhanced to replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE, whereas it previously replaced 25% [00:07:55].
*   *Example:* For average annual earnings of $40,000, CPP now replaces approximately one-third, providing about $13,332 annually, compared to $10,000 previously [00:08:10].
This method is a very general way to gauge your number, as calculations for every working year can be tricky [00:08:34].

### 2. Online Calculators

For a more tailored estimate, you can use:
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** This comprehensive tool provides a detailed estimate of your future CPP payment but can take about 30 minutes and may not be the most user-friendly [00:08:51].
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier option, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement [00:09:10].

### 3. Statement of Contributions

Your Statement of Contributions provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) [00:09:20].
*   **Online:** Access it via your My Service Canada account [00:09:39]. Sign in (or register if needed), select "CPP/OAS," and scroll to the contribution section [00:09:49].
*   **By Phone:** You can call CPP directly to request your statement [00:09:59].

## Important Distinctions

*   **Delaying CPP Start Age:** While delaying your CPP start age (e.g., to 70) does significantly increase your payout, it does not, by itself, boost you from an average payout to the maximum payout [00:10:10]. Other factors, like those mentioned above, are responsible for maximizing the benefit based on your contribution history [00:10:21]. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate topic, influencing your overall benefit amount, which can be further explored in discussions on [[factors_influencing_cpp_start_age_decision | CPP start age decisions]] and [[financial_incentives_for_delaying_cpp | financial incentives for delaying CPP]] [00:10:26].
*   **Early Retirement and Penalties:** Some people believe starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 [00:10:36]. However, the reduction for starting CPP early is generally much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years [00:10:48]. For most clients, it is often better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 [00:10:56].

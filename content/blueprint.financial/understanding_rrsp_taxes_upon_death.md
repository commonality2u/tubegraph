When an individual passes away, their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance is generally added to their income for that year and taxed at their highest marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This can result in a significant tax liability, potentially seeing over half of the RRSP disappear to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

For example, if Michael had an RRSP balance of $700,000 at the time of his death, the full amount would be added to his income, regardless of the Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) of the investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This pushes his estate's income into the highest tax bracket, which could be 53% in Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. At a 53% marginal tax rate, Michael's estate would owe $371,000 in taxes, leaving only $329,000 for his beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Minimize RRSP Tax Upon Death

Several strategies can help minimize the tax burden on an RRSP at death, from easiest to hardest:

### 1. Spousal Rollover

If you have a spouse or common-law partner, your entire RRSP balance can be rolled over to their RRSP or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) tax-free upon your death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This defers taxes until the surviving spouse begins withdrawing the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Immediate tax deferral and allows the surviving spouse control over withdrawal timing for potential future tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Only applicable if you have a spouse or common-law partner, and taxes are deferred, not eliminated, becoming due when the spouse withdraws or passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This is a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### 2. RRSP Rollovers for Dependent Children

In specific situations, an RRSP can be transferred tax-free to a financially dependent child or grandchild, typically if they are dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The child or grandchild won't owe taxes until they begin making withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Avoids immediate taxes if the dependent child qualifies and provides financial support to children or grandchildren in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Strict rules apply regarding dependency (age or disability), and this option is generally not available for most adult children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### 3. [[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_structured_withdrawals | Converting RRSP to RRIF for Structured Withdrawals]]

Instead of leaving an RRSP untouched until death, converting it to a RRIF upon retirement allows for structured withdrawals over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This strategy helps manage the amount withdrawn annually, keeping taxable income in a lower bracket and reducing the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Smooths out the tax bill over several years, avoiding a lump sum tax hit, and enables better [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | tax planning]] by controlling annual withdrawal amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Taxes are still due on withdrawals, and careful planning is required to avoid withdrawing too much and pushing into a higher tax bracket or depleting the RRSP too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### 4. RRSP Withdrawal to Pay for Life Insurance

To protect an RRSP from a large tax hit at death, a permanent life insurance policy can be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The tax-free payout from the policy covers the estate's tax bill, allowing loved ones to receive the full value of the RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Small, gradual RRSP withdrawals can be used to pay the life insurance premiums, spreading out the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Provides a double benefit where the insurance payout is tax-free, and using RRSP withdrawals to fund premiums reduces the RRSP balance, lowering the final [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax hit]] at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Premiums can be paid through gradual withdrawals, avoiding large upfront payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Not everyone qualifies for life insurance, especially those with pre-existing health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Annual RRSP withdrawals for premiums are taxed as income, potentially increasing tax liability during that period, requiring careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### 5. RRSP Income Splitting

With [[spousal_rrsp_rollovers_and_tax_deferral | spousal RRSP rollovers and tax deferral]], the higher-earning spouse contributes to a spousal RRSP in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The higher-earning spouse receives a tax deduction in their higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In retirement, the lower-income spouse can gradually withdraw these funds, taxed at their lower rate, reducing the overall RRSP balance and the potential tax hit at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Reduces the RRSP balance at death by shifting withdrawals to a lower-income spouse, and allows for tax-efficient withdrawals during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Only effective if one spouse is in a lower income bracket and requires careful planning and consistent contributions over time for maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Bonus Strategy for Business Owners: Individual Pension Plan (IPP)

An Individual Pension Plan (IPP) offers a tax-efficient way for business owners to transfer wealth to the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Unlike an RRSP, which is fully taxed as income upon death, an IPP allows children to be added to the plan, effectively passing it on to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The IPP is taken over by the children, avoiding the large immediate [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax hit]] of an RRSP, as they are only taxed as they withdraw funds, spreading the tax liability over many years and even generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

*   **Pros:** Defers taxation, spreads tax liability over many years, results in a lower tax impact by allowing gradual withdrawals, and enables tax-efficient wealth transfer by preserving the full value of the estate without immediate tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Cons:** Requires children to manage the IPP and ensure withdrawals suit their income and corporate situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Corporate involvement is necessary, meaning children must be employed by the business and receive T4 income to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Combining Multiple Strategies

Think of [[estate_planning_and_rrsp | tax planning]] like building a house â€“ combining multiple strategies creates a stronger, more durable financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. By layering these approaches, you can significantly reduce taxes both during your lifetime and when passing your estate to your loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

A common blueprint involves combining:
1.  **Spousal RRSP contributions**: A higher-earning spouse contributes to a lower-earning spouse's RRSP for tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
2.  **Gradual RRSP withdrawals**: Making planned withdrawals to spread out the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
3.  **Life insurance**: Purchasing a policy to cover the taxes owed on the remaining RRSP at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

A "twist" can involve using the gradual RRSP withdrawals to cover the life insurance premiums, further reducing the [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_to_rrif_conversion | tax hit]] and effectively trading RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This approach smooths out the tax burden and maximizes inheritance for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

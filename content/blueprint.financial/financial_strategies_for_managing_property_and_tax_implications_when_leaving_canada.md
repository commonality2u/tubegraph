Leaving Canada permanently requires careful financial management to avoid significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide outlines how various Canadian financial accounts and benefits, including the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Old Age Security (OAS), are affected when you become a permanent non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:01:03]</a>. It also provides a crucial tip regarding property sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

The TFSA is a key account to consider when planning to leave Canada permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:55]</a>.

### Status and Withdrawals
While you are a non-resident of Canada, your TFSA generally maintains its tax-free status in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:22]</a>. You can still withdraw funds from your TFSA while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:28]</a>. These withdrawals will be added back to your contribution room, but you cannot use this room again until you become a resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Contributions and Penalties
As a non-resident, you cannot make new contributions to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:58]</a>. Your existing TFSA can remain open and continue to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:03]</a>. However, if you contribute to your TFSA while a non-resident, you may face penalties of 1% per month on the contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:11]</a>. For example, a $5,000 contribution could incur a $50 per month penalty until it is withdrawn, totaling $600 over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:27]</a>. Additionally, you do not accumulate new TFSA contribution room during the years you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Tax Implications in New Country of Residence
While growth within the TFSA remains tax-free in Canada, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains from your TFSA according to its own tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, the US does not recognize the TFSA, meaning the IRS will tax all income and gains from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:55]</a>. It is important to be aware of the tax rules of your destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:08]</a>. In cases like moving to the US, it may be advisable to collapse the account before moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Pro Tip
Before leaving Canada, consider maximizing your TFSA contribution. This allows your investments to continue growing tax-free while you are abroad, as you cannot contribute more once you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP)

The RSP is another significant account impacted by a move abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Contributions and Withdrawals
As a non-resident, you can still contribute to your RSP if you have available contribution room from Canadian earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:35]</a>. However, without Canadian income, you will not generate new contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:43]</a>. Withdrawals made as a non-resident are subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax, which may be reduced if a tax treaty exists between Canada and your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Tax Implications and Treaties
Your RSP investments will continue to grow tax-deferred in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:05]</a>. However, your new country may tax the income and gains within your RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:07]</a>. Tax treaties can offer relief or exemption; for example, the US will not tax the incoming gains within your RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:19]</a>. Canada has tax treaties with 91 countries, including the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Managing Your RSP Abroad
You can keep your RSP open and manage your investments as a non-resident, but be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees, as these can impact your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:45]</a>. You can also convert your RSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:54]</a>. RRIF withdrawals have similar withholding tax rules (typically 25%, reducible by treaty) and minimum withdrawals are based on your age and RRIF value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:05:07]</a>. For example, the Canada-US tax treaty can reduce RSP withdrawal withholding tax rates to 15% for periodic withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Repatriation
If you return to Canada, you can resume contributing to your RSP based on any new Canadian income you generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

Your CPP benefits are based on contributions made during your working life in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Benefit Payments
Your CPP benefits will continue to be paid regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:13]</a>. The amount received abroad remains the same as if you lived in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Tax Implications
CPP payments may be subject to withholding taxes, depending on the tax treaty status of your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:38]</a>. For example, the Canada-US tax treaty can reduce or eliminate withholding tax on CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:51]</a>. Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:53]</a>. Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries to ensure uninterrupted CPP coverage and avoid dual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:07:06]</a>. CPP survivor benefits and Child Benefits also continue to be paid if the recipient lives abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Receiving Payments
CPP payments can be deposited into a local bank account in local currency, or into a Canadian bank account and transferred using a service like Wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:42]</a>. Payments can also be mailed as checks in Canadian dollars, though this is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Pro Tip
If you are married or in a common-law relationship, explore CPP splitting to potentially reduce your overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

Your OAS benefits are based on the time you spent in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Eligibility Abroad
To receive OAS abroad, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:38]</a>. You might still qualify if you worked abroad for a Canadian company or lived in a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:49]</a>. However, years spent in these countries do not count towards the OAS benefit amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Benefit Payments and Additional Benefits
If you meet the requirements, the OAS benefit amount remains the same regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:09:06]</a>. However, additional OAS benefits, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Survivor Allowance, require you to reside in Canada to receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:16]</a>. Moving abroad will disqualify you from receiving these additional benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Tax Implications
High-income earners may face the OAS clawback (recovery tax), which applies to earnings over a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:34]</a>. This clawback still applies abroad unless you move to a country with a tax treaty with Canada that potentially allows you to bypass it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:42]</a>. Non-residents typically must file a T136 form annually to determine any required repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:47]</a>. Countries without a tax treaty with Canada may impose a withholding tax on OAS payments, typically around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:54]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, there will be no withholding tax on your OAS due to the tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:01]</a>. Always check the tax treaty details for your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:08]</a>. To collect OAS abroad, you must file an annual tax return reporting your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Pro Tip
If you are at risk of the OAS clawback, manage your income through strategic withdrawals from other [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | retirement accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:24]</a>. Also, consider deferring OAS payments up to age 70 (or 72) to increase your monthly benefit by 0.6% for each month deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Managing Your Home Before Leaving Canada

A crucial bonus tip for those planning to move abroad involves your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Avoiding Capital Gains Tax
Consider selling your home before you leave Canada to avoid significant taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:45]</a>. Selling your principal residence after becoming a non-resident can result in large capital gains tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:52]</a>. Canada does not tax principal residences for residents of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Example Scenario
If you buy a home for $500,000, and its value appreciates to $800,000 before you move abroad, selling it after becoming a non-resident could mean paying capital gains tax on the $300,000 increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:17]</a>. Depending on your residency status and applicable tax treaties, this could lead to a significant tax bill, potentially upwards of $75,000 or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:27]</a>. This substantial tax bill could have been entirely avoided by selling the property before leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Seeking Professional Advice
If you are seriously considering moving abroad, it is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional to understand the specific details and implications for your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:44]</a>. Ideally, you should seek advice from professionals in both Canada and your intended destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:50]</a>.

While a custom spreadsheet offers complete control and customization for tracking net worth, several alternative tools are available for Canadians who prefer automated solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Each of these tools comes with its own costs or limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Wealthsimple (formerly "Wetha")

Wealthsimple (referred to as "Wetha" in the transcript) connects to a user's financial accounts, providing an automatic overview of their [[tracking_and_analyzing_your_net_worth | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. While convenient, some advanced features require a paid subscription, which can accumulate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Quicken (replaces Mint)

Mint was previously a popular free option for tracking finances in Canada, but it has since been replaced by Quicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Quicken provides comprehensive financial tracking but requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Its cost may not be justified when free alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## PocketGuard

PocketGuard is a budgeting application designed to help users monitor spending and manage their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. It offers a free version, but access to its premium features necessitates a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This tool is an option for those comfortable with paying for automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Tool

While automated tools like Wealthsimple, Quicken, and PocketGuard offer convenience, they often come with associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. In contrast, a spreadsheet method is free, offers full control, and is highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The choice of tool depends on individual goals and budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. As Peter Drucker stated, "What gets measured gets managed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, highlighting that [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] is a simple step that can lead to significant financial achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Determining the exact amount of money needed for retirement is a common question, and the answer depends on individual circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article outlines various [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | strategies]] to help you figure out your target retirement number in Canada.

## The Importance of Proper Retirement Planning
Properly figuring out how much you should retire with is crucial to avoid a "failed retirement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The primary goal of [[financial planning for retirement in Canada | retirement planning]] is to avoid the "risk of ruin," which means running out of money before the end of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Case Study: Vincent's Failed Retirement
Consider Vincent, who retired at age 60 with $400,000 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He planned to withdraw $40,000 annually, expecting his investments to grow and his savings to last 15 years, relying on government pensions afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Here's how his plan unfolded:
*   **Year 1:** Started with $400,000, withdrew $40,000, leaving $360,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Year 5:** Savings reduced to $200,000 after withdrawals, compounded by minor investment losses instead of expected gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. An unexpected $50,000 home repair expense further reduced his balance to $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Year 10:** His savings were completely depleted to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. With annual expenses of $40,000 and income only from CPP and OAS ($25,000), he faced a $15,000 annual shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Consequences of Running Out of Money
Running out of money in retirement can lead to significant [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Inability to Cover Expenses:** Struggles with essential costs like housing, healthcare, and daily living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Loss of Financial Independence:** Reliance on family or government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Enjoyment:** Restricted ability to travel or handle emergencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Burden on Family:** Nobody wants to become a burden to loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Strategies to Determine Your Retirement Number

### 1. The "Do Nothing" Strategy
This is the simplest, yet most dangerous, "strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. A shocking number of Canadians (over half, or 52%) feel they are behind on their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Alarmingly, 20% of Canadians aged 55 to 64 have no money set aside for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This "ostrich head in the sand" method involves ignoring the problem and hoping it resolves itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Consequences of Ignoring Planning
> Ignoring [[financial planning for retirement in Canada | retirement planning]] can lead to having to work beyond your planned retirement age or relying on minimal government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### 2. Rules of Thumb for Retirement Planning
These methods offer a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

#### Age-Based Savings Target
This rule suggests aiming for specific multiples of your current salary saved by certain ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>:
*   **Age 30:** 1x current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>
*   **Age 40:** 3x current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   **Age 50:** 6x current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
*   **Retirement Age:** 8-10x current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If you earn $60,000 annually:
> *   By age 30: $60,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>
> *   By age 40: $180,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
> *   By age 50: $480,000 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

#### The 4% Rule
This rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings annually without running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For example, $1 million saved would allow for $40,000 annual withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Vincent's 10% withdrawal rate in the earlier example was significantly higher than the 4% rule, contributing to his quick depletion of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

#### Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income
A common rule of thumb is to aim for 70-80% of your pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A more conservative approach suggests 80-90% as a starting point to account for unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Thus, if you earn $100,000 pre-retirement, plan for $80,000-$90,000 annual retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

#### Household Expenditure Statistics
According to Stats Canada data from 2021, the average annual expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was around $61,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. For those aged 40 to 54, this number was significantly higher at $120,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This indicates that average expenses typically drop considerably by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Financial advisors often see retirees spending around $3,000-$7,000 per month for single individuals and $5,000-$9,000 for couples, depending on desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

#### Pros and Cons of Rules of Thumb

> [!NOTE] Pros:
> *   **Simplicity:** Straightforward and easy to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
> *   **Quick Estimates:** Provide a rough guideline to start [[financial planning for retirement in Canada | planning for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Cons:
> *   **Oversimplification:** Do not account for personal circumstances, inflation, or unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
> *   **Risk of Running Out of Money:** Relying solely on these rules can lead to financial shortfalls if expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
> *   **Lack of Flexibility:** They do not adapt well to changes in lifestyle or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### 3. Online Retirement Calculators
Online calculators can provide a quick sense of your [[financial planning for retirement in Canada | retirement readiness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

#### Popular Options
*   **canada.ca Retirement Calculator:** Provided by the government, it's thorough and considers many factors but is not very user-friendly, requiring about 30 minutes to fill out detailed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Wealthsimple Retirement Calculator:** Easy to use with a clean interface, quick to fill out, but may lack detail compared to more comprehensive tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Sun Life Retirement Calculator:** Balances ease of use with a fair amount of detail, making it a good middle-ground option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Online calculators generally work by taking inputs like age, income, savings, planned [[changing_retirement_age_in_canada | retirement age]], and expected expenses, then predict your retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

> *   **User Experience:** Tools like canada.ca's can be cumbersome and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
> *   **Assumptions:** Often rely on assumptions that may not perfectly suit personal situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
> *   **Limited Scope:** May not consider all factors such as tax implications, healthcare costs, or lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
> *   **User Error:** Incorrect input due to lack of financial knowledge can lead to false confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### 4. Comprehensive Financial Planning
For the most thorough approach, consider hiring a fee-for-service [[financial planning for retirement in Canada | financial planner]] who uses planning software to simulate different scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Retirement planning is like a complex math problem with many variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

#### 6-Step Process for Personalized Financial Planning

1.  **Initial Consultation:** A one-on-one video consultation to understand your financial goals, current situation, retirement aspirations, risk tolerance, and specific concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
2.  **Detailed Data Collection:** Gathering specific financial data, focusing on Canadian details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>:

    *   Expected [[changing_retirement_age_in_canada | Retirement Age]] and Desired Lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
3.  **Comprehensive Financial Strategy Development:** Creating a tailored [[financial strategies for Canadian retirees | financial strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>:
    *   **[[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Tax optimization]]:** Optimizing TFSAs and RSPs to minimize taxes and maximize retirement income, including withdrawal and contribution strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Consideration of income splitting strategies and pension income credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
    *   **Investment Management:** Assisting in creating a diversified portfolio with Canadian and international assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
    *   **Retirement Expense Planning:** Considering different phases of retirement spending (higher spending in early years for travel, moderate in middle, low in later years except for potential healthcare costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   **Government Benefits Integration:** Strategically planning when to take [[retirement_strategies_integrating_cpp | CPP]] and OAS to maximize benefits, considering early retirement reductions and deferral increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
    *   **Estate Plan:** Ensuring assets are distributed according to wishes, including wills and tax implications of RSP/RRIF withdrawals upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.
    *   This step creates a detailed retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
4.  **Stress Testing:** Modeling different scenarios to account for various [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>:
    *   **Market Volatility:** How the plan holds up during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
    *   **Longevity:** What if you live longer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   **Inflation:** Impact of rising costs on savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
    *   **Unexpected Major Expenses:** Handling unforeseen costs like home repairs or family financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
5.  **Implementation Assistance:** Helping set up investment accounts, adjusting [[budgeting for retirement in Canada | saving plans]], and coordinating with other professionals like tax advisors or estate planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
6.  **Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustments:** Retirement planning is not a one-time event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Regular reviews and adjustments are made based on changes in life or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Client Success
> One client's estimated combined estate after tax increased from $8.5 million to nearly $9.4 million after implementing strategies, resulting in a gain of almost $900,000 for their beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

#### Pros and Cons of Comprehensive Financial Planning

> [!NOTE] Pros:
> *   **Customization:** Tailored to specific needs and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
> *   **Comprehensiveness:** Covers all aspects of your financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
> *   **Adaptability:** Adjusts to changes and plans for many different scenarios and strategies to increase net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Cons:
> *   **Complexity:** Can be more complex and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
> *   **Cost:** Professional services come with fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
> *   **Assumptions:** Still based on assumptions, and unexpected events like job loss or investment downturns can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Despite these cons, the detailed approach is considered the best way to determine your retirement number as it provides multiple scenarios and stress tests your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. While no plan can predict the future perfectly, this approach greatly reduces uncertainty and provides peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## The "Magic Dollar Amount" for Retirement
The idea that $1.7 million is always needed for retirement in Canada is generally not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The amount needed depends on your lifestyle and desired retirement quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

*   Some retirees manage with $500,000 in low-cost areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   Others typically need at least $800,000 in higher-cost areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   Lavish spenders may require several million dollars and still come close to depleting their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Understanding your needs and planning accordingly, with some "wiggle room" for unforeseen circumstances, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

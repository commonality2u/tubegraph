Retirement planning in Canada often involves optimizing government benefits like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS). A key strategy to both increase payments and potentially avoid the OAS clawback (recovery tax) is to [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | delay the commencement of these benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Understanding the OAS Clawback
The OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax, begins when an individual's income exceeds a specific threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. If annual income reaches or exceeds $153,700, the entire OAS benefit can be clawed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. For those aged 75 and over, the full clawback threshold is $9,481 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. The recovery tax is 15% on the amount of income over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_60 | Delaying CPP Payments]]
One of the most effective [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_payouts | strategies to increase CPP payouts]] and reduce the OAS clawback is to delay your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

Delaying CPP until ages 68, 69, or 70 offers dual [[financial_incentives_for_delaying_cpp | financial incentives for delaying CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>:
1.  **Increased CPP Payments**: Your CPP payments can increase by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly CPP payment at age 65 would increase to $1,420 per month if delayed until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. These higher payments are also indexed to inflation, growing in value over your lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
2.  **Lower Taxable Income**: Delaying CPP lowers your taxable income between ages 65 and 70, which is when the OAS clawback typically becomes a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

> [!example] Peter Parker's CPP Delay
> Peter Parker, age 65, faced an OAS clawback of $811 due to a high taxable income from drawing both CPP and other retirement sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. By choosing to delay his CPP, his taxable income was reduced, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $584 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This represents a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback, in addition to securing higher CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Delaying OAS Payments
Another effective strategy is to consider [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delaying your OAS payments]] up to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

Delaying OAS provides significant advantages:
*   **Increased Monthly Payments**: Your monthly OAS payments increase by 36% if delayed until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. For instance, a $500 monthly OAS payment at age 65 would become $680 per month if delayed to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This can be a substantial boost to retirement income, especially when combined with delayed CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Reduced or Eliminated Clawback**: Delaying OAS can reduce or even eliminate the clawback during earlier retirement years when your income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

> [!example] Peter Parker's OAS Delay
> Peter again faced an OAS clawback of $811 at age 65 because his income exceeded the threshold while he was still earning money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. However, by delaying his OAS until age 70, the entire clawback was eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This smart move avoided lost benefits and secured a 36% higher monthly OAS payment after age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

## Important Considerations
While delaying CPP and OAS can offer significant benefits, it's not always the best approach for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. If you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy, delaying may not be the most beneficial option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. It's crucial to plan specifically for your individual circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Maximizing CPP and OAS benefits]] through delayed commencement provides a dual advantage: potentially avoiding some or all of the OAS clawback entirely, and securing higher payments later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. These [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | strategies to maximize CPP benefits]] and [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | supplement CPP and OAS income]] can save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

For many Canadians, retirement, intended as a time for relaxation, is becoming a significant financial challenge due to falling retiree incomes and rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Understanding the real numbers behind [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retiree incomes]] in Canada is crucial to determine if a comfortable retirement is still possible on an average income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Average Retiree Income in Canada

The average [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retiree income]] in Canada is often lower than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, for Canadians aged 65 and older, the median after-tax income was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:

*   **For couples:** $74,200 per year, or $6,183 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **For single seniors:** $30,820 per year, or $2,568 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

For context, the median income across all age groups in Canada is approximately $95,000 for couples and $33,000 for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This highlights that many retirees live on significantly less than the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, raising questions about the feasibility of a comfortable retirement given rising costs for housing, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Surging Inflation and Its Impact

Retirement income isn't just stagnating; it's actively losing purchasing power due to surging inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

*   Between 2020 and 2022, senior couples saw their median after-tax income drop by 1.4%, from $76,860 to $74,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Single retirees experienced a 1.2% decrease, from $32,720 to $30,820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Concurrently, inflation surged by about 10%, increasing the cost of essential goods like groceries, gas, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Even if incomes appear somewhat stable, inflation acts like a "silent tax," eroding financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It's like a leaky bucket, constantly chipping away at purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Why Average Retirement Incomes Are Dropping

Several key factors contribute to the decline in average retirement incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>:

*   **Weaker Pensions**: Fewer employers offer guaranteed pensions, shifting financial risk onto retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Savings Shortfalls**: Wages haven't kept pace with inflation, making it harder to accumulate sufficient retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Years of Low Interest Rates**: Before recent increases, bonds and savings accounts, often reliable income sources, offered minimal returns, forcing retirees to take on more risk or withdraw more than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Longer Retirements**: Canadians are living longer, meaning their savings need to last for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

This makes smart planning crucial, as retirement isn't just about saving, but about protecting what has been earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Proper planning helps retirees navigate these challenges and minimizes the risk of outliving their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Comparing Retiree Incomes: Where Do You Fall?

Not all retirees are in the same financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

*   A senior couple earning above $74,200 per year is in the top 50% of retiree households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   For single seniors, earning above $30,820 per year places them in the upper half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### The Single Retiree Challenge

Single retirees face a much tougher financial situation than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While they need less overall, their costs do not scale down proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Single individuals often spend about 60% to 80% of what a household spends, but frequently have 50% or less of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Housing Costs**: Rent or home maintenance costs are often the same whether single or part of a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Food and Utilities**: A couple can share expenses, but a single retiree covers everything alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Expenses**: Certain medical and insurance costs are fixed regardless of household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

For single retirees, [[strategies_for_determining_retirement_needs_in_canada | financial planning]] is even more critical to strategically stretch income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Why Many Seniors Keep Working

Retirement does not always mean stopping work completely; many seniors continue working into their later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. In 2022, over 1.9 million Canadians aged 65 and older reported employment income, contributing $58.8 billion in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Reasons for this include:

*   **Financial Necessities**: Some retirees lack sufficient savings to cover expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Inflation Pressure**: Rising costs make it difficult to rely solely on pensions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Personal Fulfillment**: Many enjoy staying active through part-time jobs, consulting, or starting small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While continued work can supplement income, smart planning can create a sustainable financial future without relying on extended employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Financial Planning Scenario: Making Average Income Work

A condensed financial planning session demonstrates how to make an average retiree income work, though a full plan typically involves multiple meetings and hours of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

**Client Profile (John Doe, age 65)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>:
*   **Planned Income**: $30,000 in retirement (around the Canadian average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Desired Spending**: $65,000 in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Assets**: $400,000 in RRSP, $75,000 in TFSA, $50,000 in non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Concerns/Goals**: Not running out of money, leaving money for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Current Investments**: 60% equity/40% fixed income in RRSP/TFSA; 20% equity/80% cash in non-registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Conservative Estimates Used for Planning**: 5.4% for equity, 3.4% for fixed income, 2.4% for cash, and 2.1% annual inflation on spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Initial Assessment: Running Out of Money

Based on John's current plan, significant concerns arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>:

*   His desired $65,000 annual spending would increase due to inflation, reaching approximately $88,000 by age 80 to maintain the same lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   This would require increasingly higher withdrawals from investments, leading to him running out of money around age 78 or 79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   If he were to live to age 95, the amount of money he would need to borrow to sustain his lifestyle would be $1.58 million, exceeding his house value and resulting in a negative estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   Neither goal of having enough money nor leaving money to his daughter would be met under the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Recommendations for a Sustainable Plan

To address these concerns, a financial planner might recommend several strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>:

1.  **Downgrade Housing**: Sell an $800,000 house and purchase a $600,000 house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  **Delay Retirement**: Continue working until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
3.  **Delay OAS and CPP**: Delay collecting Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
4.  **Increase Savings**: Save an additional $1,000 per year into TFSA and $2,000 per year into RRSP over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Investment Allocation**: Increase allocation to equity to be more aggressive, given the longer investment timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
6.  **Decrease Spending**: Reduce annual spending to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

With these changes, the plan becomes sustainable. John would have enough money to live until age 95, incur manageable debt lower than his house value, and ultimately achieve his goal of leaving a good amount of assets to his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## The Importance of Financial Planning

This condensed example illustrates how a well-structured financial plan reduces uncertainty, provides options, and helps retirees feel more secure about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. It can also highlight unrealistic goals, making it better to find out early if a plan is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

If a person relies solely on average income with no assets or home ownership, financial planning becomes even more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The earlier one starts, the more control they will have over their financial future, making it easier to build security over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Retirement is too important to leave to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

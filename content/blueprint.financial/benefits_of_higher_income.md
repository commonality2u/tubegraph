A common misconception exists that receiving a salary raise might result in taking home less money due to being bumped into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For instance, an individual earning $56,000 might believe that a raise to $60,000 would cause them to take home less because it moves them from a 15% federal tax bracket to a 20.5% bracket once their income exceeds $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This misunderstanding often leads to concerns about the [[impact_of_salary_raise_on_taxes|impact of salary raise on taxes]].

## Progressive Tax System

In Canada, the tax system is progressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that you are only taxed at the higher rate (e.g., 20.5%) on the income you make *above* a specific threshold (e.g., $57,375) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. All income earned below that threshold is still taxed at the lower applicable rate (e.g., 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Always Better to Get a Raise

Due to the progressive nature of the tax system, it is always financially beneficial to accept a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea that earning more could result in less take-home pay is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This ensures that there are always [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes|benefits of earning more despite higher taxes]].

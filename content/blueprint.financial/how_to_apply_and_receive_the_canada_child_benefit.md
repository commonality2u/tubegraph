The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17, or about $17,235 per year for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. This cost is nearly that of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The government can cover almost half of this amount through the [[canada_child_benefit_ccb_eligibility_and_calculations | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## What is the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)?

The [[canada_child_benefit_ccb_eligibility_and_calculations | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

Key features of the CCB include:
*   **Indexed to Inflation** The amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Completely Tax-Free** Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

There are no restrictions on how the CCB money can be spent; families can use it for food, housing, education, or other needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Maximum CCB Payments

If a family qualifies for the maximum CCB, the payments over 18 years can total up to $125,500 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

The breakdown of maximum annual payments is:
*   **For children under six:** Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **For children aged 6 to 17:** Up to $6,570 per year, totaling $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
*   **Total for one child:** Up to $125,500 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

There is no limit to how many children you can receive CCB for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. For example:
*   Two children: Approximately $251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   Three children: Approximately $376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.
*   An extreme example of 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

For lower-income families, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Families earning over $135,000 annually spend more, averaging $43,000 per child, while families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## How to Qualify for the CCB

The [[canada_child_benefit_ccb_eligibility_and_calculations | Canada Child Benefit]] is based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, this is the combined income of both spouses minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. As your net income increases, your CCB decreases, with lower-income families receiving the full benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

The reduction in benefits happens in two stages:
1.  **Income between $36,525 and $79,000:** Your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
2.  **Income above $79,000 (after the initial reduction):** An additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over $79,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### CCB Reduction Example (One Child Under Six)
As income increases, the benefit gradually decreases:
*   **$35,000 net income or less:** Full benefit of $7,777 per year or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   **$50,000 net income:** Annual benefit reduced to about $6,884, or $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **$100,000 family net income:** Annual benefit drops to around $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
*   **$130,000 net income:** Benefit further reduces to about $1,814 per year or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

At very high income levels, the benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. For exact numbers, especially with multiple children, use the CRA's CCB calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. The CRA is also available to assist with any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## How to Get Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward:
*   **Automatic Calculation:** The CRA automatically calculates your payments once you [[tips_for_filing_income_taxes_in_Canada | file your taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. No extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **File Taxes Annually:** Ensure you and your partner [[tips_for_filing_income_taxes_in_Canada | file your taxes]] every year, and your child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. [[tips_for_filing_income_taxes_in_Canada | Filing your taxes]] also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Deposit:** Set up direct deposit with the CRA for faster payments directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **Payment Dates:** CCB payments are typically issued between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. Contact the CRA if you don't receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Update Information:** Keep your information up to date with the CRA. Changes in family income (e.g., job loss, marriage, birth of a baby, divorce) or shared custody arrangements can affect your eligibility for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. In joint custody situations, the CRA typically splits payments 50/50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of the CCB

The [[canada_child_benefit_ccb_eligibility_and_calculations | Canada Child Benefit]] is a critical tool for reducing child poverty and supporting families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has significantly impacted:
*   **Poverty Reduction:** Helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   **Family Support:** Supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   **Birth Rate:** Also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

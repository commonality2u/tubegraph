Understanding monthly spending is a common concern for individuals [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | planning their retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article breaks down the average spending for Canadian retirees, what they spend their money on, and how spending changes through different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overall Average Household Expenditures

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which equates to approximately $5,150 per month.

## Breakdown of Key Spending Categories

For retirees in Canada, the largest portion of expenditures goes to shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Below is a [[breakdown_of_household_expenditures_in_retirement | breakdown of household expenditures in retirement]]:

*   **Shelter**: This category includes the cost of main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. On average, retirees spend around $13,814 annually on shelter, or $1,151 per month, which accounts for approximately 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Even though many retirees own their homes, significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities persist, underscoring the need to budget for ongoing home-related expenses even after mortgage payments end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**: Retirees spend about $7,667 annually on food, which averages out to $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This represents 12.4% of their monthly spending and includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. (For more details, see [[average_grocery_spending_in_canada | Average grocery spending in Canada]]).
*   **Transportation**: While generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals, transportation still represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Despite free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation for retirees due to increased medical needs as people age, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**: These take up 5.4% of monthly spending, highlighting the need for continued financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**: Expenses for maintaining the home add up to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Spending Changes with Age

Data from Statistics Canada provides a clear picture of how household spending evolves with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54)**: Spending is at its highest peak during this period, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is driven by higher family needs, such as larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, with a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64)**: Spending begins to decrease slightly to about $99,250 annually on average, or $8,271 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly. There is also a greater focus on paying off mortgages and preparing further for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+)**: Spending drops further to $61,800 annually, or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:04:00]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there is less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Retirement Spending

Average costs in retirement only tell part of the story; there are generally three phases of spending in retirement: high, medium, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Consider Alex, a Canadian navigating these stages:

1.  **Early Retirement (Ages 65-70)**: This is typically a "high spending" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Alex spends about $70,000 annually or $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Housing costs remain high (though reduced if the mortgage is paid off), covering maintenance and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Transportation costs decrease due to no daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Healthcare costs begin to rise, and food spending slightly lessens due to less dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Alex enjoys spending on hobbies and travel, utilizing newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
2.  **Mid-Retirement (Ages 70-75)**: This is the "medium spending" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:30]</a>. Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, possibly due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Transportation costs reduce further, and healthcare expenses continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Food costs remain stable or decrease as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Spending on travel also reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
3.  **Later Retirement (After Age 75)**: This marks the "low spending" phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year, or around $4,160 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:10]</a>. Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Transportation costs are significantly lower as travel becomes rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Healthcare becomes a major expense, including potential long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Food expenses are relatively low, and travel spending halts, with Alex focusing more on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:31]</a>.

This pattern of spending change throughout retirement is typical for many retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Real-Life Observations from Financial Professionals

Financial advisors often observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. On average, retirees may spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Higher-end households typically spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. However, this can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For instance, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This reduction is attributed to factors like lowering housing costs, decreased transportation needs, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends is crucial for [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | financial planning for Canadian retirees]] and building a sustainable retirement budget, allowing for anticipation of changes in spending habits to ensure enough savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

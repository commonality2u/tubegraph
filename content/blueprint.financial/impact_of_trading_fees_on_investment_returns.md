Trading fees can significantly reduce investment returns, especially for those who trade frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. These costs primarily manifest in two forms: brokerage fees and the bid-ask spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Brokerage Fees

Many Canadian brokerages impose a flat fee for each trade, typically ranging from $5 to $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This means that every time an investor buys or sells a stock or Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), an additional cost is incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

For active traders, these fees can accumulate rapidly. For example, making 10 trades per month at $9.99 per trade could result in nearly $1,200 in annual fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This amount of money could otherwise be invested and compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Some actively managed mutual funds may also impose [[early_redemption_fees_in_mutual_funds|short-term trading fees]] if sold within a specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Bid-Ask Spread

The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay (the bid) and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept (the ask) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

For instance, if an ETF is bought at an ask price of $20.10 and later sold at a bid price of $20, the investor loses $0.10 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This cost becomes particularly pronounced with lower-volume stocks and ETFs, which often have wider spreads, making them more expensive to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Early Redemption Fees

[[early_redemption_fees_in_mutual_funds|Early redemption fees]] are penalties charged by some mutual funds and investment products if an investor sells too soon after buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. These fees, sometimes called short-term trading fees, are designed to deter rapid turnover and maintain fund stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. However, they can significantly reduce investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Common occurrence**: Primarily found in mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Fee structure**: Many mutual funds charge fees (typically 1% to 2% of the investment) if units are sold within 30 to 90 days of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. For example, the RBC US Equity Fund charges a 2% short-term trading fee if units are sold or switched within 7 days of buying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce Trading Fees

Several tactics can help minimize the impact of trading fees on investment returns:

*   **Use Low-Cost or Commission-Free Brokers**: Opt for platforms like Wealthsimple Trade or Questrade for ETFs and stocks, which offer lower costs or commission-free trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Minimize Frequent Trading**: Adhere to a long-term investment strategy rather than engaging in frequent trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Use Limit Orders**: Employ limit orders instead of market orders to gain more control over the buy and sell prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Trade High-Volume Assets**: Focus on high-volume ETFs and stocks to lessen the impact of bid-ask spread losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Review Fund Policies**: Before investing, thoroughly review a fund's short-term trading policies, which are detailed in the fund facts document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Hold Investments Longer**: Avoid triggering redemption penalties by holding investments for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Consider ETFs**: Most ETFs do not charge [[early_redemption_fees_in_mutual_funds|early redemption fees]], making them a more flexible alternative to mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

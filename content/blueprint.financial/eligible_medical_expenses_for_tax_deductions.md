Paying for doctor or dentist visits can be costly, even with Canada's healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Fortunately, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to claim some of these out-of-pocket costs on their taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide outlines common medical expenses that can be claimed and strategies to [[maximizing_tax_refunds_from_medical_expenses | maximize your refund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## [[understanding_the_medical_expense_tax_credit_mec | Understanding the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC)]]

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) enables Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Claiming Medical Expenses on Your Tax Return

To claim the METC, expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For expenses for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) from your total eligible expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The resulting amount is claimed as a non-refundable credit, which reduces your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Example: Jessica's Medical Expense Claim

Jessica earns $50,000 annually and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,500 ($50,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% threshold) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Eligible Medical Expenses

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

Eligible prescription drugs and medications can be claimed as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Eligibility**: Must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Medical Marijuana**: Covered with conditions, requiring a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Not Covered**: Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements generally do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

#### Example: Sarah's Prescription Claim

Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,800 ($60,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $3,000 - $1,800 = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Many dental and vision care costs are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Eligible Professionals**: Services provided by licensed professionals such as dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Covered Expenses**: Routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Not Covered**: Purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

#### Example: Alex's Dental and Vision Claim

Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $4,500 ($150,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   The set threshold amount for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 from his total medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   He can claim $3,100 - $2,759 = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> High-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions, for instance, getting laser eye surgery and a root canal in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Medical Travel Expenses

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Distance Requirement**: Applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Additional Claims**: If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Eligible Expenses**:
    *   **Public Transportation**: Bus, train, taxi, flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   **Vehicle Expenses**: Fuel, parking, maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   **Lodging**: Hotel stay or Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   **Meals**: When required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

#### Example: Jennifer's Medical Travel Claim

Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip weekly for medical treatments over three months, spending $800 on gas and parking and $1,500 on meals and accommodations for a total of $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,650 ($55,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,300 - $1,650 = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Jennifer can claim $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

Premiums paid out-of-pocket for private health insurance may be deductible from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Coverage**: Includes plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Not Covered**: Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed**: Premiums for self-employed individuals can be claimed if they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Family Plans**: May allow claiming premiums for your spouse and children to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

#### Example: Mark's Private Health Insurance Claim

Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $2,700 ($90,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   His eligible claim is $3,500 - $2,700 = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, check which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Many costly medical devices and equipment qualify as tax deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Home Modifications**: In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Requirements**: Some devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify; keep records of both the prescription and receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**: Costs for ongoing maintenance, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Example: Emily's Medical Device Claim

Emily earns $65,000 and purchased a CPAP machine for $2,500 for her sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,950 ($65,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,950 = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> While this amount may seem small, combining it with other medical expenses could increase her total deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Ensure large medical purchases are on the CRA's list of eligible medical devices to confirm qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_family_medical_expense_deductions | Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs]]

Properly claiming medical expenses for your family can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows combining medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Knowing which family member should claim them can maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Example: Richard and Pauline's Family Claim

Richard and Pauline, a couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), had the following medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   Total: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses ($1,800) are combined with Richard's and Pauline's ($2,500 + $2,000 = $4,500), totaling $6,300 eligible for Line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Let's evaluate who should claim the $6,300:
*   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Richard**: Earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

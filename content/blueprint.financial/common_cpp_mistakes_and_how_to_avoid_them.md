The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is a crucial source of retirement income for many Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, missteps in managing your CPP can lead to thousands of dollars in lost income during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article explores seven common CPP mistakes and strategies to avoid them.

## 1. Ignoring Tax Implications

One of the biggest mistakes people make with their CPP is overlooking its tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. CPP payments are considered taxable income, which can significantly impact your overall tax situation and potentially lead to Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

**Example: David's Story**
David, age 67, retired with an annual income of $90,000 from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. He started receiving his CPP benefits early, adding an extra $10,000 to his annual income, bringing his total to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This additional taxable income pushed him into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Furthermore, since his total income exceeded the 2024 threshold of $90,997, he faced an OAS clawback, reducing his OAS payments by 15% ($15 for every $100 over the threshold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
Strategic planning is key. Consider delaying your CPP until age 70 to avoid the OAS clawback for a longer period, or adjust your other income sources to minimize tax impact and prevent the clawback altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Ignoring these factors can lead to a lower than expected retirement income and reduce the effectiveness of your overall [[common_retirement_planning_mistakes_and_their_consequences | retirement plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## 2. Trying to Outperform CPP by Investing Early

It's tempting to take your CPP benefits early (e.g., at age 60) and invest the money in the stock market, aiming for higher returns than delaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While the stock market has historical average annual returns of 7% to 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, this strategy comes with significant risks.

**Risks of Early Withdrawal and Investment**
Market volatility is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the TSX index dropped over 30%, taking years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Investing early CPP withdrawals during such a downturn could severely impact your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

**Benefits of Delaying CPP**
Delaying your CPP until age 70 increases your benefits by 42% over what you would receive at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. If you're entitled to $1,000 per month at 65, waiting until 70 would boost it to $1,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This higher payment is also indexed to inflation, preserving your purchasing power over timeâ€”something very difficult to replicate with stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. To match an additional $420 monthly inflation-indexed benefit with a private annuity, you would need to invest around $100,000 upfront between ages 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
Delaying CPP provides a predictable, secure income in retirement, sparing you from the financial uncertainty of relying solely on market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. There are many other reasons to consider delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## 3. Not Considering Your Spouse or Common-Law Partner

When planning your CPP strategy, it's crucial to think beyond your own benefits and consider the impact on your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Pension Sharing
CPP pension sharing allows you and your spouse to split your CPP income, which can lead to significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, if one partner receives $1,200 per month and the other gets very little, you can share the CPP so that each reports about $600 in income, making your overall retirement income more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### CPP Survivor Benefit
The CPP Survivor Benefit provides ongoing income to your spouse if something happens to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The amount they receive heavily depends on when you start your CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

**Example**
If you start your CPP at age 60, your monthly benefits are reduced by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. If your benefit at 65 would have been $1,000 per month, starting at 60 reduces it to $640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If you pass away, your spouse might receive 60% of that reduced amount (around $384 per month) instead of the $600 they could have received had you waited until 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
Ignoring these factors could mean your spouse ends up with less financial support or you miss out on valuable tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Ensure both partners' needs are considered to maximize benefits and secure financial support.

## 4. Ignoring the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB)

Many Canadians overlook the CPP Post-Retirement Benefit (PRB), which is a valuable way to boost your income if you continue working after you start receiving CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

**How the PRB Works**
The PRB provides additional CPP payments based on your continued earnings and contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. If you are under 70 and still working, you and your employer continue to contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. If you're earning near the maximum CPP earning limit, these contributions could increase your CPP income by up to $44.46 per month starting the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
While the monthly amounts may seem small, they are for life and indexed to inflation, meaning they will grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Over several years, these PRB increases can add up to a significant boost in your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. If you plan to keep working after receiving CPP, don't overlook the PRB as an easy and effective way to enhance your financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## 5. Believing the CPP is a Scam

There's a growing belief among some Canadians that the CPP is a scam, fearing it might run out of money or that the system is rigged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. However, these concerns are largely unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

**Evidence of CPP's Sustainability**
*   **Growing Contributions:** CPP contributions are projected to grow significantly, from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion by 2050 for the base CPP alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. This steady inflow of funds is essential for the plan's long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Regular Reviews:** The CPP undergoes regular independent peer reviews to ensure its actuarial assumptions and financial projections are accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The latest report confirms the CPP is financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Investment Performance:** As of 2024, the CPP Investment Board reported a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year, reflecting strong performance that contributes to the fund's growth and provides a solid financial foundation for future payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
The idea that CPP is a scam doesn't hold up when examining the facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The plan is well-funded, rigorously reviewed, and has a strong track record of investment performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Trusting in the CPP is more sensible than assuming it won't be there when you retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## 6. Relying Too Heavily on CPP

Relying too much on the Canada Pension Plan as your main source of retirement income is a common [[common_investment_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them | mistake]] that can lead to financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

**CPP's Role in Retirement Income**
While CPP is designed to replace about one-third, or 33%, of the average worker's pre-retirement earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, this is usually not enough to maintain your pre-retirement standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. For instance, if you earned $40,000 a year before retirement, CPP might provide around $13,200 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This is a good start, but likely insufficient to cover rising costs like healthcare, housing, and daily expenses, especially considering it's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
Over-reliance on CPP can force you to cut back on your lifestyle or deplete savings faster than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. To ensure a comfortable retirement, it's vital to have other income sources such as personal savings, investments, or other pension plans like an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Think of CPP as just one piece of your overall [[common_retirement_planning_mistakes_and_their_consequences | retirement plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## 7. Not Understanding the CPP Disability Benefit

Many people are unaware that the CPP isn't just for retirement; it also includes a disability benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If you become severely disabled before you retire and are unable to work, this benefit can be a crucial lifeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, you must apply for it and meet specific criteria to receive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

**How to Avoid This Mistake**
If an unexpected health issue prevents you from working close to retirement, being unaware of the CPP disability benefit could mean missing out on crucial financial support when you need it most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Inform yourself about the eligibility criteria and application process for the CPP disability benefit to ensure you're prepared for unforeseen circumstances.

A striking wealth gap exists between homeowners and renters in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:54">[01:51:54]</a>. Understanding this disparity is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of wealth accumulation in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:54">[01:51:54]</a>.

## The Growing Wealth Gap

Data from 2024 reveals a significant difference in average net worth between these two groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>:
*   **Homeowners**: Had an average net worth of $1.38 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Renters**: Averaged $274,000 in net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

This means homeowners possessed nearly five times the net worth of renters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. While both groups experienced steady growth in net worth from 2020 to 2024 (homeowners: 33% increase; renters: 31% increase), the initial large difference meant the gap in absolute terms widened significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Drivers of the Disparity

The primary reason behind this substantial wealth gap is the role of [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>:
*   **Real Estate Appreciation**: Property values have significantly boosted the net worth of homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Real estate makes up over 50% of household net worth in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This highlights how much Canadians depend on property to build and store wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Financial Assets for Renters**: Renters, having little exposure to real estate, primarily rely on financial assets for their wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### The Role of Housing Costs

The difference in asset allocation suggests that multi-person households, which tend to have higher net worth, might be more able to afford property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. In contrast, one-person households and likely many renters, may be getting priced out of the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

> While [[impact_of_real_estate_on_wealth_accumulation_in_canada | real estate]] can feel like a safe bet, heavy reliance on one asset class can increase risk, especially in a volatile market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. It is important to diversify investments across real estate, stocks, bonds, and other assets to protect against potential downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. A downturn in the housing market could significantly reduce a household's net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

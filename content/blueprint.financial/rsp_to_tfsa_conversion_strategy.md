Many Canadian retirees can significantly reduce their tax burden by employing a strategic approach to their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals and Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This strategy aims to reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and help retirees keep more of their money for a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A common mistake among retirees is not effectively managing their [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RSP withdrawals]], leading to money being left on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A significant issue contributing to this is wasted [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_strategies | TFSA room]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Statistics reveal that only a small percentage of Canadians fully utilize their TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Out of 17.77 million Canadians holding a TFSA, merely 1.54 million (8.66%) managed to maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This means a vast majority are missing out on the substantial tax-free growth potential offered by the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter their retirement years with significant unused [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_strategies | TFSA contribution room]], often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For instance, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60-64, only 9.48% maximized their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases as retirees age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This RSP to TFSA strategy helps explain this increasing trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

While RSPs are excellent for saving during working years, their withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Upon reaching age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates the [[rrsp_to_rrif_conversion_process | conversion of RSPs into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)]] and requires mandatory withdrawals, regardless of whether the money is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: Redirecting Excess RRIF Withdrawals to TFSA

The core of this strategy is to contribute any excess funds withdrawn from your RRIF, which are not immediately needed for living expenses, into your TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can save thousands of dollars in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Since Eddie is in a 30% tax bracket, he owes $9,000 in taxes, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 of this for his living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead of putting this excess into a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Assuming an average annual growth of 6% in his TFSA:
*   **Year 1:** $10,000 contributed, grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie adds another $10,000 annually, and compounding accelerates growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, which has grown to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Comparison: TFSA vs. Non-Registered Account

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, growing at 6% annually, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, resulting in an effective growth rate of around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

After 10 years, Eddie's non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes, which is significantly less than the $132,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If he had put it into a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the amount would be much lower, potentially around $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Benefits

By consistently contributing his excess RRIF income into his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Achieves a TFSA balance of $132,000, compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

This approach not only maximizes retirement savings but also provides the flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip: Prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a chunk of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Also, avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income from other sources, such as property sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Clarification: Does This Eliminate RSP Taxes?

This strategy does **not** eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals are still considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP (or RRIF) withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The objective is to minimize tax impact while maximizing overall retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

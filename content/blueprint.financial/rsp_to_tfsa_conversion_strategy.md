Many Canadian retirees can reduce their tax bill by using a specific Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A common mistake is not properly managing RSP withdrawals, which leaves money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. By strategically moving funds from an RSP to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), individuals can reduce taxes, increase tax-free growth, and secure a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Unused TFSA Room and High RSP Balances

A significant issue for retirees is wasted TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### TFSA Usage Statistics

Out of 17.77 million Canadians holding a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This indicates that most Canadians are not fully utilizing the tax-free growth potential of the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter retirement with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60 to 64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Interestingly, the percentage of TFSA maximizers increases as retirees age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This increase suggests a specific strategy is being employed, which is explored below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Challenges with RSP Balances

RSPs are effective for saving during working years, but withdrawals are taxed as income and can lead to a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. At age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates the [[rrsp_to_rrif_conversion_process | conversion of an RSP into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF)]] and requires mandatory withdrawals, regardless of immediate need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Transfer

If you do not need all the money from your mandatory RSP/RRIF withdrawals, contribute any excess funds into your TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can save thousands of dollars in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 for living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions cover most costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Instead of putting this excess income into a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Assuming an average annual return of 6%, here's how Eddie's TFSA grows over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>:

*   **Year 1:** $10,000 contribution grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie adds another $10,000 annually, and compounding accelerates growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, which has grown to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Comparison: TFSA vs. Non-Registered Account vs. Savings Account

| Account Type                 | Initial Annual Contribution | Annual Growth Rate | Effective Growth Rate (After Tax) | Balance After 10 Years (Approx.) |
| :--------------------------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **TFSA**                     | $10,000                     | 6%                 | 6%                                | $132,000 (tax-free) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> |
| **Non-Registered Account**   | $10,000                     | 6%                 | ~4% (30% of gains lost to tax)    | $120,000 (after tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> |
| **Taxable Savings Account**  | $10,000                     | 1%                 | Much lower                        | ~$55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> |

By using his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding the annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. His TFSA balance grows significantly more than a non-registered or traditional savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This approach maximizes Eddie's retirement savings and provides flexibility for future needs or continued tax-free compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Key Takeaways and Pro Tips

*   **Prioritize TFSA:** Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room. Let your money grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Manage Withdrawals:** Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of a property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Tax Impact:** This strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals; they are still considered taxable income subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP and [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA withdrawals]], you can reduce your taxable income and potentially avoid penalties like OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

The key is to minimize the tax impact while maximizing your overall [[role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Your retirement savings should work for you, not the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

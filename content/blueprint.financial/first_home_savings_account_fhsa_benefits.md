The [[first_home_savings_account_in_canada | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is a registered account designed to help Canadians save for their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. It combines beneficial features of both the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Many experts suggest that anyone who qualifies should consider investing in an FHSA, potentially even before an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

## Key Advantages of the FHSA

The FHSA offers several distinct benefits:

*   **Flexibility** If you decide not to buy a home, your FHSA savings can be transferred to an RRSP or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. This provides [[retirement_savings_considerations_with_fhsa_and_rrsp | flexibility for retirement savings]] if home ownership plans change.
*   **No Impact on RRSP Room** [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | Contributions]] to your FHSA do not affect your RRSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. This allows for simultaneous savings strategies.
*   **No Repayment Required** Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) under the RRSP, amounts withdrawn from your FHSA for a home purchase do not need to be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Tax-Deductible Contributions** [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | Contributions]] to your FHSA are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. This is a significant [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax benefit]].
*   **Tax-Free Growth and Withdrawal** Funds within the FHSA grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. If used for a qualifying home purchase, the withdrawal is completely tax-free for the down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

## Eligibility for the FHSA

To qualify for an FHSA, you must meet the following criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>:
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>
*   Be at least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>
*   Be a [[fhsa_considerations_for_firsttime_homebuyers | first-time home buyer]], meaning you haven't owned a home in the current year or the previous four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

## How the FHSA Works: An Example

Consider Sarah, a 30-year-old aiming to buy her first home in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. She opens an FHSA and contributes $8,000 annually, with a marginal tax rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

After five years:
*   She has contributed a total of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
*   With tax-free growth, her account grows to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>.
*   She has saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

Here's what happens next in two scenarios:

### Scenario 1: Sarah Buys a Home

Sarah withdraws the $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This tax-free withdrawal significantly enhances her ability to afford a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. This highlights the benefit of [[combining_fhsa_and_rsp_for_taxfree_down_payment | combining FHSA and RSP for tax-free down payment]] strategies if applicable.

### Scenario 2: Sarah Doesn't Buy a Home

If Sarah doesn't buy a home, after 15 years, she can transfer the entire amount in her FHSA to her RRSP or RRIF tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. Her savings will continue to grow tax-deferred until she makes withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

In both cases, the FHSA provides a significant benefit, making it a "win-win" whether you purchase a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. For a [[comparison_of_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | comparison of FHSA and RRSP for home savings]], the FHSA often proves more advantageous, though there are [[situations_where_rrsp_is_advantageous_over_fhsa | situations where RRSP is advantageous over FHSA]].

From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is considered by some to be among the best tax deductions available for a registered account, whether you're planning to buy a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It is a new registered account designed to help Canadians save for their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The FHSA combines some of the best features of both the [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | RRSP]] and TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, offering significant [[financial_benefits_and_flexibility_of_fhsa | financial benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

It is suggested that anyone who qualifies should consider investing in the [[first_home_savings_account_in_canada | FHSA]] before investing in their [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Eligibility for FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

To qualify for an FHSA, you must meet the following criteria:
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Be at least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Be a [[understanding_fhsa_for_firsttime_home_buyers | first-time home buyer]], meaning you haven't owned a home in the current year or the previous four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. (Even if you previously owned a home in Canada, you may still qualify if it was more than four years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.)

## Key Advantages and Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

The FHSA offers several distinct advantages:

*   **Tax Deductibility:** Contributions to your FHSA are tax deductible, similar to an [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This can result in significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Growth & Withdrawals:** Any growth within the FHSA is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. When funds are withdrawn to purchase a home, the withdrawal is completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This significantly boosts your ability to afford a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** If you don't end up buying a home, you can transfer your savings to an [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_to_save_for_a_home | RRSP]] or RRIF without losing the tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. In this scenario, savings continue to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **No Impact on RRSP Room:** Contributions to your FHSA do not affect your [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **No Repayment Required:** Unlike the Home Buyer's Plan under the [[situations_favoring_rrsp_over_fhsa | RRSP]], you are not required to repay amounts withdrawn from your FHSA when buying a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Example Scenario: Saving for a Home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>

Consider Sarah, 30, who plans to buy her first home in the next 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   She opens an FHSA and contributes $8,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Her marginal tax rate is 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   After 5 years, she has contributed $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   With [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | tax-free growth]], her account grows to $50,000 over these 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   Due to the deductions, she has saved $12,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

#### Scenario 1: Sarah Buys a Home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
Sarah withdraws the $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This significantly enhances her ability to afford her home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

#### Scenario 2: Sarah Doesn't Buy a Home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>
If Sarah does not purchase a home, she can transfer the amount in her FHSA to her [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] or RRIF tax-free after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Her savings will continue to grow tax-deferred until she makes withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Ultimately, the FHSA is designed to be a win-win, whether you end up buying a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The [[First Home Savings Account overview | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is a financial tool designed to assist [[firsttime_home_savings_account_fhsa_contributions | first-time home buyers]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It combines features of both a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) to offer significant tax advantages for saving for a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Key Benefits of the FHSA

### Tax-Deductible Contributions
Contributions to an FHSA are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This provides an immediate tax break every year you contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This means that the income used to contribute to the FHSA is not subject to income tax, allowing more money to go directly towards your home purchase goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Tax-Free Growth and Withdrawals
Any investment income earned within the FHSA grows tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When it's time to withdraw the money for a qualifying home purchase, the withdrawals are entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This ensures that every dollar saved goes directly towards your future home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Contribution Limits
Individuals can contribute up to $8,000 per year to their FHSA, with a lifetime maximum contribution limit of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Spousal and Partner Benefits
When buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, each individual can contribute to their own FHSA. This allows a couple to double their combined FHSA savings, potentially reaching $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Third-Party Contributions
If someone else, such as a spouse, contributes to your FHSA, the contribution is treated as if you (the FHSA holder) made it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This means the tax benefits, including deductions and tax-free growth, apply to you as the holder, and the person who contributed has no tax obligation for that contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### No Repayment Requirement
Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) under the RRSP, there is no requirement to repay the money withdrawn from an FHSA for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This eliminates repayment headaches and simplifies financial planning for home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### [[Investment potential of FHSA and RRSP | Investment Potential]]
The FHSA offers significant [[Investment potential of FHSA and RRSP | growth potential]] over time. For example, contributing the maximum $8,000 per year for 5 years to reach the $40,000 lifetime limit, assuming a 6% annual return, could grow the account to approximately $45,000 by the end of those 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. If this $45,000 is left in the FHSA for another 10 years at the same 6% rate, it could grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling the original contribution amount, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

For a couple like Ross and Rachel, each contributing the maximum $8,000 annually for 5 years to their individual FHSAs, their combined $80,000 initial contribution could grow to over $160,000 with a 6% return over the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## [[Combining FHSA and RRSP for home purchase | Combining FHSA and RRSP for Home Purchase]]

The FHSA can be strategically combined with an RRSP's Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) to maximize down payment savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Example: Ross and Rachel
Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home, leveraged both accounts:
*   **FHSA Contributions**: They each contributed the maximum $40,000 to their FHSAs, totaling $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **RRSP Home Buyers' Plan**: They also each withdrew $60,000 from their RRSPs through the HBP, for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Total Down Payment**: By [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_purchase | combining their FHSA and HBP savings]], Ross and Rachel had a total of $200,000 available for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

If their combined FHSA balance grew to $160,000 and they each still withdrew $60,000 from their RRSPs (totaling $120,000), they could have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Even a single individual can use this strategy to save up to $100,000 for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

This [[comparison_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | combined strategy]] significantly accelerates the path to homeownership and reduces financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. It turns what might seem impossible, like saving $200,000 for a down payment, into a real opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

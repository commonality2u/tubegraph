Many Canadian retirees can reduce their tax bill by implementing a simple Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A common error involves not properly managing RSP withdrawals, which leads to retirees leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. By using a smart RSP-to-TFSA tactic, individuals can reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and enjoy a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue is the presence of unused TFSA room among retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
Out of 17.77% of Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This indicates that the vast majority are missing out on the significant tax-free growth potential offered by the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with unused TFSA contribution room, often amounting to tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For instance, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Interestingly, the percentage of TFSA maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This rise is linked to a specific strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. If you are a Canadian retiree not [[maximizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | maximizing your TFSA]], this strategy may apply to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are effective for saving during working years, but withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially pushing you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Upon reaching age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) mandates converting your RSP into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) and beginning compulsory withdrawals, regardless of your immediate need for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

If you do not require the entire mandatory RRIF withdrawal for living expenses, a smart [[balacing_rsp_and_tfsa_withdrawals_to_minimize_taxes | strategy]] is to deposit any excess funds into your TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This approach can potentially save thousands in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who at age 71 has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 per year, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 of this amount for living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions cover most of his costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Instead of placing this excess income in a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Assuming a 6% annual return, hereâ€™s how Eddie's TFSA grows over 10 years:
*   **Year 1:** $10,000 contribution grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie adds another $10,000 annually, and compounding accelerates growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, which has grown to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This demonstrates [[how_to_grow_your_tfsa_from_10000_to_100000 | how to grow your TFSA]] significantly.

### Comparison: TFSA vs. Non-Registered Account

If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account instead of his TFSA, his investments would still grow at 6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, with 30% of gains lost to taxes each year, his effective tax rate would drop to around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Over 10 years, his non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, significantly less than the $132,000 in his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
A taxable savings account earning only 1% would yield even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

By contributing his excess income to his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   His TFSA balance grows to $132,000, compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, and potentially closer to $55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

This approach not only [[maximizing_the_benefits_of_your_tfsa | maximizes retirement savings]] but also provides flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The example used $10,000 for simplicity; your contribution may vary based on your available TFSA room and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip: Prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room, allowing your money to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
> [!TIP] Pro Tip: Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years when you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Does this Eliminate RSP Taxes?

This strategy does **not** eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. RSP withdrawals remain taxable income subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with [[using_tfsa_to_manage_taxable_income | TFSA withdrawals]], you can reduce your taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties like OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The goal is to minimize the tax impact while [[investment_strategies_for_tfsa_growth | maximizing your overall retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Your retirement savings should work for you, not the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

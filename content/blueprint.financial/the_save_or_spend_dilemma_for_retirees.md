After decades of [[saving_versus_investing | saving]], [[saving_versus_investing | investing]], and planning for retirement, many individuals find themselves hesitant to spend their accumulated wealth once they reach their golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This common struggle is known as the "save or spend dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It represents a significant [[impact_of_mindset_on_retirement_spending | mindset]] shift from accumulation to distribution, often making it uncomfortable for retirees to transition from a scarcity [[impact_of_mindset_on_retirement_spending | mindset]] to an abundance [[impact_of_mindset_on_retirement_spending | mindset]] where they feel [[strategies_for_confident_spending_in_retirement | confident spending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This dilemma is prevalent among retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be a Bad Thing

While caution can be beneficial, excessive hesitation to spend in retirement can lead to negative outcomes:

*   **Missed Experiences and Opportunities** Retirees who are reluctant to spend may miss out on enriching experiences such as travel, pursuing hobbies, or even making healthcare improvements that could significantly enhance their quality of life during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Healthspan Versus Lifespan** Dr. Peter Attia, in his book *Outlive*, distinguishes between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending might mean missing the prime years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities can decline, limiting the enjoyment of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Inflation's Impact** Inflation erodes the purchasing power of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While a properly structured retirement plan should account for inflation, if not planned correctly, hesitation to spend means the money sitting unused will buy less in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be a Good Thing

Conversely, not spending all available funds in retirement also has its advantages:

*   **Encourages Cautious Spending** A natural hesitation to spend can promote thoughtful and deliberate financial decisions, preventing impulse purchases and overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Helps Money Last (Reduces Longevity Risk)** A careful approach ensures that retirement funds stretch further, significantly reducing the risk of running out of money prematurely. This is known as reducing longevity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk (Reduces Sequence of Returns Risk)** Spending cautiously helps protect against market losses, especially those occurring early in retirement, which can deplete a portfolio rapidly. This is known as reducing sequence of returns risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Aligns with Legacy Goals** For many retirees, leaving a substantial inheritance for loved ones or supporting charitable causes is a key priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Cautious [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] allows for the achievement of these legacy goals while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The core challenge for retirees facing the save or spend dilemma is often not knowing how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. With many [[factors_affecting_retirement_spending | factors]] and variables to consider, it's natural to err on the side of caution to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, this cautious approach might prevent them from enjoying the wealth they've diligently built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

A well-structured [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | financial plan]] is essential to provide clarity on sustainable [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Stress-testing an [[saving_versus_investing | investment]] portfolio, modeling potential market downturns, and running longevity projections can help retirees move from a [[impact_of_mindset_on_retirement_spending | mindset]] of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Real-Life Examples

### Michael and Karen: Spending More Freely

*   **Client Profile** Michael (66) and Karen (64) had a combined annual income of $180,000 from pensions (CPP, OAS, work pensions) and investments, with yearly expenses of only $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. They had $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their goal was to increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Process** Despite a surplus of $110,000 annually, they were hesitant to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. A financial analysis revealed that with a sustainable withdrawal rate of 3.5% from their $4 million portfolio, they could withdraw an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams already covered basic expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution** Their portfolio was stress-tested for poor market conditions, modeling a 30% decline in early years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Even in this scenario, it remained sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Longevity projections showed their portfolio would last well beyond age 95, even with higher [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Outcome** Armed with this information, Michael and Karen gained the confidence to spend more freely, booking luxury vacations, starting home renovations, and increasing charitable contributions without jeopardizing their [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | financial future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip** Retirees with larger portfolios often find it harder to spend due to deeply ingrained [[saving_versus_investing | saving]] habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Easing into [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] with small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies can help gradually shift the [[impact_of_mindset_on_retirement_spending | mindset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Robert and Susan: Balancing Spending and Legacy Goals

*   **Client Profile** Robert (70) and Susan (68) had a combined annual income of $100,000, expenses of $75,000, and $1.2 million in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Their primary goal was to leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Process** They were very cautious about increasing their [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]], unsure if they could afford more leisure activities while preserving enough for their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A financial review showed that their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually, combined with their income, leaving them with more than enough to cover expenses and increase [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Solution** To balance their lifestyle and legacy goals, a slight increase in [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] from $75,000 to $85,000 per year was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This allowed for more travel and experiences while keeping the inheritance goal intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Stress-testing confirmed that even in adverse market conditions, they could maintain their [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | spending]] without jeopardizing their [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Outcome** Robert and Susan felt confident to enjoy a higher quality of life immediately while still ensuring a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Ultimately, overcoming the save or spend dilemma involves understanding one's true [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | financial capacity]] and gaining the confidence to enjoy the wealth accumulated.

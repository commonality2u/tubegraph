This article explores the average Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) balances in Canada, providing insights into how savings compare across different age groups, income levels, and genders. This data can help individuals assess their own TFSA savings trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Average TFSA Savings by Age

The average TFSA savings show a clear trend of increasing balances with age, reflecting cumulative contributions and compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

*   **Canadians under 20**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $3,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
    *   This amount is considered surprisingly high, especially as it only includes 18 and 19-year-olds who likely have limited income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   **Ages 20 to 24**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $6,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   At this stage, most individuals start having more stable income and make regular contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **Ages 25 to 29**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   People typically become more financially stable, settle into careers, and start considering long-term goals like buying a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Ages 30 to 34**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Ages 35 to 39**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $15,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   During their 30s, people often focus on significant financial goals such as starting a family, purchasing property, or building an emergency fund, leading to larger contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Ages 40 to 44**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $17,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Ages 45 to 49**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   The 40s are a crucial period for maximizing contributions as Canadians approach their peak earning years and retirement becomes a more immediate reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Ages 50 to 54**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $26,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Ages 55 to 59**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $33,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   The 50s are a critical time for individuals to seriously prepare for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Ages 60 to 64**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   This balance reflects decades of compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Ages 65 to 69**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Many Canadians use their TFSAs to cover retirement expenses without worrying about tax implications, making it a key part of their [[role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | retirement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Ages 70 to 74**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $49,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Ages 75 to 79**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $54,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Ages 80 and over**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $56,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

It is notable that TFSA balances generally do not decrease, even for those aged 65 and over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This suggests that, on average, people do not draw down from their TFSAs in retirement, which might not be optimal for tax planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

> [!tip] Average vs. Median
> It's important to remember that these are average balances, which can be influenced by a few very large accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Median balances, which would better reflect a typical person's savings, were not available but would likely be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## [[tfsa_savings_trends_by_gender | Average TFSA Savings by Gender]]

Analyzing [[tfsa_savings_trends_by_gender | TFSA savings trends by gender]] reveals that women tend to save more than men in their TFSAs at nearly every age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

*   **Under 20**
    *   Women's average balance: $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Men's average balance: $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   This early lead suggests women may start saving earlier and develop stronger financial habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Ages 20 to 24**
    *   Women's average balance: $7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   Men's average balance: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Late 20s (Age 25-29)**
    *   Women's average balance: $11,264 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Men's average balance: $10,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Ages 30 to 34**
    *   Men slightly edge ahead with $13,920 compared to women's $13,716 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   This could be where the gender income gap begins to play a larger role in savings ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Ages 40 to 49**
    *   Women's average balance: $22,680 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   Men's average balance: $20,640 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Ages 50 to 54**
    *   Women's average balance: $27,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   Men's average balance: $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   This may reflect a more conservative approach to spending and saving, as well as a heightened focus on long-term financial security as retirement nears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Ages 60 to 64**
    *   Women's average balance: $42,240 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Men's average balance: $39,182 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   The continued gap could be attributed to factors like higher life expectancy and a more cautious withdrawal strategy among women in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:06:01]</a>.

Despite a significant income gap in Canada (where men earn an average of 36% more than women in 2022, with men earning $66,000 and women $48,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, women consistently maintain higher average TFSA balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This suggests that women prioritize savings and make strategic financial decisions, possibly driven by conservative spending habits, a focus on long-term security, and lower-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## [[tfsa_savings_trends_by_income_level | Average TFSA Savings by Income Level]]

Even low-income earners are making good use of their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

*   **Earning $1 to $4,999 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $19,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   This is surprisingly high given the extremely low income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Earning $5,000 to $9,999 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $16,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Earning $10,000 to $19,999 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $2,456 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   It's impressive that even at the lowest income levels, Canadians prioritize their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Earning $20,000 to $49,999 per year**
    *   TFSA balances are relatively steady, ranging from $28,000 to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Earning $50,000 to $74,999 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: just under $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   It's interesting that these balances are comparable to those in the $20,000 to $49,999 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Earning $75,000 to $99,999 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $32,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Earning $100,000 to $150,000 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $36,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Earning over $150,000 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $46,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Earning over $250,000 per year**
    *   Average TFSA balance: $63,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

A surprising aspect of this data is the similarity in balances between those earning $25,000 and $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Despite the wide income range, their average balances remain close, indicating that many middle-income Canadians are maximizing their TFSAs despite having less disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This highlights the value of TFSAs for all income levels, not just high earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## How to Use TFSA Data to Boost Your Finances

This data can be leveraged to improve your personal financial planning:

1.  **Motivate Your Savings**
    *   Compare your current TFSA balance to national averages for your age, gender, and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. For example, if you're 30-34, the average TFSA balance is about $14,000, growing to $40,000 by age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Use these benchmarks to evaluate your standing and set achievable savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
2.  **Start Early to Maximize Compounding**
    *   The earlier you begin contributing, the greater the impact of compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Even a small balance in your 20s can grow significantly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Consistency in contributions, no matter how small, leads to substantial growth by retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
3.  **Plan for Retirement with Your TFSA**
    *   TFSAs are not just for short-term savings; they are an integral part of an overall [[role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | retirement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Canadians in their 60s, with high TFSA balances, demonstrate its value as a tax-free income source in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Aim to build your TFSA for future financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
4.  **Build Wealth Regardless of Income**
    *   You don't need a high income to benefit from a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Canadians earning between $25,000 and $30,000 maintain average balances close to $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Focus on small, consistent contributions; even lower earners can accumulate significant savings over time by sticking to a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
5.  **Make Your TFSA Central to Your Financial Plan**
    *   Regardless of income level, the TFSA is a powerful tool for growing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. High earners can shelter more money from taxes, while middle-income Canadians can consistently build savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Prioritize your TFSA as a key component of your overall wealth-building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
6.  **Focus on Progress, Not Comparison**
    *   While comparing your savings to others can be motivating, personal progress is what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Whether your balance is higher or lower than the average, consistent effort to build wealth moves you closer to your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

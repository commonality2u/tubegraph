From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

[[key_principles_of_becoming_rsp_millionaires | RSP millionaires]] adopt a stoic approach to investing, viewing it as a life-changing mindset, particularly in the realm of wealth building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This philosophy, rooted in an ancient school of thought, emphasizes controlling what is within one's power and disregarding what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Unlike many investors who are swayed by emotion, [[key_principles_of_becoming_rsp_millionaires | RSP millionaires]] adhere to a rules-based system, maintaining consistency regardless of market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## How Stoic Investors Operate

Stoic investors demonstrate distinct behaviors that contribute to their long-term success:

### Ignoring Market Noise
Every day, financial media is filled with both hype and doom, reporting on market crashes, soaring stocks, and imminent recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Stoic investors do not react to these short-term movements, recognizing them as irrelevant to their long-term objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Instead of impulsive decisions, they remain focused on their established plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Controlling Emotions (Fear and Greed)
When stock markets reach record highs, the average investor often becomes greedy, chasing "hot stocks" or making risky bets, only to panic sell when the market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Conversely, [[key_principles_of_becoming_rsp_millionaires | RSP millionaires]] avoid getting caught up in hype and do not panic during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. They trust their chosen strategy, knowing that sticking to the plan is more effective than making emotional decisions over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Accepting Volatility and Finding Opportunities
Markets naturally fluctuate, moving both up and down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While many people panic when their portfolio drops, assuming they are losing money, stoic investors understand that temporary losses are a normal part of long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. They view downturns as buying opportunities, continuing to invest with the knowledge that markets tend to recover and grow over decades, not just hours or days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Why the Stoic Approach Works

Consider two different investors:

*   **Josh, the emotional investor:** He checks his portfolio frequently, sometimes multiple times an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He panics and sells during market drops, and rushes to buy into "hot stocks" when markets rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This leads to frequently selling low and buying high, and incurring additional trading fees, ultimately hindering his returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. His decisions are dictated by emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Ashley, the stoic investor:** She invests consistently and remains calm regarding day-to-day market news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Ashley does not react to short-term movements and continues contributing to her RSP regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. After 30 years, Ashley achieves far greater wealth, not because of brilliant stock picks, but because she remained calm and committed to her plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

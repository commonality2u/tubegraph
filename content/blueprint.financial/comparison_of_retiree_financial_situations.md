Retirement is envisioned as a time for relaxation, but for many Canadians, it presents a significant [[factors_contributing_to_falling_retiree_incomes | financial crisis]] due to falling incomes and rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores the realities of retiree incomes in Canada, highlighting key differences and the importance of [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial planning]].

## Average Retiree Income in Canada

As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older was lower than many might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>:
*   **Couples**: $74,200 per year ($6,183 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Single Seniors**: $30,820 per year ($2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>

For context, the median income across all age groups in Canada is approximately $95,000 for couples and $33,000 for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This means many retirees are living on significantly less than the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Surging Inflation and Income Decline

Retirement income is not only stagnating but actively losing purchasing power due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Couples**: From 2020 to 2022, senior couples saw their median after-tax income drop by 1.4%, from $76,860 to $74,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Single Retirees**: During the same period, single retirees experienced a 1.2% decrease, from $32,720 to $30,820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Simultaneously, inflation surged by about 10%, increasing the cost of essential goods like groceries, gas, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Even with seemingly stable incomes, inflation acts as a "silent tax," eroding financial security and purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to Falling Retiree Incomes

Several key [[factors_contributing_to_falling_retiree_incomes | factors contribute to average retirement incomes dropping]]:
*   **Weaker Pensions**: Fewer employers offer guaranteed pensions, shifting financial risk onto retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Savings Shortfalls**: Wages have not kept pace with inflation, making it harder for individuals to accumulate sufficient retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Years of Low Interest Rates**: Before recent increases, low interest rates offered minimal returns on bonds and savings accounts, forcing retirees to take on more risk or withdraw more than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Longer Retirements**: Canadians are living longer, meaning savings need to last for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Proper planning is essential to navigate these challenges and minimize the risk of outliving savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Comparing Retiree Incomes: Where Do You Fall?

Not all retirees are in the same financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Senior Couples**: Earning above $74,200 per year places a couple in the top 50% of retiree households, while earning less places them in the lower half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Single Seniors**: Earning above $30,820 per year puts a single senior in the upper half, while earning below that places them in the lower 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### [[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | Financial Risks for Single Retirees]]

Single retirees face a much tougher financial situation compared to couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While they may need less overall, their costs do not scale down proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Spending**: Single people often spend 60% to 80% of what a household spends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Income**: However, they often have 50% or less of the income compared to couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Key cost considerations for single retirees include:
*   **Housing Costs**: Rent or home maintenance costs are often the same for singles as for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Food and Utilities**: A single retiree covers all grocery expenses and utility bills on their own, unlike couples who can share and split costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Expenses**: Certain medical and insurance costs are fixed regardless of household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

For these reasons, [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | financial planning]] is even more crucial for single retirees to strategically stretch their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Budgeting in Phases
> Most retirees spend more in their first 10 to 15 years on activities like travel, hobbies, and home renovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. [[stages_of_retirement_spending | Structuring a retirement plan]] to account for this "active phase" is a key part of [[calculating_retirement_expenses | calculating retirement expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Why Many Seniors Keep Working

A surprising number of seniors continue working into their later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In 2022, over 1.9 million Canadians aged 65 and older reported employment income, totaling $58.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Reasons for continuing to work include:
*   **Financial Necessity**: Many retirees simply lack sufficient savings to cover their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Inflation Pressure**: Rising costs make it difficult to rely solely on pensions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Personal Fulfillment**: Some seniors enjoy staying active through part-time jobs, consulting, or starting small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While working can supplement income, it's not the only strategy. [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | Smart planning]] can help create a sustainable financial future without relying on extended employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## A Financial Planning Scenario: John Doe

A quick financial planning scenario demonstrates how planning can make an average retiree income work, even for those with assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Initial Assessment
John Doe, age 65, plans to retire soon with an income of about $30,000 (around the Canadian average for a single senior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. He hopes to spend $65,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. His assets include $400,000 in an RRSP, $75,000 in a TFSA, and $50,000 in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. His main concern is running out of money and he wants to leave some money for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Using conservative estimates for returns (e.g., 5.4% for equity, 3.4% for fixed income, 2.4% for cash) and inflation at 2.1% on spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, an initial assessment using spreadsheet software (similar to a [[pros_and_cons_of_retirement_calculators | retirement calculator]]) reveals significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>:
*   **Inflation Impact**: The desired $65,000 lifestyle would require $88,000 by age 80 due to inflation, necessitating higher withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Running Out of Money**: John would run out of money around age 78, with nothing left by age 79 except his principal residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Negative Estate**: To sustain the lifestyle until age 95, John would need to borrow $1.58 million, exceeding the growth on his house, resulting in a negative estate and failing his goal of leaving money for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Recommendations
Based on this initial analysis, recommendations to improve John's financial outlook include:
1.  **Downgrade Housing**: Sell an $800,000 house and purchase a $600,000 house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
2.  **Delay Retirement**: Delaying retirement to age 70 allows for delayed OAS and CPP benefits, and enables more savings over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
3.  **Increase Savings**: Save an additional $1,000 annually into a TFSA and $2,000 annually into an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Investment Aggressiveness**: Increase asset allocation into equity due to a longer investment time frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
5.  **Decrease Spending**: Reduce annual spending to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Outcome
With these adjustments, John's plan becomes sustainable. He would not run out of money by age 95, would have manageable debt (lower than his house value), and would achieve his goal of leaving a good amount of assets to his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

This example, though condensed, illustrates how a well-structured plan helps reduce uncertainty, provides options, and allows retirees to feel more secure about their future. It also highlights if goals are unrealistic early on, which is better to discover before retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This type of [[understanding_retirement_income_sources_and_withdrawals | financial planning]] is even more crucial for those relying solely on average income without assets or home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The earlier one starts, the more control they have over their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

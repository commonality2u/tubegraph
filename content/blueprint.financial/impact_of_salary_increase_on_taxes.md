A common misconception among Canadians is the belief that if a raise pushes them into a higher federal tax bracket, their entire salary will then be taxed at that new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. For instance, a salary increase from $55,000 to $60,000 a year could bump an individual into the next federal tax bracket, potentially raising concerns about the entire income being taxed at 20.5% instead of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This can lead to the incorrect feeling that earning more money results in actually losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How Marginal Tax Brackets Work

The Canadian tax system operates on a marginal basis, meaning that different portions of your income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When you enter a higher tax bracket, only the income that falls *within* that higher bracket is taxed at the new rate, not your entire salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

For example:
*   The first $57,375 of your income is still taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   If your salary increases to $60,000, only the additional $2,625 (which is the amount above $57,375) is taxed at the higher rate of 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   The remainder of your income up to $57,375 continues to be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This means your average or effective tax rate remains significantly lower than the highest marginal rate you reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

Even if a raise pushes you into a higher tax bracket, you will always take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It's important not to let tax misconceptions deter you from pursuing a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

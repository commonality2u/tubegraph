A common misconception in Canada is the belief that when a person's income increases and pushes them into a higher federal tax bracket, their entire salary is then taxed at the new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13"></a>. This can lead to the false impression that earning more money might actually result in less take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21"></a>. This misunderstanding is one of several [[myths_about_higher_tax_brackets | myths about higher tax brackets]].

## How Tax Brackets Actually Work

Canada's tax system is progressive, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>. This is key to [[understanding_tax_brackets | understanding tax brackets]].

Consider an example:
*   If an individual's salary increases from $55,000 to $60,000 annually, they enter a new federal tax bracket, moving from a 15% rate to a 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00"></a>.
*   However, only the portion of their income that falls into the higher bracket is taxed at the new rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>.
*   For instance, the first $57,375 of income would still be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>.
*   Only the amount above that threshold—in this example, the additional $2,625—is taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34"></a>. The remaining income continues to be taxed at the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>.

## Effective Tax Rate vs. Marginal Tax Rate

This progressive system means that the average, or [[effective_tax_rate_vs_marginal_tax_rate | effective tax rate]], is significantly lower than the highest marginal rate applied to the last dollars earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44"></a>.

Even when entering a higher tax bracket, individuals will still take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a>. More income is always beneficial and brings [[financial_benefits_of_higher_income_despite_higher_tax_bracket | financial benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"></a>. Therefore, misconceptions about tax rates should not deter individuals from seeking or accepting a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56"></a>.

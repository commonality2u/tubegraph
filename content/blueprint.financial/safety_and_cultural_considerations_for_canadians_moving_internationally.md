When considering [[key_factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | moving abroad]], Canadians often prioritize safety and cultural integration as key factors alongside financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Nearly 40% of new Canadians are thinking about leaving their province or the country due to skyrocketing living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Key Considerations

When evaluating potential destinations, the following factors are often considered:
*   **Safety**: This includes assessing crime rates, political stability, and the potential for natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Weather/Climate**: For Canadians, escaping cold winters often means seeking sunnier and warmer climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Cultural Fit**: This involves understanding the local culture, ease of language adoption, and the presence of an expatriate community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Time Difference**: For maintaining connections with Canada, time zone alignment can be a practical consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

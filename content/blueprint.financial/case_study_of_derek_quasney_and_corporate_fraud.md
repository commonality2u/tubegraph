Many Canadians mistakenly believe that [[overview_of_tax_fraud_consequences_in_canada | tax fraud]] is a minor offense, resulting in only a small fine and a warning from the [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this is far from the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Within a single year, the [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]] convicted 23 individuals for [[overview_of_tax_fraud_consequences_in_canada | tax fraud]], with 10 of them receiving jail sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Derek Quasney's case serves as a prime example of the severe consequences faced by those who attempt to defraud the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## How a CFO's Greed Led to Prison

Derek Quasney, the Chief Financial Officer of the Lake Louise Ski Resort, had a well-established reputation and held a position of trust, overseeing the company's finances from Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Between 2015 and 2017, Quasney began illicitly diverting the resort's funds for his personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This dangerous game ultimately led to the loss of his career, his freedom, and over $700,000 in fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Methods of Misappropriation

Quasney employed three distinct methods to funnel money into his own accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

1.  **Misdirected Company Checks**: He signed company checks, but instead of directing them to vendors or business expenses, he made them out to his personal credit card and bank accounts. This netted him a significant $265,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
2.  **Vehicle Allowance Double-Dipping**: Despite already receiving a $700 per month vehicle allowance through his payroll, he falsely claimed it again in his expense reports, acquiring an additional $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  **Double Salary Deposits**: In a more audacious move, Quasney arranged for his salary to be deposited twice – once into one bank account and again into another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This single "trick" earned him an extra $73,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

In total, Quasney misappropriated over $350,000 from his employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. His most significant error, however, was failing to report any of this income to the Canada Revenue Agency ([[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Cost of Getting Caught

When the case proceeded to court, Quasney faced severe repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:

*   **Canmore Court Conviction**: He received a fraud conviction in Canmore, resulting in 4.5 years in prison and a $669,000 fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Calgary Court Conviction**: He was also convicted of [[avoiding_tax_evasion_and_aggressive_tax_strategies | tax evasion]] in a Calgary court, which carried an additional one-year jail penalty and a $106,000 fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

In total, Quasney was sentenced to 5.5 years behind bars and accumulated $775,000 in fines, a sum far exceeding his illicit gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Beyond the legal penalties, his CPA designation was suspended, his professional reputation was ruined, and he now carries a criminal record for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Lessons from the Quasney Case

Quasney's story is a cautionary tale for anyone contemplating defrauding the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:

*   **Taxable Income**: All income, even stolen money, is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]] expects every dollar earned to be reported, regardless of its source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Unreported stolen money creates discrepancies in the [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]] system, serving as a red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Corporate Fraud Detection**: Corporate fraud seldom goes unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Significant financial discrepancies can trigger red flags, and audits can uncover the truth, even years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Severe Consequences**: [[avoiding_tax_evasion_and_aggressive_tax_strategies | Tax evasion]] and fraud carry heavy consequences, including massive fines, loss of career, and prison time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **The [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]] Always Wins**: Quasney likely believed he could evade capture, but his case demonstrates that when it comes to fraud, the "house" – in this case, the [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA]] – will always prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Quasney's downfall underscores the importance of a strong ethical background, particularly in positions of financial power, due to the inherent temptations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For those interested in legal [[preventing_tax_fraud_and_legal_tax_planning_strategies | tax planning]] strategies, it's possible to save taxes without resorting to illegal activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

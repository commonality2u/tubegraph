The two-tier Canada Pension Plan (CPP) system, also known as [[cpp_enhancements_and_contribution_updates_in_2025 | CPP enhancement]], is being introduced in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This new system requires higher earners to [[importance_of_salary_and_contributions_for_cpp | contribute more]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

This [[cpp_new_contribution_levels_and_implications | new system helps higher earners save more for retirement]] by potentially increasing CPP replacement of lifetime earnings from 25% to up to 33.33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

## First Tier (BCPP)

The first tier, known as BCPP, applies to earnings up to $71,500, which is referred to as the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

*   **Employee Contribution:** 5.95% of eligible earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Contribution:** 5.95% of eligible earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Self-employed Contribution:** 11.9% (combining both employee and employer rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Enhanced CPP (CPP2)

The enhanced CPP, known as CPP2, applies to earnings between $71,300 and $81,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

*   **Employee Contribution:** 4% of eligible earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Employer Contribution:** 4% of eligible earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Self-employed Contribution:** 8% (combining both employee and employer rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## Contribution Caps

Total contributions for 2025 are capped at $4,420 for incomes exceeding $81,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Example Contribution Rates by Income Level (2025)

The calculations for CPP contributions include a $3,500 exemption from every calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

*   **$40,000 Annual Income:** An employee would pay $2,171 in CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This income level does not reach the second tier (CPP2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **$80,000 Annual Income:** An employee would pay a total of $4,388, which includes $348 from the CPP2 tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **$100,000 Annual Income:** An individual at this income level would have already capped out the maximum CPP contribution at $4,420 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

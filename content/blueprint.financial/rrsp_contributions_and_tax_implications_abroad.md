When planning to permanently leave Canada, understanding how your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is affected is crucial for financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Contributions and Withdrawals

As a non-resident of Canada, you can still contribute to your RRSP if you have available contribution room from Canadian-earned income, even if you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. However, without Canadian income, you will not generate new contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Any withdrawals you make as a non-resident are generally subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This rate, part of the [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax implications of RRSP withdrawals]], can be reduced if Canada has a tax treaty with your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For example, the tax treaty between Canada and the US can reduce the withholding tax rate on periodic RRSP withdrawals to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Tax Implications

Your RRSP investments will continue to grow tax-deferred in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, your new country of residence might tax the income or gains within your RRSP, depending on their tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This varies from country to country, and some tax treaties may offer tax relief or exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For instance, the US generally does not tax the incoming gains within your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Canada has tax treaties with 91 countries, including common ones like the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Managing Your RRSP Abroad

You can keep your RRSP account open and continue to manage your investments even as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It's important to be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees if you plan to withdraw funds, as these can impact your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Converting to a RRIF

As a non-resident, you can also convert your RRSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Withdrawals from a RRIF will have similar withholding tax rules, typically 25%, unless a tax treaty reduces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Minimum withdrawals from your RRIF are based on your age and the fund's value, just as they would be if you lived in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This conversion is part of [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_to_rrif_conversion | tax implications of RRSP to RRIF conversion]].

## Returning to Canada

If you decide to return to Canada, you can resume contributing to your RRSP based on any new Canadian income you generate and its associated contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Pro Tip

A common question is about the best ways to withdraw from your RRSP after retirement, which is covered in detail in other resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This falls under [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP withdrawal planning in retirement]]. If you are married or in a common-law relationship, exploring [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | RRSP income splitting for tax efficiency]] can help reduce overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

For specific details and implications related to your situation, it is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional in both Canada and your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Understanding the [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025 pension updates]] for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is crucial for retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These updates aim to help maximize benefits and save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Payment Dates in 2025

The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]], [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]], and [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]] in [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]], meaning all three benefits will be received on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Payments are typically made in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

For convenience, direct deposit can be set up through the My Service Canada account, ensuring timely, safer, and more reliable delivery of funds compared to mail checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] Updates for [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]]

### [[CPP cost of living increase 2025 | Cost of Living Adjustment]]

[[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] payments are adjusted annually to match [[CPP and inflation adjustments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]], the adjustment is 2.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This means a monthly [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] payment of $1,000 in 2024 would increase by $26 to $1,026 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This adjustment helps retirees maintain purchasing power as costs rise, although it is noted as a small increase for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Two-Tier [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] System ([[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] Enhancement)

A two-tier [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] system, also known as [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] enhancement, requires higher earners to contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

*   **First Tier ([[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | BCPP]]):** Applies to earnings up to $71,500 (Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings - YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Employee contribution: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Employer contribution: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Self-employed contribution: 11.9% (combined employee and employer rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Enhanced [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP]] ([[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | CPP2]]):** Applies to earnings between $71,300 and $81,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Employee contribution: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Employer contribution: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Self-employed contribution: 8% (combined) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Contributions are capped at $4,420 for incomes exceeding $81,200 in [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. An exempt amount of $3,500 is excluded from calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. For example, an employee earning $40,000 would pay $2,171 in [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] (not reaching the second tier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. An income of $80,000 would incur a total of $4,388, including $348 from the second tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. At $100,000, the maximum [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] contribution of $4,420 for [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]] is capped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This new system enables higher earners to save more for retirement, with [[CPP and OAS updates | CPP]] replacing up to 33.33% of lifetime earnings, an increase from 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## [[CPP and OAS updates | Old Age Security (OAS)]] Updates for [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]]

### [[CPP and inflation adjustments | Cost of Living Adjustment]]

[[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] payments are reviewed quarterly to keep pace with [[CPP and inflation adjustments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For the January to March [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]] period, there will be no increase as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a small dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, over the past year, benefits have grown by 2%, helping seniors keep pace with rising living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] Clawback Threshold Update

The [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] pension recovery tax, or clawback, requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] benefits if their net income surpasses a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For July 2024 to June 2025, this threshold is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Seniors with net income exceeding this amount must repay 15% of the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For instance, a net income of $100,000 would result in a repayment of approximately $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Strategies like income splitting or utilizing a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can help keep net income below the threshold to minimize the clawback's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Increased [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] Pension at Age 75

Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] payments, a measure introduced in July 2022 to address financial challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. For the January to March [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]] quarter:

*   Ages 65 to 74: Maximum monthly [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] payment is $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Ages 75 and older: Maximum monthly [[CPP and OAS updates | OAS]] payment increases to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] Updates for [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]]

The [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]] provides financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Keeping up with the Cost of Living

[[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]] payments also adjust quarterly to match changes in the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. For January to March [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]], the maximum monthly [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]] payment for a single senior remains at $1,086 due to no CPI increase in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. However, [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]] benefits have grown by 2% over the past year (January 2024 to January 2025), helping seniors keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Updated Income Thresholds for [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]]

Eligibility for [[GIS income thresholds and benefit updates in 2025 | GIS]] depends on income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For the first quarter of [[CPP and OAS updates | 2025]], the annual income limit for a single person is $22,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

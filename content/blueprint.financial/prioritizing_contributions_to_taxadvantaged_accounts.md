Prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts is crucial for financial success. These accounts, such as the TFSA, FHSA, and RRSP, provide significant tax savings and the potential for compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58">[03:58]</a>. Contributing early in the year allows investments more time to grow, aiding in wealth building for home purchases or retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08">[04:08]</a>.

## How to Prioritize

### TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)
For your [[maximizing_tfsa_for_taxfree_growth_and_retirement | TFSA]], aim to maximize your contribution room, which is $7,000 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>. Its tax-free growth feature makes it a powerful tool for wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>.

### FHSA (First Home Savings Account)
The FHSA is ideal for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23">[04:23]</a>. It offers tax deductions similar to an RRSP and tax-free withdrawals for a home purchase, much like a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26">[04:26]</a>.

### RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)
For your [[effective_rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP]], you can decide whether to contribute for the previous year or wait for the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>. This account is perfect for high-income earners who anticipate a [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burden_in_retirement | lower tax bracket in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>. Be aware of contribution limits and the March 3rd deadline for RRSP contributions for the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>.

### RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)
If you have children, regular contributions to an RESP can maximize government grants, up to $500 annually per child, providing tax-sheltered growth for their education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51">[04:51]</a>.

### Prioritization Rule of Thumb
If you're unsure where to start, consider these guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>:
*   **High-income earners**: Prioritize [[effective_rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP]] contributions for tax benefits, especially if your employer offers matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04">[05:04]</a>.
*   **Moderate or low-income earners**: Focus on the [[maximizing_tfsa_for_taxfree_growth_and_retirement | TFSA]] for its flexibility and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12">[05:12]</a>.
*   **Saving for a home**: Utilize the FHSA for its distinct tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17">[05:17]</a>.

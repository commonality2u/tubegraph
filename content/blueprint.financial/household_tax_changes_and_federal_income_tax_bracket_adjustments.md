Canada is implementing several tax changes in 2025 designed to help Canadians maximize tax savings and keep more of their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These updates include adjustments for households, pensions, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Federal Income Tax Brackets

For 2025, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has adjusted [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal income tax brackets]] upwards by 2.7% to account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This adjustment is beneficial as it helps prevent "bracket creep," where inflation might push incomes into higher tax brackets without a real increase in purchasing power, leading to higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

*   **Impact of Adjustment**
    An individual earning $80,000 annually in 2024 would have paid $3,327 in federal tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. With the 2025 adjustments, the same income will result in $3,244 in federal tax, a reduction of $82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This provides a small saving to help keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

In 2025, the Basic Personal Amount (BPA) has increased to $16,128 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, up from $15,705 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This amount is reduced for taxpayers with net incomes above approximately $177,000 and is fully phased out for incomes over about $253,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs)

Changes to RESPs in 2025 include increased Educational Assistant Payment (EAP) withdrawal limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

*   **EAP Withdrawal Limits**
    *   For full-time students, the EAP withdrawal limit during the first 13 weeks of enrollment has increased from $5,000 to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   For part-time students, the limit has increased from $2,500 to $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    These adjustments allow students to access more funds earlier in their studies, helping to cover initial expenses like tuition and textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Annual EAP Threshold**
    The annual EAP threshold has also been updated slightly from $28,122 to $28,881 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## GST Holiday

The government has implemented a temporary freeze on sales taxes for essential goods from December 14, 2024, to February 15, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This initiative aims to provide short-term financial relief to consumers during the holiday season and into the new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Employment Insurance (EI) Premiums

In 2025, the EI premium rate for employees has slightly decreased to $1.64 per $100 of insurable earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, down from $1.66 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. For a worker earning $50,000 annually, this translates to annual savings of approximately $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Tax Credits

It is important to review annual updates to tax credits to maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Canada Child Benefit**
    The Canada Child Benefit has increased to almost $8,000 per child under six and about $6,700 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Medical Expense Tax Credit**
    The federal threshold for the medical expense tax credit has been updated, allowing claims for slightly more medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. A comprehensive list of eligible tax credits is available on the Government of Canada website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Pension and Retiree Tax Updates

### CPP Contributions

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) now features two levels of contributions with updated thresholds and rates for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Contribution Structure**
    *   **Regular CPP**: Applies to income up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE), which is now $71,200 (up from $68,500 in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Contributions are calculated after a $3,500 basic exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **CPP2**: Applies to additional earnings between the YMPE and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE), which is now $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Contribution Rates**
    *   **Regular CPP**: Remains at 5.95% for both employees and employers (11.9% combined) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   **CPP2**: Now 4% for both employees and employers (8% for self-employed individuals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Impact on Earners**
    *   For lower earners (below $71,200), there will be minimal or no changes in contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   For higher earners (up to $81,300), there will be notable increases due to CPP2 contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. For instance, someone earning $80,000 will pay over $500 more in CPP in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Why it Matters**
    These higher contributions lead to larger retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Although paying more now may seem burdensome, it is considered an investment in future retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS) Repayment Threshold

For the 2024 income year, the OAS repayment threshold is $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. If an individual's net income exceeds this amount, they will need to repay part or all of their OAS pension through a recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This repayment is calculated as 15% of the income exceeding the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The recovery tax period is from July 2025 to June 2026, based on 2024 income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

> [!example] Example OAS Repayment
> If your net income for 2024 is $100,000, your excess income above the threshold ($90,995) would be approximately $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The repayment amount, 15% of this excess, would be about $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This amount would be deducted monthly from your OAS payments during the specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Age Amount Credit

The age amount credit is a non-refundable tax credit for Canadians aged 65 and older, designed to reduce federal income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the maximum age amount is $9,288 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, increased from $8,790 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Full eligibility applies if net income is below $45,522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The credit is reduced by 15% of net income exceeding this threshold and is fully eliminated when net income reaches around $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

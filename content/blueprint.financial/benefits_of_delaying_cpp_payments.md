Delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits can be a strategic financial decision for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While starting CPP at age 60 is an option, there are several reasons why postponing payments could lead to a more secure and comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Reasons to Delay CPP Payments

### 1. Significantly Higher Monthly Payments
The most apparent advantage of [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying your CPP]] is the increased monthly benefit you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Starting at age 65 (Baseline):** For a baseline amount, an individual like Jennifer would receive $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Starting at age 60:** Payments are reduced by 0.6% per month, totaling a 36% reduction compared to age 65, resulting in only $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Delaying to age 70:** Benefits increase by 0.7% per month, leading to a 42% increase compared to age 65, amounting to $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
Delaying CPP to age 70 can significantly boost monthly benefits by more than double compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### 2. Sufficient Income or Savings
If you possess enough income or savings to cover your expenses between ages 60 and 70, delaying CPP is a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Utilizing retirement savings such as RRSPs, TFSAs, or workplace pensions allows your investments to continue growing while avoiding an early reduction in CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This strategy provides a substantial boost to retirement income once increased CPP payments begin at age 70, enhancing financial stability and providing higher guaranteed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### 3. Good Health and Longevity
For those in good health, delaying CPP past age 60 is a strong consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Life expectancy in Canada is higher than many realize; a 60-year-old today is expected to live to approximately 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Starting CPP early locks in a lower monthly amount for life, which might be insufficient later in life if you live longer than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Delaying hedges against the risk of outliving other retirement savings, as CPP payments last for the rest of your life once started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. For example, the break-even point for earning more by [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 4. Protection Against Inflation
CPP payments are indexed to inflation, meaning they increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For instance, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Delaying CPP allows for larger, inflation-indexed payments, offering a unique and valuable form of investment that few other market options provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### 5. Trust in CPP Management and Sustainability
Concerns about the CPP running out of money are common, but highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Growing Contributions:** CPP contributions are projected to significantly grow, with base CPP contributions expected to rise from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050, and additional CPP contributions from $9.3 billion to $45 billion in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Regular Reviews:** The CPP undergoes regular independent actuarial reviews, which have determined it is financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Strong Investment Returns:** The CPP Investment Portfolio has delivered decent long-term returns, with a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as of the 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### 6. Avoiding OAS Clawback
[[Tax implications of CPP | Tax implications of CPP]] and [[OAS clawback | OAS payments]] are important considerations. Old Age Security (OAS) payments can be substantial (up to $784 per month), but are subject to clawbacks if your income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. As of the latest figures, the OAS clawback starts if you earn more than $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If you anticipate your total retirement income, even with delayed and increased CPP, will remain below this threshold, delaying CPP can be beneficial as you'll receive larger CPP payments without losing OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### 7. Not Qualifying for Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is for low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. If you know your retirement income will be higher through other sources like RRSPs or work pensions, and you won't qualify for GIS anyway, then delaying CPP for larger payments makes sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Your higher income from delayed CPP won't impact a benefit you weren't eligible for in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 8. RSP Tax Planning
Delaying CPP can be part of a broader RSP tax planning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. You might choose to draw down your RRSP more quickly between ages 60 and 70 to minimize taxes upon death, leaving more money for your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. By covering living expenses from RRSP withdrawals in your early 60s, you reduce your RRSP balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Then, at age 70, your increased CPP benefits begin, reducing the amount you need to withdraw from other sources like remaining RRSPs, TFSAs, or work pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### 9. Still Working in Your 60s
Many Canadians are working later into their 60s and 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If you plan to continue working:
*   **Reduced Need for Early Income:** You likely won't need the CPP income immediately, making it easier to delay for additional payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Continued Contributions:** You must continue making CPP contributions from age 60 to 65 even if you start receiving benefits early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Superior Return:** The benefit from [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] will likely be greater than attempting to achieve similar returns by taking CPP early and investing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### 10. More Predictable and Stable Income
Delaying CPP means you might draw down on investments like RRSPs, TFSAs, or non-registered assets in your early retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. By doing so, you exchange uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Instead of relying on potentially fluctuating market returns, you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for the rest of your life starting at a later age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Conclusion
While the [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits | advantages of delaying CPP payments]] are significant, the [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments | optimal age to start CPP payments]] ultimately depends on your unique [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | personal financial situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. It's crucial to evaluate these factors carefully to make the best choice for your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

Managing capital gains and losses before the year-end can significantly reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This strategy is a key part of [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | planning tax-saving strategies]] and [[tips_to_legally_reduce_tax_liabilities | legally reducing tax liabilities]].

## Tax Loss Harvesting

If you have realized capital gains earlier in the year, consider realizing capital losses by selling underperforming investments to offset those gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This strategy, known as [[tax_loss_harvesting_strategy | tax loss harvesting]], helps reduce taxable income and can aid in rebalancing your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

*   **Example**: If you made $10,000 in capital gains from a property sale, and then sell another asset at a $4,000 loss before year-end, your taxable gain decreases to $6,000, resulting in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Consideration**: While effective for tax purposes, selling decisions should not be based solely on this factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Delaying Capital Gains

Another strategy for managing capital gains is to delay the sale of profitable investments until January or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This defers tax payments to the following year, providing extra time for cash flow management and allowing your money to accumulate further interest or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

*   **Example**: Selling a stock for a $15,000 gain in January 2025 pushes the associated tax payment into 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Complex Scenarios and Important Factors

Capital gains and losses planning can become complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

*   **Loss Carry Forward/Backward**: Capital losses can often be carried forward or backward to offset gains in other years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Income Variation**: The impact of capital gains and losses can vary significantly if your income fluctuates year to year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **New Inclusion Rules**: Depending on the size of your assets, it's crucial to factor in the new [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains inclusion rules]] of 66.7% on capital gains exceeding $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These rules are part of broader [[investment_strategies_to_address_increased_capital_gains_inclusion_rate | investment strategies to address increased capital gains inclusion rate]] considerations.
*   **Retiree Considerations**: Retirees should manage capital gains carefully to avoid triggering OAS (Old Age Security) clawbacks and other recovery taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

This area of tax planning requires careful consideration, especially for business clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

A Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) is a crucial component of retirement planning, serving as the exit ramp for managing withdrawals from your [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Understanding how to manage RRIF withdrawals effectively can lead to significant tax savings and a more reliable retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Converting Your RRSP to a RRIF

Converting your [[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_structured_withdrawals | RRSP to a RRIF]] is a mandatory step in retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
You must convert your [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] by December 31st of the year you turn 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Missing the Deadline
> If you miss this deadline, the CRA will consider your entire [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] balance as taxable income for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This could push you into the highest marginal tax bracket, potentially resulting in taxes of 50% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
>
> For example, if Emma turns 71 on June 15, 2025, with a $500,000 [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]], she must convert it to a RRIF by December 31, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Missing this could lead to a tax bill of $250,000, assuming a 50% marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Mandatory RRIF Withdrawals

Once your RRIF is set up, withdrawals are mandatory starting in the year you turn 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The government mandates a minimum withdrawal percentage based on your age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

| Age | Minimum Withdrawal Percentage |
| :-- | :---------------------------- |
| 72  | 5.4%                          |
| 95  | 20%                           |

At age 72, the minimum withdrawal is 5.4% of the RRIF's value, gradually increasing each year to 20% by age 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For instance, if Thea's RRIF is valued at $500,000 on December 31, 2025, she must withdraw a minimum of 5.4% ($27,000) in 2026, the year she turns 72 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Basic RRIF Tax Minimization Strategies

Several fundamental strategies can help reduce your RRIF tax burden:

### Pension Income Tax Credit
RRIF withdrawals allow access to the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Canadians age 65 and older can claim a deduction on up to $2,000 of eligible pension income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This credit directly reduces the income tax owed on that portion of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [[rrsp_flexibility_and_withdrawal_challenges | RRSP withdrawals]] do not qualify for this credit, but RRIF withdrawals do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

For example, Leila, 65, converts $40,000 of her $200,000 [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] into a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. By withdrawing $2,000 annually from the RRIF, she claims the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Assuming a 30% marginal tax rate, this saves her $600 annually in taxes ($2,000 x 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Over five years, she withdraws $10,000 tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Avoiding OAS Clawbacks
Large RRIF withdrawals can push your income above the OAS clawback threshold (around $90,000 as of 2024), reducing your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Coordinating withdrawals with tax-free income sources like the [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. David, 72, withdraws $20,000 annually from his RRIF and supplements his income with [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] withdrawals, keeping his taxable income below the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Minimize Fees
Unlike direct [[rrsp_flexibility_and_withdrawal_challenges | RRSP withdrawals]], which often incur fees ($50-$150 per withdrawal) from financial institutions, RRIF withdrawals typically do not have these additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Using a Younger Spouse's Age
You can leverage a younger spouse's age to calculate the mandatory minimum RRIF withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This lowers the required withdrawal percentage, preserving more funds in your RRIF for tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. For example, Emma, 72, with a $1 million RRIF, would normally withdraw 5.4% ($54,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. If her spouse Alex is 65, she can use his age to reduce her mandatory withdrawal to 4% ($40,000), lowering her taxable income by $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### Understanding Withholding Taxes
[[withholding_tax_on_rrsp_withdrawals | Withholding taxes]] on RRIF withdrawals are like a prepayment towards your annual income tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. They are reconciled when you file your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Points on Withholding Taxes
> *   Mandatory minimum RRIF withdrawals are **not** subject to [[withholding_tax_on_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
> *   Withdrawals above the minimum are subject to [[withholding_tax_on_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] based on the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>:
    *   Up to $5,000: 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
    *   $5,000.01 to $15,000: 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>
    *   Above $15,000: 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>

For example, Jon, 72, with a $400,000 RRIF, must withdraw $21,600 (5.4% minimum) in 2026, which is not subject to [[withholding_tax_on_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. If he withdraws an additional $10,000, that extra amount is subject to a 20% [[withholding_tax_on_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] ($2,000 withheld) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Advanced RRIF Tax Strategies

More sophisticated strategies can further reduce taxes, maintain steady income, and preserve wealth.

### Using RRIF as a Bridge Fund to Delay CPP and OAS
A common strategy is to use RRIF withdrawals to fund early retirement, allowing you to delay collecting Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits for higher future amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Delaying CPP to age 70 increases benefits by 42% compared to age 65, and OAS increases by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

For instance, Michael, 60, retires with a $400,000 [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. He converts $200,000 to a RRIF and withdraws $20,000 annually until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. At 70, his CPP increases from $1,200 to $1,704 per month, and his OAS rises from $700 to $952 per month (compared to starting at 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### RRIF Meltdown Strategy
This strategy involves gradually reducing your RRIF balance by reinvesting withdrawals into tax-efficient accounts, such as your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The aim is to spread taxable income over many years, avoiding large tax hits in high-income years or at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. David, 70, with a $500,000 RRIF, withdraws $40,000 annually, allocating $20,000 to his [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] and $20,000 for living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This reduces his RRIF balance and thus the taxable amount left to his estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### RRIF Income Splitting for Couples
RRIF withdrawals can be split with a spouse to reduce overall household taxes, especially if one spouse has a significantly lower income tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Both partners can also claim the $2,000 [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]], effectively doubling the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Mark withdraws $10,000 annually from his RRIF and allocates $5,000 to his wife Susan, who earns less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Their combined taxable income decreases, and both claim the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]], saving $1,200 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Partial RRSP to RRIF Conversions
[[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_structured_withdrawals | Converting smaller amounts of your RRSP to a RRIF]] before age 71 spreads taxable income over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This also allows you to start benefiting from features like the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]] as early as age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Sophia, 65, with a $300,000 [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]], partially converts $50,000 annually to a RRIF for six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. By withdrawing $2,000 yearly, she maximizes the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]], saving up to $600 annually, while the remaining [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] funds continue to grow tax-deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Estate Planning for RRIFs

Planning your RRIF as part of your estate can significantly reduce [[rrif_estate_planning_and_charitable_giving | taxes and ensure beneficiaries receive maximum benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### Spousal Rollovers
If your spouse or common-law partner is the designated beneficiary, the RRIF balance can roll over tax-deferred to their [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] or RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This avoids immediate taxation and preserves funds for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Non-Spousal Beneficiaries
When the beneficiary is not a spouse, the RRIF balance is fully taxed as income in the year of your death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Proper planning can help mitigate this impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Tom has a $400,000 RRIF, and if his adult child is the beneficiary, his estate could face over $200,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. By starting withdrawals earlier and spreading them out, he could reduce the RRIF balance and subsequent tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Using Life Insurance
A strategy to cover potential taxes on RRIF at death is to use life insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. You can withdraw from your RRIF over the years to pay for the life insurance policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Charitable Giving
Naming a charity as a beneficiary of your RRIF is a tax-smart way to leave a legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The donation generates a tax credit that can offset the taxes owed on the RRIF balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Benefits include reduced estate taxes, bypassing probate fees, and supporting a meaningful cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Pro Tips for Managing RRIF Accounts

*   **Consider Early [[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_structured_withdrawals | RRSP to RRIF Conversions]]**: Converting partial small amounts before age 71 allows you to claim the $2,000 [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income tax credit]] starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Consolidate RRIF Accounts**: Combining multiple RRIFs simplifies administration, reduces fees, and ensures mandatory withdrawals are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Use RRIF Calculators**: Online calculators can project withdrawals, estimate taxes, and show how different rates impact savings, giving you better control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Use In-Kind Transfers**: Instead of selling investments, you can transfer them from your [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP]] to your RRIF in kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This preserves growth potential, avoids transaction fees, and maintains your investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **Coordinate RRIF Withdrawals with Other Income**: Balance RRIF withdrawals with CPP, OAS, [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSAs]], and other accounts to manage taxes and prevent OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. A mix of taxable and tax-free income maximizes after-tax retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Smart RRIF management is key to retaining more of your money in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. With the right strategies, you can reduce taxes, extend the life of your savings, and enjoy financial peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

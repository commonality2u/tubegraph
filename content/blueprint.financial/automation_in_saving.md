Many believe that building wealth requires immense discipline and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. However, those who build significant Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) understand a key truth: you can "trick yourself into saving more without even noticing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The secret lies in automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Strategies for Effortless Saving through Automation

RSP millionaires employ several strategies to automate their savings, making the process consistent and effective:

*   **Pre-authorized Contributions** Setting up pre-authorized RSP contributions ensures money is transferred automatically on payday, preventing the opportunity to spend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This aligns with principles of [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | setting and automating clear financial goals]].
*   **Automatic Annual Contribution Increases** Many individuals set up an automatic 1% increase in contributions annually, allowing savings to grow effortlessly over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting Tax Refunds** Instead of spending RSP tax refunds on vacations or gadgets, RSP millionaires reinvest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This strategy can add hundreds of thousands to portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This is a key part of [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | planning tax-saving strategies]].
*   **Maximizing "Free Money"**
    *   **Employer RSP Matching** They always take full advantage of employer RSP matching programs, ensuring they don't leave free money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   **Spousal RSPs** Utilizing spousal RSPs helps balance taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   **Deduction Carry-Forwards** They claim deduction carry-forwards when it offers the most tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Why Automation Works

Automation effectively removes human error from the saving equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Consider two individuals:
*   **James**, who attempts to save manually, often forgets to transfer money to his RSP or finds he needs the funds for other expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Sophie**, who automates all her RSP contributions, ensures they occur without her intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Over time, Sophie becomes significantly wealthier than James, not due to higher earnings, but because her automated approach eliminates the inconsistencies and missed opportunities common with manual saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

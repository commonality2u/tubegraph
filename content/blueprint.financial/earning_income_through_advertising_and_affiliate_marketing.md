The financial blog "Wealth Awesome" began in 2019 with a goal of earning $3,000 a month and attracting 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This goal was significantly surpassed, with the site earning almost 10 times the initial income target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The website generated over $500,000 in income, excluding its eventual sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

The primary income streams for Wealth Awesome were advertising and affiliate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## How Wealth Awesome Earned Income

### Advertising on the Site
Once a website reaches a certain traffic threshold, it can apply to premium ad networks that connect advertisers with the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

*   **Mediavine Partnership**: After reaching 50,000 visitors per month, Wealth Awesome applied to Mediavine, an ad network that has since lowered its requirement to 10,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Revenue Per Mille (RPM)**: Ad networks pay based on RPM, which is the amount earned per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For finance content with Mediavine, RPMs were notably high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This meant 10,000 visitors could generate approximately $500 USD (or nearly $700 CAD) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Affiliate Commissions
Affiliate commissions involve earning money for recommending and referring certain products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

*   **Product Selection**: The site only chose to recommend products that were genuinely believed in and personally used, such as Well Simple, Questrade, and EQ Bank, which became top affiliate partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **How it Works**: An example provided is an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms. The article included links to recommended products, and if someone signed up through these links, a commission would be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Commission Amounts**: Commissions typically ranged from $50 to $100, with some affiliate partners paying even more, like $150 or $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This model created a "win-win scenario," where users signed up for valuable products and the site earned for the referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Growth and Success of Wealth Awesome

*   **Financial Milestones**: The first dollar earned from the site was a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade in November 2020, about a year after the site's launch and after writing over 150 articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The initial goal of $3,000 per month was reached in February 2021, approximately 1.5 years after starting the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. At its peak, the site earned over $20,000 a month, almost reaching $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Traffic Growth**: Traffic started slow, gaining traction around 11 months in with about 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. By January 2021, traffic had increased tenfold to 50,000 visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The site peaked at around 250,000 visitors per month in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. In total, the site attracted about 5 million visitors over the years, a significant number for a Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## The Motivation Behind Wealth Awesome

The creator's desire to become a digital nomad, able to travel and work remotely, was a key motivator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Having previously backpacked around Asia, the dream was to build a life with similar freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Additionally, there was a strong desire to create something positive that would help educate Canadians and provide a sense of purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Before starting Wealth Awesome, the creator wrote for Canadian media and investment publications like CTV News, building a following of tens of thousands of readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A friend suggested starting a personal financial education site, leading to the realization that the content could be as good or better than existing Canadian financial blogs, given the creator's education and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This identified market opportunity, combined with a love for writing and the desire to share the digital nomad journey, led to the launch of Wealth Awesome in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Lessons Learned and Future Endeavors

The experience of creating and managing Wealth Awesome provided significant learning opportunities, including technical skills like website design, SEO, graphic creation, data analysis, and managing an affiliate partner network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Previous experience in analysis, B2B sales, and as a financial advisor also contributed to the site's growth and content quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. A crucial personal lesson was developing mental toughness to manage the ups and downs of running a business, understanding that not everything can be controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The timing of the site's launch just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people were online learning about personal finance, was also seen as a stroke of luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

The site was eventually sold due to a loss of passion for [[starting_and_growing_a_finance_blog | blogging]] after several years and uncertainty about the future of blogging with advancements in AI, the shift to video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The sale was made to a trusted friend who previously worked with the creator at CI Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The creator is now focusing on a new business, a [[transitioning_from_blogging_to_a_financial_planning_company | financial planning company]] called Blueprint Financial, which aims to build customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This new venture aligns with the passion for helping people optimize their finances and providing peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

When planning to permanently leave Canada, it is crucial to manage your finances carefully to avoid potential losses. Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is one of the financial instruments affected by a change in residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article assumes you have decided to become a permanent non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## TFSA Status for Non-Residents

Upon becoming a non-resident of Canada, your TFSA undergoes several important changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### The Good News

*   **Maintains Tax-Free Status in Canada**: Your TFSA maintains its tax-free status in Canada, even if you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **[[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_withdrawals | Withdrawals]]**: You can still withdraw funds from your TFSA while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These withdrawals are added back to your contribution room, but this room cannot be used again until you become a resident of Canada again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For more information on [[proper_strategies_for_tfsa_withdrawals | proper strategies for TFSA withdrawals]], consult relevant resources.
*   **Repatriation**: If you decide to return to Canada as a resident, you can resume normal TFSA activities, including making contributions up to your available room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### The Bad News

*   **No New Contributions**: As a non-resident, you cannot make new contributions to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, your existing TFSA can remain open and continue to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Contributing While Non-Resident**: Contributing to your TFSA while a non-resident can result in hefty penalties of 1% per month on the contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For instance, contributing $5,000 as a non-resident could incur a $50 per month penalty, totaling $600 over a year, significantly reducing investment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **No New Contribution Room Accumulation**: You do not accumulate new TFSA contribution room for any years during which you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Tax Implications Abroad

While the growth within your TFSA remains tax-free in Canada, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains from your TFSA according to its own tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

*   **Example: Moving to the US**: The United States does not recognize the TFSA, so the IRS will tax all income and gains from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. In this scenario, it might be advisable to collapse the account before moving to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Importance of Local Tax Rules**: It is crucial to be aware of the tax rules of the country you are moving to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Understanding the [[tax_efficient_strategies_for_withdrawing_from_a_tfsa | tax efficient strategies for withdrawing from a TFSA]] and avoiding [[red_flags_to_avoid_with_tfsa | red flags to avoid with TFSA]] is key.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip for your TFSA
> Before leaving Canada, consider maximizing your TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This allows your investments to continue growing tax-free while you are abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, as you cannot contribute more once you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

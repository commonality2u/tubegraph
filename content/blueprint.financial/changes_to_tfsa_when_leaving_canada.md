When planning to leave Canada permanently, managing your finances carefully is crucial to avoid potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This guide outlines how your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is affected when you become a permanent non-resident of Canada and move abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>.

## TFSA Account Status

When you leave Canada, your TFSA is subject to several important changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### The Good News

*   **Tax-Free Status** Your TFSA maintains its tax-free status in Canada even if you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals** You can still withdraw funds from your TFSA while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. These withdrawals are added back to your contribution room, but you cannot use this room again until you become a resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.
*   **Repatriation** If you decide to return to Canada as a resident, you can resume normal TFSA activities, including making contributions up to your available room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### The Bad News

*   **No New Contributions** You cannot make new contributions to your TFSA while you are a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. However, your existing TFSA can remain open and continue to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Penalties for Non-Resident Contributions** If you contribute to your TFSA as a non-resident, you may face hefty penalties of 1% per month on the contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
    *   For example, contributing $5,000 to your TFSA while being a non-resident could incur a penalty of $50 per month until the amount is withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Over a year, this penalty could add up to $600, significantly reducing investment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
    *   For more information on penalties, see [[Penalties for Overcontributing to a TFSA]].
*   **Contribution Room** You do not accumulate new TFSA contribution room for any years during which you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Tax Implications Abroad

While the growth within the TFSA remains tax-free in Canada, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains from your TFSA according to its tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

> [!example]
> If you move to the United States, the IRS does not recognize the TFSA and will tax all incoming gains from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Due to this, it might be advisable to collapse the TFSA account before moving to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

It is crucial to be aware of the tax rules of the country you are moving to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

> [!tip] Pro Tip for Your TFSA Before Leaving
> Max out your TFSA contribution before you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This allows your investments to continue growing tax-free while you are abroad, and you cannot contribute more once you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

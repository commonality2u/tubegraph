The amount of Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefit a Canadian receives is significantly influenced by their contribution history, not solely by high earnings or the age at which they begin collecting benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Most Canadians do not receive the maximum CPP payment of around $2,034 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

CPP payouts are based on an individual's lifetime contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. To achieve the maximum CPP payout, a person generally needs to have at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Contribution Gaps: Why Even High Earners Can Fall Short

Even individuals with high salaries who delay collecting CPP until age 70 may not receive the full maximum benefit if they have gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The vast majority of Canadians do not receive the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Common Reasons for Contribution Gaps

Several situations can lead to gaps in an individual's CPP contribution history:
*   **Career Breaks** Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care can result in years with no CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While the child rearing provision can offer some help, many people still experience gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership** If self-employed, an individual might have paid lower CPP contributions or not contributed consistently, which can reduce their lifetime average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment** Being unemployed for several years, even if followed by a high-salary job, can cause those missing years to lower the overall average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry** Retiring before age 65 or starting work later in life can prevent an individual from accumulating the necessary 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

For instance, Elaine received the full $2,034 per month at age 70 because she had 39 years of maximum contributions with no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. In contrast, Jerry, who also delayed CPP to age 70 and was a high-income earner, received less than $1,500 because he had numerous contribution gaps due to reasons like taking time off for a business, returning to school, or unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## How Contribution Gaps Affect Your Final CPP Payout

CPP calculates retirement benefits based on an individual's best 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. To account for periods where people may not work consistently, CPP includes a general dropout provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **General Dropout Provision** This provision allows individuals to exclude up to 17% of their lowest earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Since CPP considers 47 years of potential contributions from ages 18 to 65, this means approximately 8 years of low or zero contributions can be dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If an individual delays CPP to age 70, their total working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains around 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Impact of Extended Gaps** While the dropout provision helps mitigate the effect of short gaps, if an individual misses more than 8 years of contributions, their final payout will be lower, even if they had high earnings and delayed collecting CPP to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This is what happened to Jerry; despite a high income and delayed CPP, his significant contribution gaps reduced his payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

The amount of CPP benefit received depends on three factors: salary, timing of collection, and consistency of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize Your Contribution Years

To optimize CPP payouts, individuals should aim to maximize all three factors, including consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

*   **Avoid Contribution Gaps** Work for at least 39 years with strong contributions to avoid lowering your average payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Missing more than the allowable 8 years of low or no contributions will reduce benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Utilize the Child Rearing Provision** If time was taken off to raise children under the age of seven, use the child rearing provision to exclude those low-income years from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Maximizing CPP involves making smart decisions about one's career and financial planning, not just earning more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

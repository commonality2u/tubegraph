Canadians are advised to optimize their savings accounts to avoid financial pitfalls and unlock government grants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Among the options, the Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) and Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) offer unique advantages, especially due to their significant government contributions. These accounts should be prioritized even before the TFSA or FHSA due to the "free money" advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP)

The RDSP is designed for long-term disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It offers substantial government grants and bonds to support Canadians with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

*   **Canada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG)**: This grant matches contributions at a high rate. It matches 300% on the first $500 contributed and 200% on the next $1,000, allowing for up to $3,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Canada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB)**: This bond provides up to $1,000 annually without requiring any contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

**Example**: If you contribute $1,500 to an RDSP, you could receive up to $3,500 from the CDSG and an additional $1,000 from the CDSB, totaling $4,500 in free government support each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This makes the RDSP a powerful tool for building financial security for individuals with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Prioritization
The RDSP should be prioritized first if you qualify, due to its very generous government grants for disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. In the overall order of investment priority, it comes before other accounts like FHSA, TFSA, and [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

## Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)

RESPs assist families in saving for post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

*   **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)**: The CESG matches 20% of contributions, up to $500 per year per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The lifetime maximum for the CESG is $7,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Contributing $2,500 annually will secure a $500 grant from the CESG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This grant automatically translates into an easy 20% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Canada Learning Bond (CLB)**: Lower-income families can also benefit from the CLB, which adds up to $2,000 without requiring contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Compounding**: Starting early with an RESP maximizes investment growth, especially when combined with compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Prioritization
The RESP is recommended third in the priority list for accounts with "free money" advantages, after the RDSP and [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. It provides a 20% government match for education savings up to $500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Additionally, RESPs can act as a form of [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

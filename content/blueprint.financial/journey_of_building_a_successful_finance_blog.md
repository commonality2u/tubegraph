The website Wealth Awesome.com was launched in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> with an initial financial goal of earning $3,000 a month and reaching 30,000 readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These goals were significantly exceeded, by almost 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Why Start Wealth Awesome?

Several motivations led to the creation of Wealth Awesome:
*   **Digital Nomad Dream** The creator's long-standing dream was to become a digital nomad, someone with an online income source that allows for remote work and world travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Having previously backpacked around Asia in their teens and early 20s, they loved the adventure and freedom of that lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Purpose and Impact** A strong desire to create something that was a "net positive in the world," specifically to educate Canadians about finance and help people, provided a sense of purpose and joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Experience** The creator began by writing for Canadian media and investment publications on finance topics, and still writes for outlets like CTV News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This led to a substantial following, with tens of thousands of readers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity** A friend suggested starting their own financial education site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Upon reviewing existing Canadian financial blogs, the creator felt confident they could produce content of equal or higher quality, leveraging their education and experience in the Canadian financial industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Love for Writing** Combined with the market opportunity and the desire to share their digital nomad journey, a genuine love for writing prompted the decision to launch the site in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Blog Growth and Income Generation

Building income from the blog was not an immediate process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **First Earnings** The first dollar was earned about a year after launch, in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This was a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade, after writing over 150 articles and dedicating hundreds of hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Financial Milestones** The initial goal of $3,000 per month was reached in February 2021, approximately a year and a half after the site started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Peak earnings reached over $20,000 a month, almost hitting $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. In total, the website generated over $500,000, excluding the undisclosed sale price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Income Streams

Income was primarily generated through:
*   **Advertising** Once a website hits a certain traffic threshold (formerly 50,000 visitors per month, now 10,000), it can apply for premium ad networks like Mediavine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These networks pay based on RPM (revenue per mille/thousand visitors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Finance content yielded high RPMs, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This meant 10,000 visitors could generate around $500 US (or nearly $700 CAD) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions** This involves earning money by recommending products and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Only products personally believed in and used, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank, were promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. For example, an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms included links, and commissions ranging from $50 to $100 (or even $150-$200 for some partners) were earned if someone signed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Traffic Growth

The site's traffic started slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Initial Traction** After writing about 100 articles and 11 months into the journey, the site started seeing traction, reaching about 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Rapid Expansion** Traffic increased tenfold by January 2021, reaching 50,000 visitors monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Peak and Total Visitors** The site peaked at around 250,000 visitors per month during its height in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. In total, approximately 5 million visitors came to the site over the years, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Associated YouTube Channel** A linked YouTube channel also grew to nearly 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## [[Challenges and lessons learned in blogging | Hard Lessons and Learnings]]

The experience provided valuable [[challenges_and_lessons_learned_in_blogging | lessons learned]]:
*   **Technical Skills** New technical skills were acquired, including website design and building, search engine optimization (SEO), content creation, graphics design, website data analysis, affiliate partner network building, website monetization, hiring and managing people, and using various online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience** Previous professional experience was instrumental:
    *   Analyst experience helped with SEO and outreach data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   Business-to-business (B2B) sales experience aided website promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   Financial advisor experience contributed to writing useful content and connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Personal Growth and Resilience** Running the business led to significant personal growth, particularly in managing the ups and downs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The creator learned to "ride out the bad results" and continue work, realizing that not everything can be controlled or fixed, even with best efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Developing mental toughness was deemed the most important lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck** Timing was recognized as key, with luck playing a role; starting the site right before COVID-19 meant more people were online and interested in personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

## [[Reasons for selling the blog and moving on | Why Sell the Site?]]

The decision to sell the blog was based on several factors:
*   **Loss of Passion** After several years, the creator found it increasingly difficult to stay motivated and excited about producing content for the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. A key lesson learned was to move on when the "fire" starts to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty in Blogging** Concerns about the future of blogging, due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates, created stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Random Sale Opportunity** The sale happened unexpectedly when a friend, Q (a former colleague from CI Investments who had just exited another online business), reached out expressing interest in adding Wealth Awesome to his portfolio of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The deal was finalized within a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The creator was pleased for the site to go to a trusted, smart friend who could bring fresh ideas and a new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## What's Next? [[starting_a_new_financial_planning_company | New Business Venture]]

The creator is now focused on a new business venture:
*   **Blueprint Financial** This new financial planning company aims to build customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Passion and Value** The new venture aligns with the creator's values and skills, driven by the belief that many people have not optimized their finances and that real value can be provided to Canadians and businesses nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The value of these plans was first tested on themselves and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Return to Financial Advising** This new role brings back the personal satisfaction of the one-on-one connection developed as a financial advisor in corporate life, which was their favorite previous job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Continued Content Creation** The creator plans to continue providing free and valuable personal finance content on their YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

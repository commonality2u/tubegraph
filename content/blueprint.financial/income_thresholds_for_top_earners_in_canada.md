This article breaks down the income levels required to be considered among the top 10%, 5%, and 1% of earners in Canada, based on 2022 data. The figures may be surprising, and comparisons to average Canadian incomes are also provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Top 10% Earners in Canada

As of 2022, to join the top 10% of individual income earners in Canada, an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Within this group:
*   The median income was $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   The average income was $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Key Trends and Insights

*   **Rising Entry Bar**: Between 2018 and 2022, the threshold to enter the top 10% rose by 14.3%, from $97,000 to approximately $111,000. This reflects higher overall income levels among Canada's top earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average**: By 2022, the average income for the top 10% was over $50,000 higher than the median income of $147,100. This gap indicates that a small number of ultra-high earners significantly influence the average, highlighting growing income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **[[economic_resilience_and_income_inequality_in_canada | Economic Resilience]]**: Despite major events like the COVID-19 pandemic, top earners continued to experience significant income growth, demonstrating that this segment remained relatively insulated from broader economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **[[economic_resilience_and_income_inequality_in_canada | Growing Inequality]]**: As both the median and average incomes within the top 10% increased faster than national income averages, the data suggests a continued widening of [[economic_resilience_and_income_inequality_in_canada | income inequality]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Life for a Top 10% Earner: David's Story

David, a 37-year-old engineer in Calgary's oil and gas industry, earns around $120,000 a year, placing him in the top 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He lives with his partner and two children in a comfortable, manageable three-bedroom home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The family drives a hybrid SUV and a used hatchback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. David is intentional with his finances, automating contributions to his Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. They take one quality vacation annually, such as a trip to a cabin in BC, Mexico, or the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. They can afford dining out, sports, and music lessons for their children, and handle unexpected expenses without stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Life in the top 10% is characterized by stability, flexibility, and quiet wins, rather than constant luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Top 5% Earners in Canada

To enter the top 5% of earners in Canada, an individual needed to earn at least $147,100 in total income as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Within this group:
*   The median income was $193,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The average income was $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Key Trends and Insights

*   **Steady Climb in Entry Threshold**: Between 2018 and 2022, the minimum income required to reach the top 5% increased by 16.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average**: The average income for the top 5% was over $75,000 more than the median, again indicating significant income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **High Tax Contribution**: The top 5% of earners paid an average of $87,700 in income taxes in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This group, despite representing only 1 in 20 taxpayers, contributed over 41% of all [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets | federal and provincial personal income taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Consistent Membership**: Approximately 76% of top 5% earners in 2022 were also in this group the previous year, and 86% had been in the top 5% at least once in the prior five years. This suggests that many high earners maintain their position at the top for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Life for a Top 5% Earner: Rachel's Story

Rachel, aged 45, earns $160,000 as a senior policy analyst with the federal government, placing her comfortably in Canada's top 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. She and her partner recently purchased a detached home in an Ottawa suburb, managing the mortgage with dual incomes and disciplined savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Their household operates smoothly with an SUV and a leased electric car through Rachel's work, allowing them to handle unforeseen expenses without stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. They consistently max out their RRSPs and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), contribute to their children's Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs), and invest additional funds in taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Their lifestyle includes significant freedom: their children attend private school with a focus on arts and languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They take international vacations every summer (e.g., France, Japan) and enjoy weekend getaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They dine out and purchase desired items without worry, all while maintaining financial security for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For Rachel, being in the top 5% provides peace of mind and freedom, rather than just luxury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Top 1% Earners in Canada

To reach the top 1% of earners in Canada, an individual needed to earn at least $283,200 in total income in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The median income rose by nearly 14.7%, while average incomes increased by 18.3%, outpacing both inflation and broader wage growth in Canada, suggesting that "the rich truly do get richer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Median vs. Average**: The average income for the top 1% was nearly $200,000 higher than the median. This substantial gap highlights how much income is concentrated among the ultra-elite, particularly the top 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Heavy Tax Contributions**: The top 1% of earners paid an average of $231,600 in income taxes in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Life for a Top 1% Earner: Mark's Story

Mark, aged 48, operates a successful marketing agency and earns over $350,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. He resides in Toronto's Leaside neighborhood with his partner and two children, owning a detached city home and a lakeside cottage in Muskoka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. His children attend private school and participate in competitive hockey, with a packed calendar of activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Mark occasionally flies business class using points to international destinations like Bali or Paris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

He maximizes his RRSPs, TFSAs, and RESPs, but the majority of his wealth is held within a holding company, invested in real estate, stocks, and private deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. His advisory team meets with him quarterly to manage his finances smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Mark also engages in philanthropy, donating to youth mental health causes and establishing a donor-advised fund to involve his children in giving back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. While his life offers significant freedom and options, it is not without demands; his schedule is busy, and his business requires high performance, while rising taxes keep his advisory team active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Comparison to Average Canadian Income

There is a stark contrast between the incomes of top earners and the average Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The [[average_income_in_canada_by_age | median income for Canadians by age group]] typically ranges from $35,000 to about $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

*   The highest median income, for the 45-54 age group, is $51,500, which is still $60,400 below the top 10% threshold of $111,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The top 5% threshold of $147,100 is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25-to-34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Income is just the start. It's what you do with it that builds freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Ronald Reed, a janitor from Vermont, for example, quietly accumulated an $8 million fortune through simple, consistent investing, despite not earning a high salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

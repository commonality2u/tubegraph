The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivorship pension provides financial support to the surviving spouse or common-law partner of a deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This pension can offer a crucial [[how_to_maximize_cpp_survivorship_pension_benefits | financial lifeline]] during a difficult time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the CPP survivorship pension, two key requirements must be met:

### Relationship Status
You must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### CPP Contributions
The deceased individual must have contributed to the CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or they must have contributed for a minimum of 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Application Process

The application for the survivorship pension is straightforward and involves completing the application on the Government of Canada's website and providing documents like the deceased spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Step-by-step guides are available to assist with the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

<h4>Don't Delay Your Application</h4>
Make sure to apply for the survivorship pension as soon as possible after your partner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond this period could result in lost funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It's easy to overlook this during the grieving process, but it's crucial to act quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

**Example of Delayed Application:**
If John passed away, and his wife Emma was eligible for $700 a month in CPP survivor benefits, waiting 18 months to apply would cause her to miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

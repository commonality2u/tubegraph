Many Canadians regret not properly planning their RRSP withdrawals in retirement, which can lead to increased taxes, a loss of government benefits, and mandatory withdrawals that may not align with their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:03">[07:01:03]</a>. While an RRSP refund might feel good initially, like a boomerang, the taxes on withdrawals will eventually come back to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Unexpected Tax on Withdrawals

Unlike TFSAs, every RRSP withdrawal is considered fully taxable income, which can significantly impact retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This can lead to [[impact_of_rsp_withdrawals_on_taxes | unexpected tax implications]] and a higher overall tax bill.

> For example, David earns $40,000 annually from CPP and a pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. If he withdraws $50,000 from his RRSP for home renovations, his taxable income would jump to $90,000, resulting in a much larger tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. He could have reduced this [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax burden]] by withdrawing smaller amounts over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.

## Forced Withdrawals at Age 71

By age 71, RRSPs must be converted into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), which mandates annual withdrawals regardless of whether the retiree needs the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This is akin to Cinderella's clock striking midnight, leading to mandatory withdrawals and tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

> Consider Michael, who has $500,000 in his RRSP at age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. Under current rules, he must withdraw approximately 5%, which amounts to $26,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. This increases his taxable income to $76,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. As he ages, higher withdrawal rates will force him to take out even more, compounding the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

## Losing OAS Benefits to RRSP Withdrawals

Old Age Security (OAS) benefits begin to be clawed back when income reaches around $91,000 (based on 2024 thresholds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Large [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RRSP withdrawals]] can push retirees over this threshold, leading to reduced or eliminated OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. Many regret not spreading out withdrawals earlier to avoid losing thousands in "free" government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

## Preventing Regrets

RRSPs can be a powerful financial tool, but only if used strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. To avoid these common [[rrsp_inflexibility_and_withdrawal_tax_consequences | RRSP inflexibility and withdrawal tax consequences]] and achieve a solid retirement plan, it's crucial to consider [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | tax-efficient RRSP withdrawal strategies]] and overall [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burden_in_retirement | strategies to minimize RRSP tax burden in retirement]].

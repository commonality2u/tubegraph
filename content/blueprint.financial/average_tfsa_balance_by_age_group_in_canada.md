This article explores the average Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) balances across different age groups in Canada, providing insights into how Canadians are utilizing this savings vehicle throughout their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding these averages can help individuals assess their own savings progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Average TFSA Savings by Age

TFSA balances generally increase with age, reflecting longer periods of contributions and compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Under 20:** The average TFSA balance for Canadians aged 18 to 19 is approximately $3,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This is notable given that individuals in this age group often have limited income from part-time jobs or allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **20 to 24:** The average balance rises to about $6,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. By this age, many individuals have a more stable income and begin making regular contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **25 to 29:** The average TFSA balance reaches about $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. During this period, individuals often gain financial stability, settle into careers, and start considering long-term financial goals like purchasing a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **30 to 34:** TFSA balances begin to accelerate, with an average of around $14,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **35 to 39:** The average balance further increases to approximately $15,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This age range typically involves focusing on major financial goals such as starting a family, buying property, or building an emergency fund, often leading to larger contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **40 to 44:** The average balance is approximately $17,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **45 to 49:** The average jumps to about $21,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This is often a peak earning period for Canadians, prompting increased contributions as retirement becomes a more immediate concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **50 to 54:** TFSA growth significantly increases, with an average balance of about $26,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **55 to 59:** The average balance jumps to about $33,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This is a critical time for Canadians to prepare seriously for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **60 to 64:** The average balance reaches close to $40,000, reflecting decades of compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **65 to 69:** The average balance reaches about $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Many Canadians utilize their TFSAs to cover retirement expenses without tax implications on withdrawals, making it a key component of their [[Role of TFSA in retirement planning | retirement strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Financial advisors often view the TFSA as a tool to control income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **70 to 74:** Average balances are approximately $49,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **75 to 79:** Balances climb further to almost $54,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **80 and Over:** The highest average balances are observed in this age group, at almost $56,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

It is notable that TFSA balances generally do not decrease, even in older age groups (65 and over), suggesting that on average, people do not draw down from their TFSAs in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This may not be optimal for [[Optimizing TFSA withdrawals in retirement | tax planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Important Considerations

It is important to remember that these figures represent *average* balances, which can be influenced by a few very large accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Median balances, which would more accurately reflect what a typical person has saved, were not available but would likely be lower than these averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Financial Planning

*   **Start Early to Maximize Compounding:** The earlier contributions begin, the greater the impact of compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Even a small balance in one's 20s can grow substantially over time with consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Plan for Retirement with TFSA:** TFSAs are not just for short-term savings; they are a valuable tax-free income source in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Building a TFSA for future financial security should be a long-term goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Reinvest Dividends and Interest:** To maximize tax-free growth, reinvest any dividends or interest earned directly back into the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

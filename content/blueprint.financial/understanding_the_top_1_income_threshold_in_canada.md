## The Top 1% Income in Canada

To understand what it means to be richer than 99% of Canadians, it's essential to define the income levels of the top 1%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>

According to Statistics Canada data from 2021:
*   The median income of the top 1% in Canada was $378,900 per year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   The threshold value (the minimum income required to be in the top 1%) was $271,600 per year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>
    *   The median income represents the middle point of the top 1% (effectively the top 0.5%), while the threshold is the bottom point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Crossing the $271,600 annual income threshold officially places you in the [[income_thresholds_to_reach_top_10_percent_5_percent_and_1_percent_in_canada | top 1% of income earners in Canada]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

Key characteristics of the top 1% income earners in 2021:
*   Approximately 80% were married or in common-law relationships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   Wages and salaries accounted for 63.1% of their income, a slight increase from 62.7% in 2017. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> This suggests about one-third of their income comes from sources outside their primary jobs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Being married or in a common-law relationship and diversifying income sources appear to be beneficial for reaching the top 1% income bracket. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>

## The Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

Net worth, defined as total assets minus liabilities, is considered a more accurate measure of being in the top 1% as it reflects accumulated wealth rather than just annual earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

According to a 2021 PBO report on [[household_net_worth_in_canada | household net worth in Canada]]:
*   The threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>
*   Approximately 160,000 families in Canada have achieved this mark, demonstrating it is an attainable goal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

## Four Ways to Join the Elite Group

Achieving top 1% status, both in income and net worth, typically involves a combination of strategies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> Here are four realistic approaches: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

### 1. Having a High-Paying Profession
Earning an annual income close to the top 1% threshold of $271,600 can significantly contribute to building substantial wealth over a career. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>

Professions that typically command such incomes include: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   C-suite level executives (CEO, CFO, CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Medical specialists (e.g., cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Partners in law firms and accounting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Investment bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Principal software engineers and senior data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Specialized dentists and senior software architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>

This path often requires many years of specialized education and work experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

### 2. Starting a Business
Business ownership is a primary way the top 1% accumulate wealth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>
*   Many of the richest Canadians built their fortunes by starting and scaling businesses, rather than through traditional 9-5 employment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>
*   Examples include media, retail, finance, and technology tycoons like Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Business ownership offers significant financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits (selling or going public). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   The key advantage of a business is its ability to scale, reaching hundreds, thousands, or millions of customers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>

Certain sales roles, such as real estate agents, mortgage brokers, or pharmaceutical sales representatives, can also achieve 1% income levels, acting as a hybrid between traditional salary and business ownership due to high commissions and bonuses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> Mark Cuban emphasizes that sales is crucial for any business to generate revenue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>

### 3. Investing Wisely
Even with a high income, effective investing is crucial to reach the top 1% net worth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> Investing allows money to compound and grow over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>

*   **Example**: Anne Scheiber, an IRS auditor, retired with modest savings but built a $22 million fortune by consistently investing in Blue Chip companies with solid dividends and holding them long-term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

*   **Strategies for beginners**:
    *   **Diversification**: Spreading investments across different asset classes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
    *   **Stock Market**: Investing in index funds or ETFs with low fees for a hands-off, diversified approach. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>
    *   **Individual Stocks**: For those more involved, learning to pick individual stocks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>
    *   **Fixed Income/Bonds**: Complementing stocks with bonds to reduce risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
    *   **Real Estate**: A significant and popular wealth builder for Canadians, providing steady income and property value appreciation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>

*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Utilize accounts like RRSPs, TFSAs, and FHSAs to enhance investment returns through [[tax_brackets_in_canada | tax benefits]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>
    *   **RRSP**: Contributions are tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
    *   **TFSA**: Investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

### 4. Being Frugal and Saving Most Income
Building substantial wealth is possible even with a low income by consistently saving and investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

*   **Example**: Ronald Read, a janitor and gas station attendant from Vermont, built an $8 million fortune by living frugally and consistently investing in Blue Chip stocks like Proctor and Gamble, JP Morgan Chase, and General Electric over several decades. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
*   This demonstrates the power of long-term investing combined with living below one's means and reinvesting dividends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
*   *Caution*: Avoid "extreme frugality" if it negatively impacts your quality of life or relationships. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

## Combining Strategies for Financial Success
Individuals rarely rely on just one method; most choose a combination of these four approaches. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> The best approach depends on personal risk tolerance, lifestyle, and financial situation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>

For instance:
*   A risk-averse individual with a high-paying job might combine investing wisely with being frugal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
*   Someone who likes risks but dislikes frugality might focus on starting and scaling a business and investing profits wisely. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>
*   Those with significant financial responsibilities, like parents, might focus on leveling up their salary through promotions, raises, or training, and then investing any surplus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>

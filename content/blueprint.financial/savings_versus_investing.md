Starting to invest can be one of the most confusing parts of personal finance, with many conflicting opinions and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines a five-step framework that works for anyone focused on [[investing_vs_saving_in_a_tfsa | saving versus investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Power of Smart Investing

To illustrate the difference between investing and merely saving, consider the examples of Low Growth Larry and Steady Investor Sally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:

*   **Low Growth Larry:** Earns a lot of money and saves $2,000 annually in a TD savings account, earning 0.01% interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Over 30 years, Larry contributes a total of $600,000 but ends up with just $600,931. His money barely grows and loses real value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Steady Investor Sally:** Invests $7,000 annually in a portfolio, earning an annualized 7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Over the same 30 years, she contributes a total of just $210,000, but her investments grow to $777,000, outpacing Larry by over $100,000 even though she contributed far less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Think of investments like a snowball rolling downhill: it starts small but grows larger as it collects more snow, similar to compounding returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Step 1: Develop Your Investment Philosophy (Start with the Why)

This is the most important step in your investment journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Investing without purpose is like setting sail without a destination; you'll end up drifting aimlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Have a clear purpose for investing. Examples include:
*   Saving for a down payment on a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   [[Save or Spend Dilemma for Retirees | Retiring comfortably]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Achieving financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   Funding education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>
*   Providing for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

The more specific and personal your reasons, the stronger your foundation will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For the speaker, the purpose of investing is about freedom, living life on their own terms, and the confidence that comes with financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Knowing your "why" makes it easier to stick to your plan, weather market ups and downs, and make decisions aligned with long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Step 2: Figure Out How Much You Can Contribute

Once your "why" is established, determine your contribution amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

*   **Review your budget:** Assess how much you can realistically set aside each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Track income and expenses to find saving opportunities, even small adjustments like cutting unused subscriptions can free up cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Automate contributions:** Set up recurring transfers to your investment accounts on payday to make investing a habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Contributions are the lifeblood of a growing portfolio; consistent investment maximizes compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For example, consistent investing at a 7% rate of return over 30 years shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:
*   $100 a month grows to over $121,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   $500 a month builds a portfolio worth more than $600,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   $1,000 a month can grow into over $1.2 million, approaching financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Step 3: Choose Your Investments

This step can be time-consuming and confusing, but it's where your investment journey takes shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Understand Your Risk Tolerance and Time Horizon
Before picking investments, assess your comfort with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Are you okay with your portfolio dipping during market downturns? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> Your time horizon—how long you plan to stay invested—also plays a major role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Longer timelines typically allow for higher-risk investments because there's more time to recover from market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Tools like Vanguard's free investor questionnaire can help determine your risk tolerance and investment style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

> — Famed investor Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>

This quote highlights that many people overestimate their risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Where to Start for Beginners
*   **ETFs and Advisors:** Great for beginners as they are diversified and require little management. Examples include all-in-one ETFs like VGRO or Robo-advisors such as Questwealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Individual Stocks:** Once confidence grows, explore stocks in companies you believe in and understand, remembering to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Advanced Options:** With experience, consider real estate, private equity, or hiring portfolio managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

A list of pros and cons for various investment options can be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Two Big Mistakes to Avoid
1.  **Panic Selling:** Staying invested during market downturns is crucial. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 from 2004 to 2024 grew at an annualized rate of 10.5% if fully invested, even through the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Missing just the 10 best days reduced returns to 6.2%, and missing the 30 best days dropped them to 1.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Panic selling often means missing key recovery days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
2.  **Staying on the Sidelines:** Waiting for the perfect time to invest is a losing game. Even investing at the worst possible time often outperforms just sitting in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Start with the basics, learn as you go, and avoid overthinking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Step 4: Choose Your Accounts

Choosing the right investment account can significantly impact your after-tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. In Canada, the TFSA, RRSP, and FHSA offer unique tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

A comparison of $10,000 invested over 30 years at 6% growth, with a current tax rate of 40%, a future retirement tax rate of 20%, and non-registered annual growth taxed at 40%, shows:
*   **RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan):** Comes out ahead with an after-tax balance of $64,327 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is due to an upfront tax refund and tax-deferred growth, best if your retirement tax rate is significantly lower than your current rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account):** A close second, growing to $57,434 entirely tax-free, ideal for flexibility and withdrawals without tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account:** Only grows to $28,896, demonstrating how annual taxation drastically limits compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Step 5: Buy the Investments and Track Performance

Once your accounts and strategies are set, it's time to purchase your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### How to Buy Stocks and ETFs
1.  **Pick a Platform:**
    *   **Well Simple:** User-friendly, great for beginners, offers commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   **Questrade:** Ideal for more active investors or those needing advanced features, with low trading fees and free ETF purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
2.  **Set Up Your Account:** Choose the account type (TFSA, RRSP, FHSA, non-registered), provide personal details, and verify identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
3.  **Fund Your Account:** Transfer money from an existing account (can take weeks) or cash from your savings account (a few business days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
4.  **Place Your Order:** For ETFs, search for the ticker symbol (e.g., VFV for Vanguard S&P 500 ETF), decide how many shares, review cost, and place a market or limit order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The process is similar for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Monitoring Your Investments
*   **Analyze Performance:** Keep an eye on your portfolio to ensure it's on track. Compare returns to benchmarks like the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Rebalance:** If one part of your portfolio, like an individual stock, has grown significantly, rebalance to align with your goals and reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Check for Fees/Taxes:** Be aware of sneaky fees or taxes that can quietly erode returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Track Net Worth:** Calculate your net worth by adding up assets (investments, savings, property) and subtracting liabilities (loans, credit card debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Watching this number grow is motivating and provides a big-picture view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. A free net worth tracker can be downloaded from the speaker's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Be Consistent:** Whether you check investments monthly, quarterly, or annually, pick a schedule and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Learn from Mistakes:** Everyone makes mistakes in investing, such as panic selling during a dip or staying in cash too long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The key is to learn, adjust your strategy, focus on long-term goals, and avoid letting short-term emotions derail you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

If managing investments feels overwhelming or results aren't met, hiring a portfolio manager can be a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Find an unbiased expert focused on helping you grow your money, rather than just selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Interview several managers and ensure their approach aligns with your investment philosophy, asking about fees and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Whether you manage your investments yourself or hire someone, the key is to get started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

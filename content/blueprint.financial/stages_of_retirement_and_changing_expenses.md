A common concern for individuals [[financial_planning_for_retirement | planning for retirement]] is understanding what their monthly spending will look like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down average spending for Canadian retirees, what they spend their money on, and how spending changes through different [[impact_of_age_on_retirement_spending_patterns | stages of retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overall Household Expenditure by Age

Data compiled from Stat Canada illustrates how household spending evolves with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Middle-aged Households (40-54 years)**
    Spending is at its highest peak, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is driven by higher family needs, including larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there's a strong focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-retirement Households (55-64 years)**
    Spending decreases slightly to an average of $99,250 annually or $8,270 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There's also an increased focus on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65 years and over)**
    Spending drops further to $61,800 annually, which is about $5,150 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease due to less work-related travel, and there is generally less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The overall average household expenditure for Canadian retirees (aged 65 and over) was $61,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Breakdown of Canadian Retiree Expenditures

For retirees in Canada, the largest portion of expenditures goes to shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

*   **Shelter:** Averages $13,814 annually, or $1,151 per month, representing 22.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Even with many retirees owning their homes, significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities persist, underscoring the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Food:** Retirees spend approximately $7,667 annually on food, averaging $639 per month, or 12.4% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation:** Represents 8.8% of the monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. While generally lower than for younger individuals, it remains a major expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Accounts for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Even with free healthcare in Canada, retirees allocate a higher portion due to increased medical needs as they age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions:** Take up 5.4% of monthly spending, highlighting the need for continued financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations:** Expenses for maintaining the home amount to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending typically occurs in three phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Case Study: Alex's Retirement Spending

Consider Alex, a Canadian navigating his household expenses through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

*   **Early Retirement (65-70 years)**
    Alex spends approximately $70,000 annually, or about $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Housing costs are still high but reduced since his mortgage is paid off, though maintenance and property taxes remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Transportation costs decrease significantly without daily commutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Food spending is slightly less as he dines out less and prepares more meals at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Alex also enjoys spending on hobbies and travel, utilizing his new free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years)**
    Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, possibly due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Transportation costs reduce further as he travels less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Food costs remain stable or decrease as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Spending on travel also reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Later Retirement (75+ years)**
    Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year, or around $4,167 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Transportation costs are significantly lower as he rarely travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Healthcare becomes a major expense, including potential long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Travel spending largely ceases, and Alex focuses more on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This progression of spending changes is typical of many retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. As individuals become less active in later years, they tend to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Real-Life Client Observations

Financial planning firms often observe a wide range of [[reallife_examples_of_retirement_budgets | retirement spending patterns]] among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

On average, retirees spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-end households might spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common [[mindset_shift_in_retirement_spending | trend]] is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This reduction is attributed to factors such as:
*   Lower housing costs (e.g., mortgage paid off) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>
*   Decreased transportation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   Overall lifestyle changes as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   Decline in spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

Understanding these [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | trends]] can help in [[calculating_and_planning_for_retirement_expenses | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] by anticipating changes in spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This ensures sufficient savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

The average cost of raising a child in Canada from birth to age 17 is estimated at a staggering $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This amount is comparable to the cost of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Annually, this breaks down to about $17,235 per year for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Spending by Income Level

The cost of raising a child varies significantly based on household income:
*   **Higher-income families** (earning over $135,000 annually) spend even more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Lower-income families** (earning less than $83,000 annually) spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a key government program designed to help families offset these significant expenses. It is a tax-free payment that assists families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Maximum Benefits

If a family qualifies for the maximum CCB, they can receive up to $125,500 per child over 18 years, entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The maximum annual payments break down by age:
*   **Kids under six:** Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   **Kids aged 6 to 17:** Up to $6,570 per year, totaling $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Impact of Multiple Children

There is no limit to the number of children for whom a family can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   With one child, the benefit is approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   For two children, this doubles to $251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   For three children, it's a whopping $376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   In extreme cases, such as a family with 18 children, they could receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

For lower-income families, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire [[child_care_expense_claims_in_canada | cost of raising a child]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Key Features of the CCB

The CCB has two primary features:
1.  **Indexed to Inflation:** The amount of the benefit grows over time to keep pace with [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | rising costs]], meaning future payments will be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
2.  **Tax-Free:** Every dollar received from the CCB is entirely yours to keep, with no deductions or surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### How CCB Funds Can Be Used

Families can use the CCB money however they need, as there are no restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This includes expenses like food, housing, or education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Eligibility and Calculation

The CCB is based on a family's Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, AFNI combines both spouses' incomes minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. As net income increases, the CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Lower-income families receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced payments or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The reduction happens in two stages:
*   If income is between $36,525 and $79,000, the CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   If income is above approximately $79,000 (after the first reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over $79,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

#### Example: CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six

| Adjusted Family Net Income | Annual Benefit | Monthly Benefit |
| :------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| $35,000 or less            | $7,777         | $649            |
| $50,000                    | $6,840         | $570            |
| $100,000                   | $2,776         | $231            |
| $130,000                   | $1,814         | $151            |

As income increases, the annual and monthly benefit decreases, eventually phasing out completely at very high income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For exact numbers, the CRA's CCB calculator is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Receiving Payments

Receiving the CCB is straightforward:
*   The CRA automatically calculates payments once taxes are filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. No extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Ensure you and your partner file taxes annually and your child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   For faster payments, set up direct deposit with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   CCB payment dates are typically between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   Keep your information up to date with the CRA if your family's income changes (e.g., job loss, marriage, birth of a baby, divorce) or if there are changes in shared custody arrangements, as this could qualify you for higher payments or affect payment splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Purpose and Impact

The CCB was introduced as a key tool to reduce child poverty and support families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has significantly impacted poverty reduction, helping lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. That same year, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging family growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

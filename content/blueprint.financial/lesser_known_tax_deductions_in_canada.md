From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

One of the quickest ways to grow your bank account in Canada is by spending less on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Canadian government refunded over $30 billion to Canadians for returns received from February to June in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite this, only 18% of Canadians feel they understand the tax credits and benefits they may be entitled to, according to an H&R Block survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This indicates significant opportunities for tax refunds and deductions that many may not be aware of, potentially saving thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article focuses on lesser-known deductions beyond common ones like RSP or TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Moving Expenses

Moving expenses are costs incurred when relocating to a new home in Canada to be closer to a new place of work or to attend a post-secondary institution full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These expenses can be deducted from your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Eligibility and Eligible Expenses
To be eligible, you must move at least 40 km closer to your new work or school location within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Eligible expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>:
*   Transportation and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Travel expenses (gas, meals, accommodations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses for up to 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   Costs associated with selling your old home, such as real estate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Costs of buying your new home, including legal fees and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

### Example
Emma moved 300 km for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Her expenses included:
*   Moving company: $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Travel expenses: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses: $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Real estate commission for selling old home: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   **Total expenses: $8,000** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

If Emma's income for that year was $70,000, her new taxable income after deducting moving expenses would be $62,000 ($70,000 - $8,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Work From Home Deduction

This deduction can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars in tax savings, especially with many people working from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Eligibility and Calculation
To claim this deduction, you must have worked from home more than 50% of the time for at least four consecutive weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, and your employer must not have reimbursed all your home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. You will need to fill out form T2200S and have it signed by your employer, keeping all receipts and records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

You can claim a portion of expenses such as <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>:
*   Utilities (electricity, heating, water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
*   Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Maintenance and minor repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

To calculate the deduction, determine the percentage of your home used for work by measuring your workspace size relative to your home's total area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Multiply your total eligible expenses by this workspace percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, if your workspace is 200 sq ft and your home is 1,000 sq ft (20%), and your total eligible expenses are $5,000, you can claim a deduction of $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Child Care Expenses

To claim child care expenses, the child must be under 16 years old or have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Eligible and Non-Eligible Expenses
Eligible expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   Daycare centers and nurseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Caregivers like nannies or babysitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Boarding schools and overnight camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   Educational institutions for the portion related to child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

You cannot claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
*   Medical or hospital care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   Tuition for regular schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Recreational activities (sports, art classes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

### Claim Limits
The maximum claim per child depends on their age and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>:
*   Under 7 years of age: Up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   Between 7 and 16 years: $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   With a disability: $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>

### Example
If you have two children, ages 4 and 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>:
*   Spent $6,000 on daycare for the 4-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Spent $4,000 on after-school care for the 9-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>

Since both amounts are under the maximum allowable deduction for their respective age groups, you can claim the full $6,000 and $4,000, totaling $10,000 that you can deduct on your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Filing Taxes On Time

Approximately 25% of Canadians missed filing their taxes on time in 2024, leading to unnecessary interest and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Filing on time is crucial to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | maximize tax deductions and credits]].### Importance and Penalties
Late filing can result in significant penalties and interest charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The penalty for filing late is 5% of your balance owing, plus 1% for each full month your return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Filing on time also ensures you receive important benefits and credits like the Canada Child Benefit (CCB) and GST/HST credit without delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Deadlines
*   **Self-employed individuals**: Must file by June 15th, and taxes are due by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Regular employees**: Must file and pay taxes by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Example
John has a tax balance owing of $2,000 and files his tax return 3 months late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Late filing penalty: 5% of $2,000 = $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
*   Additional monthly penalty: $20 per month (1% of $2,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   Total penalty for 3 months: $100 + ($20 * 3) = $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>

## Medical Expenses

To claim [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expenses]], the cost must be incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or your dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The expenses must be paid within any 12-month period ending in the tax year and not previously claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Eligible and Non-Eligible Expenses
Common eligible medical expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>:
*   Prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   Dental services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Vision care (glasses, contact lenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Professional services (physiotherapy, chiropractor, psychological services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Medical devices and equipment prescribed by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
It is recommended to check the CRA website if unsure about eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Commonly mistaken non-eligible expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>:
*   Over-the-counter medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   Health club memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   Non-prescription supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

### Claim Limits
For 2024, you can only claim expenses exceeding the lesser of $2,759 or 3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Example
If you have a net income of $60,000 and incurred $3,000 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>:
*   3% of your net income ($60,000) is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   The threshold is the lesser of $1,800 or $2,759.
*   The maximum you can deduct is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a new registered account designed to help Canadians save for their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. It combines features of both the RSP and TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Benefits
*   **Flexibility**: If you don't buy a home, you can transfer your savings to an RSP or RRIF without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **No impact on RSP room**: Contributions to your FHSA do not affect your RSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **No repayment required**: Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan under the RSP, amounts withdrawn from your FHSA for a home purchase do not need to be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
Contributions to your FHSA are tax-deductible, similar to an RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Eligibility
You must be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>:
*   A Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
*   At least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>
*   A first-time home buyer, meaning you haven't owned a home in the current year or the previous four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Example Scenarios
Sarah, 30, wants to buy her first home in the next 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. She opens an FHSA and contributes $8,000 annually, with a marginal tax rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. After 5 years, she has contributed $40,000, and with tax-free growth, her account grows to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. She has saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1: Sarah buys a home**: Sarah withdraws the $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment, significantly boosting her ability to afford a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2: Sarah doesn't buy a home**: After 15 years, she can transfer the amount in her FHSA to her RSP or RRIF tax-free, and her savings will continue to grow tax-deferred until she withdraws them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

The FHSA is a win-win whether you buy a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The CCB is a tax-free monthly payment to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. It provides financial support to those who need it most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Eligibility
To be eligible for the CCB, you must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>:
*   Live with a child under 18 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
*   Be primarily responsible for the care and upbringing of the child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
*   You or your spouse/common-law partner must be a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident, a protected person, or a temporary resident who has lived in Canada for the previous 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

The amount you receive depends on your adjusted family net income and the number of children you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The CRA recalculates the benefit every July based on your previous year's tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. If your adjusted net family income is above $34,863, the benefit may start to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Benefit Amounts (Maximum Annual)
*   Per child under 6: $7,437 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>
*   Per child aged 6 to 17: $6,275 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>

## Canada Caregiver Credit (CCC)

The CCC is a non-refundable [[key_canadian_tax_credits_and_benefits | tax credit]] that helps individuals who support a spouse, common-law partner, or dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Eligibility and Amount
You must support a spouse, common-law partner, or dependent with a physical or mental impairment, and be responsible for their care and upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Eligible dependents can include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>:
*   Your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>
*   Your or your spouse's/common-law partner's child or grandchild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>
*   A parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece, or nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>

The amount of the credit depends on your relationship with the dependent and their net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The base amount for the CCC is up to $7,999 for each eligible dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Canada Training Credit (CTC)

The CTC is a refundable [[key_canadian_tax_credits_and_benefits | tax credit]] that helps Canadians cover the cost of work-related training to develop skills and improve employability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### Eligibility and Limit
To be eligible for the CTC, you must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>:
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>
*   Be between 26 and 65 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>
*   Have earnings of at least $10,000 from employment or self-employment, but not more than $150,000 in the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>
*   Have filed a tax return for the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>
*   Have a CTC limit still available, which starts at $250 per year up to a lifetime limit of $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

You can claim the lesser of your CTC limit or 50% of your eligible tuition and fees for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Example
Lisa earns $50,000 annually and takes a course costing $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Her CTC credit limit for the year is $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. She can claim the lesser of $250 or 50% of her $1,000 tuition fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Since 50% of $1,000 is $500, but her CTC limit is $250, Lisa can claim $250 as a tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

## Tuition Tax Credit

The tuition [[key_canadian_tax_credits_and_benefits | tax credit]] is a non-refundable tax credit that helps students in Canada reduce their income taxes by claiming eligible tuition fees paid for post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Eligibility and Eligible Expenses
To be eligible, you must be enrolled at a designated educational institution in a qualifying program and have paid more than $100 in eligible tuition fees for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Eligible expenses include tuition fees for courses taken at post-secondary institutions and certain occupational skills courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Example
Sarah is a university student who paid $6,000 in eligible tuition fees this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   Federal tuition tax credit rate is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, so her federal credit is 15% of $6,000 = $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   Assuming her province has a rate of 10% for simplicity, her provincial tax credit is 10% of $6,000 = $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   Total tax credit: $900 + $600 = $1,500, which she can use to reduce her income tax owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Pension Income Splitting

Pension income splitting allows you to transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your spouse or common-law partner for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This can help reduce your overall family tax bill by taking advantage of a lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Eligibility and Eligible Income
To be eligible, you must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>:
*   Receive eligible pension income (e.g., payments from a registered pension plan, RRIF, or annuity payments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   Be married or in a common-law relationship at the end of the tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

Eligible income typically includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>:
*   Pension income from a registered pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>
*   Annuity payments from an RSP or RRIF if you were 65 or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>
*   Certain other annuity payments received by individuals 65 or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>

## Digital News Subscription Tax Credit

This tax credit helps Canadians save money on their taxes when they subscribe to qualified Canadian digital news services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Eligibility and Limit

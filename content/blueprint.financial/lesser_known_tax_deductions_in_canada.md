One of the quickest ways to grow a bank account in Canada is by spending less on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. In 2024, the government refunded over $30 billion to Canadians for returns received from February to June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite this, only 18% of Canadians feel they understand the [[tax_credits_and_benefits_available_in_canada | tax credits and benefits]] they may be entitled to, according to an H&R Block survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This indicates significant opportunities for [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | tax refunds deductions]] that could save thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article focuses on lesser-known tax deductions that can result in hundreds or even thousands of dollars in [[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada | tax saving]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Moving Expenses

Moving expenses are costs incurred when moving to a new home in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These expenses can be deducted from your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

**Eligibility:**
*   You must move at least 40 km closer to your new work or school location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   The move must be within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   The purpose of the move must be to be closer to a place of work or to attend a post-secondary institution full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

**Eligible Expenses:**
*   Transportation and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Travel expenses (e.g., gas, meals, accommodations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Temporary living expenses for up to 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Costs associated with selling your old home, such as real estate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   Costs of buying your new home, including legal fees and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

**Example:**
Emma moved 300 km for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Her expenses included:
*   Moving company: $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Travel expenses: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses: $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Real estate commission for selling her old home: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
Her total expenses were $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. With an income of $70,000, her new taxable income after deduction would be $62,000 ($70,000 - $8,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Work From Home Deduction

This deduction can amount to hundreds or thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

**Eligibility:**
*   You must have worked from home more than 50% of the time for at least four consecutive weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   Your employer must not have reimbursed you for all home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   You need to fill out Form T2200S and have it signed by your employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Keep all receipts and records of your expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

**Eligible Expenses:**
*   A portion of utilities (e.g., electricity, heating, water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

*   Maintenance and minor repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

**Calculation:**
1.  Measure the size of your workspace and your home to determine the percentage of your home used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For example, if your workspace is 200 sq ft and your home is 1,000 sq ft, your workspace percentage is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
2.  Multiply your total eligible expenses by your workspace percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. For example, if total expenses are $5,000 and your workspace is 20%, you can claim $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Child Care Expenses

**Eligibility:**
*   The child must be under 16 years old or have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

**Eligible Expenses:**

*   With a disability: $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

**Example:**
In 2023, you spent $6,000 on daycare for a 4-year-old and $4,000 on after-school care for a 9-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Since both amounts are under the maximum allowable deduction for their age groups, you can claim the full $6,000 and $4,000, totaling $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Filing Taxes on Time

About 25% of Canadians missed filing their taxes on time in 2024, leading to unnecessary interest and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

**Reasons for Timely Filing:**
*   **Avoid Penalties:** Late filing incurs penalties and interest charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The penalty for filing late is 5% of your balance owing, plus 1% for each full month your return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Receive Benefits:** Filing on time ensures you receive benefits and credits like the Canada Child Benefit and GST/HST credit without delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

**Example:**
John has a tax balance owing of $2,000 and files his return 3 months late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. His late filing penalty is 5% of $2,000 ($100), plus an additional monthly penalty of $20 (1% of $2,000) for each of the 3 months ($60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His total penalty for 3 months is $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**Important Deadlines:**
*   **Self-employed:** File by June 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Taxes are due by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Regular employee:** File and pay taxes by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

*   Medical devices and equipment prescribed by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
    *   Check the CRA website if unsure about eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

**Ineligible Expenses:**
*   Over-the-counter medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   Health club memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   Non-prescription supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

**Claim Limit:**
*   For 2024, you can only claim expenses exceeding the lesser of $2,759 or 3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Example:**
With a net income of $60,000 and $3,000 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, the maximum you can claim is the lesser of 3% of $60,000 ($1,800) or $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Therefore, the maximum deduction is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a new registered account designed to help Canadians save for their first home, combining features of both RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Contributions are tax-deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

**Benefits:**
*   **Flexibility:** If you don't buy a home, you can transfer savings to an RRSP or RRIF without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **No Impact on RRSP Room:** FHSA contributions don't affect your RRSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **No Repayment Required:** Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan under the RRSP, amounts withdrawn from your FHSA for a home purchase don't need to be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

**Eligibility:**
*   Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

**Example:**
Sarah, 30, wants to buy her first home within 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. She contributes $8,000 annually to her FHSA, with a marginal tax rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. After 5 years, she contributed $40,000, and her account grows tax-free to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. She saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Scenario 1 (Buys a home):** Sarah withdraws $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2 (Doesn't buy a home):** After 15 years, she can transfer the amount to her RRSP or RRIF tax-free, and her savings continue to grow tax-deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

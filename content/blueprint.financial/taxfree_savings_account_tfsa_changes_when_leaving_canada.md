When a Canadian becomes a permanent non-resident, their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is subject to several important changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## TFSA Status for Non-Residents

### Good News
*   **Account Status** Your TFSA maintains its tax-free status in Canada even if you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This means the growth within the TFSA remains tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals** You can still withdraw funds from your TFSA while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These withdrawals are added back to your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Repatriation** If you decide to return to Canada as a resident again, you can resume normal TFSA activities, including making contributions up to your available room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Bad News
*   **New Contributions** You cannot make new contributions to your TFSA while you are a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, your existing TFSA can remain open and continue to grow tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Penalties** If you contribute to your TFSA as a non-resident, you may face [[understanding_cra_penalties_and_taxes_on_tfsa | hefty penalties]] of 1% per month on the contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   For example, contributing $5,000 as a non-resident could incur a penalty of $50 per month until the amount is withdrawn, totaling $600 over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This significantly reduces the benefits of your investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Contribution Room** You do not accumulate new TFSA contribution room for any of the years during which you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Tax Implications Abroad
While the growth within the TFSA remains tax-free in Canada, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains from your TFSA according to its tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Example: Moving to the US** If you move to the US, the IRS does not recognize the TFSA and will tax all incoming gains from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. In this scenario, it might be advisable to collapse the TFSA account before moving to the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Awareness is Key** It is crucial to be aware of the tax rules of the country you are moving to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Pro Tip Before Leaving Canada
*   **Max Out Contributions** Before you leave Canada, consider maximizing your TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This allows your investments to continue growing tax-free while you are abroad, as you cannot contribute more once you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

For overall financial planning when leaving Canada, it is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional to understand specific details and implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Ideally, seek advice from professionals in both Canada and your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

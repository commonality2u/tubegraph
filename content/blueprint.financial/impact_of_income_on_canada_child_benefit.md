The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It is indexed to inflation, meaning the amount grows over time, and every dollar received is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The CCB can be used for any family needs, including food, housing, or education, as there are no restrictions on its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Impact of Income on CCB Amounts

The amount of Canada Child Benefit a family receives is directly tied to their income. The CCB is based on a family's Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, this involves combining both spouses' incomes minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

As a family's net income increases, their CCB payments decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families will see reduced payments or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

#### Reduction Stages

The reduction in CCB payments occurs in two stages based on a family's net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:

*   **First Reduction Stage**
    *   If family income is between approximately $36,525 and $79,000, the CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   This stage has a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Second Reduction Stage**
    *   If family income is above approximately $79,000 (after the initial $3,000 reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over the $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

#### Example: CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six

The following examples illustrate how the CCB benefit gradually decreases as income rises for one child under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:

*   **Income $35,000 or less:** Families receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year, or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Income $50,000:** The annual benefit is reduced to about $6,884, or approximately $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Income $100,000:** The annual benefit drops significantly to around $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Income $130,000:** The benefit is further reduced to about $1,814 per year, or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

At very high-income levels, the CCB benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> For families with multiple children, the calculations for CCB become more complex. It is recommended to use the CRA's CCB calculator for accurate figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The CRA can also be contacted directly for assistance with any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Automatic Calculation and Updates

The CRA automatically calculates CCB payments once families file their annual taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. There is no separate application needed, provided both partners file their taxes every year and the child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

It is crucial to keep your information up to date with the CRA. If your family's income changes due to events like job loss, marriage, the birth of a new baby, or divorce, updating the CRA right away can result in qualifying for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Changes in shared custody arrangements should also be reported, as the CRA typically splits payments 50/50 in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Purpose of the CCB

The CCB is a key tool in reducing [[effect_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | child poverty]] and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Since its launch, it has significantly impacted poverty reduction, helping to lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. It supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six in that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

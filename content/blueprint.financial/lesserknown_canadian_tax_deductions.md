One of the most effective ways to increase your bank account in Canada is by reducing the amount you spend on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. In 2024, the Canadian government refunded over $30 billion to Canadians from returns processed between February and June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite this, an H&R Block survey indicates that only 18% of Canadians feel they understand the [[tax_deductions_and_credits_commonly_missed_by_canadians | tax credits and benefits]] they might be entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This highlights a significant opportunity for tax refunds and deductions that could save individuals thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

This article focuses on lesser-known tax deductions that can result in hundreds or even thousands of dollars in tax savings, beyond common deductions like RRSP or TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Moving Expenses

Moving expenses are costs incurred when relocating to a new home in Canada to be closer to a new job or to attend a post-secondary institution full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These expenses can be deducted from your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Eligibility
To claim moving expenses, your new residence must be at least 40 km closer to your new work or school location, and the move must be within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
*   Transportation and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Travel expenses (e.g., gas, meals, accommodations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses for up to 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Costs associated with selling your old home, such as real estate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Costs of buying your new home, including legal fees and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

### Example
Emma moved 300 km for a new job and incurred the following expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>:
*   Moving company: $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Travel expenses: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses: $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Real estate commission for selling her old home: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
Her total expenses amounted to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. With an income of $70,000, her new taxable income after deducting moving expenses would be $62,000 ($70,000 - $8,000), leading to significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Work From Home Deduction

Given the increase in remote work, this deduction can result in hundreds or thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Eligibility
*   You must have worked from home more than 50% of the time for at least four consecutive weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Your employer must not have reimbursed you for all home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   You need to fill out Form T2200S, signed by your employer, and keep all receipts and records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
You can claim a portion of expenses for:
*   Utilities (electricity, heating, water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Maintenance and minor repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>

### Calculation
Measure your workspace size and your home's total area to determine the percentage of your home used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Multiply your total eligible expenses by this percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For example, if your workspace is 200 sq ft and your home is 1,000 sq ft, your workspace percentage is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If total expenses are $5,000, you can claim a $1,000 deduction ($5,000 * 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Child Care Expenses

### Eligibility
The child must be under 16 years old or have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
*   Daycare centers and nurseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Caregivers like nannies or babysitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Boarding schools and overnight camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   A portion of educational institution fees related to child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>

### Ineligible Expenses
*   Medical or hospital care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   Tuition for regular schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Recreational activities (e.g., sports, art classes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

### Claim Limits
The maximum claim per child depends on age and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>:
*   Under 7 years old: Up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   7 to 16 years old: Up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   With a disability: Up to $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>

### Example
In 2023, if you had two children aged 4 and 9, and spent $6,000 on daycare for the 4-year-old and $4,000 on after-school care for the 9-year-old, you could claim the full $10,000 total deduction as both amounts are under the maximum allowable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Filing Taxes on Time

Approximately 25% of Canadians missed filing their taxes on time in 2024, leading to unnecessary interest and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Reasons to File on Time
*   **Avoid Penalties**: Late filing incurs penalties and interest charges. The penalty is 5% of your balance owing, plus 1% for each full month your return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Receive Benefits**: Filing on time ensures prompt receipt of benefits and credits like the Canada Child Benefit and GST/HST credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Example
John has a tax balance of $2,000 and files his return 3 months late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. His late filing penalty is 5% of $2,000 ($100), plus an additional monthly penalty of 1% ($20) per month for 3 months ($60). His total penalty for 3 months is $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Deadlines
*   **Self-employed**: File by June 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Taxes are due by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Regular employees**: File and pay taxes by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_Canada | Medical Expenses]]

To claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | medical expenses]], the cost must be incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or your dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Expenses must be paid within any 12-month period ending in the tax year and not previously claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Common Eligible Expenses
*   Prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
*   Dental Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   Vision Care (glasses, contact lenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Professional Services (physiotherapy, chiropractor, psychological services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Medical devices and equipment prescribed by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
(It is advisable to check the CRA website if unsure about expense qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.)

### Ineligible Expenses (Common Misconceptions)
*   Over-the-counter medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Health Club memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
*   Non-prescription supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

### Claim Limit
For 2024, you can only claim expenses exceeding the lesser of $2,759 or 3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Example
If your net income is $60,000 and you incurred $3,000 in medical expenses in 2024, the maximum you can claim is the lesser of 3% of your net income ($1,800) or $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Thus, you can deduct $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a new registered account designed to help Canadians save for their first home, combining features of both RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Benefits
*   **Flexibility**: If you don't buy a home, you can transfer savings to an RRSP or RRIF without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **No Impact on RRSP Room**: Contributions to your FHSA do not affect your RRSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **No Repayment Required**: Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan under the RRSP, amounts withdrawn from your FHSA for a home purchase do not need to be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Tax Deductible Contributions**: Contributions are tax deductible, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Eligibility
*   Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
*   At least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>
*   First-time home buyer (haven't owned a home in the current year or the previous four years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

### Example
Sarah, 30, plans to buy her first home in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. She contributes $8,000 annually to her FHSA, with a marginal tax rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. After 5 years, she contributed $40,000, and with tax-free growth, her account reaches $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. She saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1: Sarah buys a home**: She withdraws the $50,000 completely tax-free for her down payment, significantly boosting her ability to afford a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Scenario 2: Sarah doesn't buy a home**: After 15 years, she can transfer the amount in her FHSA to her RRSP or RRIF tax-free, allowing her savings to continue growing tax-deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The CCB is a tax-free monthly payment to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. It targets financial support for those most in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

The CRA recalculates the benefit every July based on the previous year's tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. For income above $34,636, the benefit amount begins to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### Maximum Annual Benefit
*   Per child under six: $7,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>
*   Per child aged 6 to 17: $6,275 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>

### Claim Amount
You can claim the lesser of your CTC limit or 50% of your eligible tuition and fees for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Example

## Tuition Tax Credit

This non-refundable tax credit helps students in Canada reduce their income taxes by claiming eligible tuition fees for post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Example
Sarah, a university student, paid $6,000 in eligible tuition fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The federal tuition tax credit rate is 15%, so her federal credit is $900 (15% of $6,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. If her province has a 10% rate, her provincial credit is $600 (10% of $6,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Her total tax credit is $1,500, which she can use to reduce her income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

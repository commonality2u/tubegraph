Many Canadian retirees make a common mistake by not properly managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals, which can lead to leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. By implementing a smart RSP to Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) tactic, retirees can reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and enjoy a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue for many retirees is having wasted TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
Statistics show that out of 17.77 million Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This indicates that the majority are missing out on the incredible tax-free growth potential offered by TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many Canadians enter their golden years with unused TFSA contribution room, often accumulating tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% of them maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before slightly dropping to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are effective for saving during working years, but all withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. At age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requires conversion of an RSP into a Registered Income Fund (RIF) and mandates withdrawals, regardless of immediate financial need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

If retirees do not need all the money from their mandatory RIF withdrawals, a key [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | strategy]] is to put any excess funds into their TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach can save thousands in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA mandates he withdraw $30,000 per year, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In a 30% tax bracket, Eddie owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 for living expenses, covered mostly by his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Instead of putting this into a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Assuming an average annual growth of 6%:
*   **Year 1:** Eddie contributes $10,000, growing to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Years:** Eddie continues to add $10,000 annually, benefiting from compounding growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After 10 Years:** Eddie has contributed $100,000 to his TFSA, which has grown to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Comparison: TFSA vs. Other Accounts

*   **Non-Registered Account:** If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, growing at 6% annually, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, reducing the effective rate to about 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. After 10 years, this account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes, significantly less than the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Taxable Savings Account:** Investing in a taxable savings account earning only 1% would result in much lower growth than even a non-registered investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

By contributing his excess income into his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Grows his TFSA balance to $132,000, compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, or closer to $55,000 in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

This approach maximizes retirement savings and provides flexibility for future needs or continued tax-free compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Pro Tips for [[Tax Efficient Investment Strategies in Canada | Tax-Efficient Investment Strategies]]

*   **Prioritize TFSA:** Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room. This allows your money to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Avoid Large RSP Withdrawals:** Do not withdraw large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of a property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Does this Eliminate RSP Taxes on Withdrawal?

No, this [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | strategy]] does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals remain taxable income subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can reduce your taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The key is to minimize the tax impact while maximizing overall retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

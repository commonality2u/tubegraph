The year 2025 brings several important updates regarding Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, including payment schedules, cost-of-living adjustments, and crucial information on [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] thresholds. These changes are designed to help seniors manage their finances and maintain purchasing power.

## Unified Payment Schedule for CPP, OAS, and GIS

For 2025, the Government of Canada has implemented a unified payment schedule for [[pension_and_retiree_tax_updates_including_cpp_and_oas | CPP]], [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | OAS]], and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means recipients will receive payments for all three programs on the same day, typically in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a scheduled payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the payment will be issued earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

It is highly recommended to set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account for added convenience and security, ensuring your money arrives on time and is a safer alternative to mail checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Cost of Living Adjustment for OAS

[[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | OAS payments]] are reviewed quarterly to align with inflation, rather than annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For the period of January to March 2025, there will not be an increase in [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | OAS benefits]] due to a slight dip in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the preceding months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Despite this, over the past year, [[oas_benefits_and_tax_implications_for_nonresidents | OAS benefits]] have still seen a 2% growth, helping seniors keep pace with rising living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS Clawback Threshold]] Update

The [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS pension recovery tax]], commonly known as the clawback, mandates that higher-income seniors repay a portion or all of their [[oas_benefits_and_tax_implications_for_nonresidents | OAS benefits]] if their net income surpasses a specific threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

For the period covering July 2024 to June 2025, the [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback threshold]] is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Seniors whose net income exceeds this amount are required to repay 15% of the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Example of Clawback Calculation

If your net income is $100,000, the repayment would be calculated as 15% of the difference between your income and the threshold:
$15\% \times (\$100,000 - \$90,997) = 15\% \times \$9,003 = \$1,350$ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Strategies to Minimize Impact

To minimize the impact of the [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]], seniors can employ [[investment_strategies_for_minimizing_oas_clawback | strategies such as income splitting]] or utilizing a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. These methods can help keep your net income below the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Increased OAS Pension at Age 75

Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | OAS payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This measure was introduced in July 2022 to address the financial challenges faced by older seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

For the January to March 2025 quarter:
*   Maximum monthly [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | OAS payment]] for ages 65 to 74 will be $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Maximum monthly payment for ages 75 or older will increase to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

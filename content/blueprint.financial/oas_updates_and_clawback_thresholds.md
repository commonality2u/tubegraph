The 2025 pension updates could significantly impact retirement plans, particularly concerning [[pension_and_retiree_tax_changes_including_cpp_and_oas | CPP and OAS benefits]]. Understanding these changes, including the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] and payment schedules, is crucial for maximizing benefits and saving on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Unified Payment Schedule for OAS, CPP, and GIS

For 2025, the Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for Old Age Security (OAS), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This means payments for all three benefits will be received on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

Payment dates are typically in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For convenience, setting up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account ensures on-time, safer, and more reliable delivery compared to mail checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## OAS Updates for 2025

### Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly, not annually, to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For the January to March 2025 period, there will not be an increase due to a small dip in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the preceding months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, over the past year, OAS benefits have still grown by 2%, helping seniors manage rising living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### OAS Clawback Threshold Update

The [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | OAS pension recovery tax]], commonly known as the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | clawback]], requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their OAS benefits if their net income exceeds a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

*   **Threshold:** For the period from July 2024 to June 2025, the threshold is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Repayment Rate:** Seniors whose net income surpasses this amount are required to repay 15% of the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Example:** If a senior's net income is $100,000, the repayment would be 15% of ($100,000 - $90,997), amounting to approximately $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

To minimize the impact of the [[understanding_the_oas_clawback | clawback]], [[strategies_to_reduce_oas_clawback | strategies]] such as income splitting or using a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can help keep net income below the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Increased OAS Pension at Age 75

Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This measure was introduced in July 2022 to address financial challenges faced by older seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

For the January to March 2025 quarter:
*   Maximum monthly OAS payment for those aged 65 to 74 will be $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   Maximum monthly OAS payment for those aged 75 or older increases to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

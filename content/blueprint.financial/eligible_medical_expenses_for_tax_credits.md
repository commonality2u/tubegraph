Paying for medical care can be a significant financial burden, even with Canada's healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Fortunately, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claim some medical costs]] on their taxes, helping to keep more money in their pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work in Canada

The [[calculation_of_medical_expense_tax_credits | Medical Expense Tax Credit]] (METC) allows Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

To claim the METC, [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | medical expenses]] must be entered on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For expenses of other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Calculation of the Medical Expense Tax Credit

Only the portion of [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] not reimbursed by insurance can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Furthermore, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or a set threshold amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For 2024 expenses, this threshold is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

**Example**: Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,500 ($50,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,500 = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This $1,000 is claimed as a non-refundable credit, reducing her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Common Eligible Medical Expenses

Several common [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] qualify for the METC.

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

You can [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | claim eligible prescription drugs]] and medications as [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   They must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Medical marijuana is covered if you have a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase it from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: Keep track of all pharmacy receipts and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

**Example**: Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spends $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,800 ($60,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $3,000 - $1,800 = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Sarah can claim $1,200 in [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Many dental and vision expenses are tax deductible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   Eligible expenses are for services provided by licensed professionals like dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Covered expenses include routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Purely cosmetic procedures (e.g., teeth whitening) and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

**Example**: Alex earns $150,000 and spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $4,500 ($150,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   The set threshold for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 from his total [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   He can claim $3,100 - $2,759 = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Higher-income earners often need larger [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures (e.g., laser eye surgery and a root canal) within the same 12-month period to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### [[medical_travel_expenses_and_tax_deductions | Medical Travel Expenses]]

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to [[medical_travel_expenses_and_tax_deductions | claim your travel costs]] as a [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   This applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Eligible travel expenses include public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights) and vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Lodging (hotel, Airbnb) and meals are claimable if required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

**Example**: Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. She spent $800 on gas and parking, and $1,500 on meals and accommodations, for a total of $2,300 in travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,650 ($55,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,300 - $1,650 = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Jennifer can claim $650 of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also [[medical_travel_expenses_and_tax_deductions | claim the travel cost for an accompanying person]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   This includes plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Employer-paid premiums generally do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Premiums for self-employed individuals can be claimed if they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children, which can help [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

**Example**: Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $2,700 ($90,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   His eligible claim is $3,500 - $2,700 = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, verify which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Many medical devices and equipment qualify as tax-deductible [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Eligible items include wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces, and in some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Some medical devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify, so keep records of both the prescription and the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Ongoing maintenance costs, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Example**: Emily earns $65,000 and buys a CPAP machine for $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   3% of her income is $1,950 ($65,000 x 0.03) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,950 = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> While individual claims may seem small, combining them can significantly increase total deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Before making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it's on the CRA's list of eligible medical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## [[maximizing_medical_expense_claims_for_families | Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs]]

If you have a family, properly [[maximizing_medical_expense_claims_for_families | claiming medical expenses]] can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical costs]] for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, and knowing who should claim them can maximize your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

**Example**: Richard and Pauline, a couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), have the following [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses]] for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   Total: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard and Pauline's for a total of $6,300 ($2,500 + $2,000 + $1,800), eligible for line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Let's compare Richard and Pauline's potential claims for the $6,300:
*   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Richard**: Earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income; they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. By organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim, you can [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize tax savings]] when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

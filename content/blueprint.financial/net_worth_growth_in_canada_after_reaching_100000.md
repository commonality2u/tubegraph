From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Net worth for Canadians tends to grow significantly after reaching the initial $100,000 milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canadian households typically achieve a net worth of $100,000 between the ages of 28 and 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

Once this initial amount is reached, net worth begins to grow rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>:
*   Between ages 35 and 44, the [[average_net_worth_by_age_group_in_canada | average net worth]] jumps to almost $660,000, which is over six times the initial $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
*   This momentum continues into the 40s and early 50s, with the [[average_net_worth_by_age_group_in_canada | average net worth]] rising to $1.34 million for Canadians aged 45 to 54, representing over 13 times the initial amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The importance of reaching this first $100,000 is highlighted by Charlie Munger's famous quote: "I don't care what you have to do, just get to $100,000. After that, you can ease off the gas a little bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Why Net Worth Accelerates After $100,000

There are three key reasons for this rapid growth in net worth:

### 1. Investing and Compounding Returns
Once the $100,000 mark is hit, building wealth becomes much easier due to the power of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Consider an example of investing $10,000 per year with a 10% annual return in tax-free accounts like a [[strategies_to_grow_a_tfsa_from_10000_to_100000 | TFSA]] or RSP, aiming for $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>:
*   **0 to $100,000**: Takes a little over 7.27 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This initial milestone takes the longest, primarily driven by disciplined contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **$100,000 to $200,000**: Takes 4.25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **$200,000 to $300,000**: Takes about 3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **$300,000 to $400,000**: Takes 2.34 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **$400,000 to $500,000**: Takes less than 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, showing that invested money is doing more heavy lifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **$500,000 to $600,000**: Takes 1.62 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **$600,000 to $700,000**: Takes 1.4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **$700,000 to $800,000**: Takes 1.24 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **$800,000 to $900,000**: Takes 1.11 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **$900,000 to $1 million**: Takes just one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, as investments generate substantial growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The total time to reach $1 million with this strategy is approximately 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

#### Returns from Contributions Versus Investment Growth
As wealth builds, the balance between savings and investment returns shifts dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>:
*   For the first $100,000, about 73% comes from contributions, with 27% from investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   By the $1 million mark, this flips: 75% of wealth is produced by returns, and only 25% from direct contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   A major tipping point occurs around $300,000, where returns start outpacing contributions, indicating that compounding is fully in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. At $1 million, investments do triple the work of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Compounding is like the launch phase of a rocket: most effort is needed to break free from gravity (getting to the first $100,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Once financial gravity is escaped, the rest of the journey becomes faster and easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

A spreadsheet tool is available online to explore these numbers with custom interest rates and payment amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### 2. Income Growth
Income plays a crucial role in building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. In Canada, the wealth gap between income levels is striking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   In 2024, the lowest 20% income bracket has an [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | average net worth]] of approximately $375,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   The top 20% income bracket, considered [[income_thresholds_for_top_earners_in_canada | top earners]], has an [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | average net worth]] of almost $2.3 million, over 510% higher than the lowest bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   The 21-40% income group has an [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | average net worth]] of about $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   The 41-60% income bracket [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | averages]] about $791,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   The 61-80% group's [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | average net worth]] breaks the million-dollar mark at close to $1.1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

These figures illustrate that as income grows, wealth building becomes faster, and the gap between income levels expands over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

#### [[strategies_for_increasing_income_and_net_worth_in_canada | How to Increase Your Income in Canada]]
Several [[strategies_for_increasing_income_and_net_worth_in_canada | strategies]] can help boost income:
1.  **Location Matters**: Relocating to a province with higher wages can increase income and net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Alberta, for example, offers the highest average income at $61,500 per year, which, combined with relatively lower living costs, allows for greater savings and investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
2.  **Invest in Education**: Higher education significantly boosts earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>:
    *   Bachelor's degree: Median income of approximately $69,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   College diploma: About $47,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   High school: About $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
    *   No certificate: Only about $26,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
3.  **Choose High-Income Careers**: Specialized industries offer higher wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>:
    *   Senior Management: Average of about $91 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   Engineering: Close to $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   Finance, Health, Science roles: About $42-$44 hourly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
    *   Trades and Transport: Solid wages at about $32 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
4.  **Start a Business**: Most of Canada's wealthiest individuals built their fortunes by starting businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Business ownership offers significant wealth potential through growth, profits, and eventual sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### 3. High Savings Rate
Saving a greater portion of what you earn is a fundamental key to building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. If all income is spent, net worth remains at zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Your savings rate is the percentage of income put aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For example, earning $100,000 and saving $20,000 results in a 20% savings rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A higher savings rate allows for more investment, accelerating compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

In Canada, the average savings rate rose to 7.2% in 2024 Q2, up from 4.9% the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Setting a higher savings rate than the national average can significantly enhance investment potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

A major barrier to saving is lifestyle inflation, where spending increases with income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. To counter this, direct extra income from promotions or bonuses directly into savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Starting to save early provides more time for compounding to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Even small, regular savings can snowball over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Savings is a habit; setting aside a fixed percentage of income monthly builds discipline and supports financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Net worth growth is not accidental; it requires a strategic approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The initial $100,000 milestone is a crucial foundation that fuels long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

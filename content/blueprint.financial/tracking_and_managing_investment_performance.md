Once investments have been chosen and accounts funded, the final crucial step is to track and manage their performance to ensure alignment with financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Monitoring Your Investments
Keeping an eye on your portfolio's performance is important to ensure you remain on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Analyze Performance** Compare your returns to benchmarks, such as the S&P 500, to evaluate how your investments are performing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing and Risk Management** If a portion of your portfolio, like an individual stock, significantly outperforms others, it may be time to rebalance. This helps keep your portfolio aligned with your objectives and reduces overall risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Beware of Fees and Taxes** Always check for hidden fees or taxes, as these can subtly erode your returns over time if left unaddressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

*   **Monthly tracking** is suitable for those who prefer to stay closely informed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Quarterly tracking** works well for more stable portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

The important thing is to choose a schedule that fits your needs and adhere to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### Learning from Mistakes
Mistakes are an inevitable part of the investing journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Whether it's panic selling during a market dip or remaining in cash for too long, the critical aspect is to learn from these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Adjust your strategy, maintain focus on your long-term goals, and avoid letting short-term emotions derail your plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Continuous learning will strengthen your ability to stick to your investment game plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Seeking Professional Help
While many individuals can manage their investments independently, life can become busy, or desired results may not be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. If self-managing investments feels overwhelming, hiring a portfolio manager can be an effective solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Choosing a Manager** Look for an unbiased professional who prioritizes growing your money rather than simply selling products for high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Costs and Benefits** While there is a cost associated with professional asset management, it typically includes personalized management, strategic planning, and guidance towards achieving your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Due Diligence** Interview several portfolio managers to ensure their approach aligns with your investment philosophy and ask detailed questions about their fees and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Regardless of whether you manage your investments yourself or enlist professional help, the most important step is to begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

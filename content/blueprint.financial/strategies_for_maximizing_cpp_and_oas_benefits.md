Developing a strategic withdrawal plan for your retirement savings is crucial, as many people focus on contributing and growing their Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs) but overlook the importance of how they will withdraw these funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. While simply taking the minimum amount from a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) to keep it tax-sheltered as long as possible is a valid approach for some, there are many other factors to consider, particularly avoiding tax bracket creep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Withdrawals from an RSP are taxed as income in the year they are taken out, which can push you into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. To minimize your tax burden, it's essential to plan RSP withdrawals for years when you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Strategic Early RSP Withdrawal to Maximize CPP and OAS

One key strategy focuses on maximizing government pension benefits by [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying your CPP and OAS]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This approach involves prioritizing withdrawals from your RSPs and RRIFs to cover your income needs in the years leading up to when you start collecting your government pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### How it Works

Instead of starting Canada Pension Plan (CPP) at age 65, you can [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delay it until age 70]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. If income is needed during this period, you would withdraw from your RSPs and RRIFs to cover expenses until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While delaying until 70 offers the maximum increase, you can also delay to other ages like 66 or 67 depending on your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### CPP Benefit Increases

*   **Starting at age 60 vs. 65**: Starting CPP at age 60 results in a 0.6% reduction per month compared to age 65, totaling a 36% less overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Delaying to age 70 vs. 65**: Delaying CPP until age 70 results in a 0.7% increase per month compared to age 65, totaling a significant 42% more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If your CPP benefit at age 65 would be $1,000 per month, delaying to age 70 would increase it to $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### OAS Benefit Increases

*   **Delaying to age 70 vs. 65**: If you delay your Old Age Security (OAS) benefits until age 70, you will receive 36% more than if you started at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If your full OAS benefit at age 65 is $600 per month, delaying to age 70 would result in approximately $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Benefits of This Strategy

1.  **Increased Payments**: This strategy directly increases your CPP and OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
2.  **More Financial Security**: You are essentially trading the uncertain returns of an RSP for the guaranteed, inflation-indexed returns of your CPP, which also increases annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This provides greater certainty in retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
3.  **Potential to [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks | avoid OAS clawbacks]]**: By strategically managing your income, you can potentially [[strategies_to_avoid_oas_clawback | avoid OAS clawbacks]] if your net income exceeds certain thresholds (e.g., $86,900) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Considerations

This strategy is not suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Health Concerns**: [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying CPP and OAS payments]] makes sense if you expect to live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, if you have health issues or a family history of shorter lifespans, starting benefits earlier might provide more total benefits over your lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Conversely, if you are in good health with a history of longevity, this strategy becomes even more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Comfort with RSP Withdrawals**: Some individuals are uncomfortable with withdrawing significant amounts from their RSPs due to concerns about losing the tax-sheltered status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Using Your TFSA Wisely

Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) plays a crucial role in your overall retirement strategy, particularly in minimizing taxes and preserving government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The key is to use TFSA withdrawals to supplement your income while keeping your taxable income low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

Unlike RSP, CPP, and OAS withdrawals, TFSA withdrawals do not count towards your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This allows you to control your taxable income each year and remain in your desired tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

*   **Example**: John is 68, retired, and receives $20,000 annually from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. He needs an additional $30,000 for living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. By taking $10,000 from his RSP (taxable) and $20,000 from his TFSA (tax-free), he keeps his overall taxable income lower, thus reducing his tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Crucially, since TFSA withdrawals do not count as income, they do not affect your eligibility for government benefits such as OAS or the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Ensure you have enough TFSA contribution room before attempting to move funds, or you could face penalties from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

Managing your retirement accounts like RSP, TFSA, OAS, and CPP requires them to work in harmony to maximize your tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Strategic timing of your RSP withdrawals ensures you get the most out of your retirement savings without paying unnecessary taxes or losing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. For instance, excessively high RSP withdrawals can "drown out" the benefits of your OAS and GIS due to clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, illustrating the [[impact_of_cpp_on_other_benefits_like_oas_and_gis | impact of CPP on other benefits like OAS and GIS]].

There is no single "one-size-fits-all" method for retirement withdrawal strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Some individuals may benefit from early RSP withdrawals to secure a larger CPP, while others might prefer to minimize withdrawals and grow their RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Your unique financial goals and personal situation will dictate the best approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Financial planning software can help in determining optimal CPP start dates, withdrawal amounts from RSPs and TFSAs, and the overall impact on your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

The key to maximizing tax savings is not just knowing about individual credits but [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | stacking them together]] for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many Canadians are unaware of how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Strategies for Stacking Credits

### Retirement Tax Savings Combo

For [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burdens | retirement tax savings]], individuals can combine the Pension Income Amount with the Age Amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

*   **Pension Income Amount**
    *   Allows a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of eligible pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   Calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   For 2025, it's worth up to $928 federally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Tax Credit**
    *   Canadians aged 65 and older can claim this non-refundable credit to reduce taxes in [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burdens | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
    *   For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   The credit is gradually reduced if net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

**Example:** John and Linda are both retired; John has a large pension, and Linda has a smaller income. Since they are both over 65, they can each claim the Pension Income Amount. John also qualifies for the Age Amount Credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

> Pension income splitting can further increase savings by shifting some of one spouse's income into the other's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo

Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**
    *   Provides tax-free monthly payments to help families with the cost of raising children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   In 2025, parents can receive up to $7,997 per child under six and $6,744 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Payments are income-tested and phase out as family income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**
    *   Allows claims for costs related to daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)**
    *   Provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim up to $8,081 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   For a child under 18 with a disability, the credit amount is up to $8,081 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

**Example:** Sarah and Mike have two young children in daycare, and one child has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   They receive tax-free monthly payments from the Canada Child Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   Mike claims child care expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   They receive an extra tax credit through the Canada Caregiver Amount because one child has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
This combination can lead to thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

> Families can also split income by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Other Stacking Opportunities

*   **Home Accessibility Expenses + Medical Expenses Tax Credit**
    *   Seniors and persons with disabilities can claim up to $20,000 in home renovation expenses to improve accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
    *   Eligible expenses include installing ramps, grab bars, walk-in tubs, or lowering cabinets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   This credit reduces taxes by up to $3,000 (15% of $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> and can be combined with the Medical Expenses Tax Credit for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

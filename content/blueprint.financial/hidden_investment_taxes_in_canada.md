Even for investors who are not actively selling investments, taxes can quietly diminish returns in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Two significant hidden tax costs in Canada are capital gains distributions and foreign withholding taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Capital Gains Distributions

Capital gains distributions can lead to unexpected tax bills, especially when holding mutual funds in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Investors might receive these distributions even without personally selling any assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This occurs when the fund manager sells assets within the fund, triggering capital gains that are then passed on to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These distributions increase taxable income and can result in surprise tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

For instance, if you invest $100,000 in a mutual fund, and the manager realizes $5,000 in capital gains by selling internal stocks, you will receive a tax slip for these gains and must pay taxes on them, even if you did not personally sell anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### How to Avoid Capital Gains Distributions

*   Hold mutual funds within a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) or RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) to avoid capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Utilize Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) instead of mutual funds, as ETFs are generally more [[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax efficient]] and distribute fewer gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Foreign Withholding Taxes

Foreign withholding taxes can result in lost investment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If you invest in US dividend-paying stocks or ETFs within a TFSA, the IRS automatically withholds 15% of your dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This tax is often hidden as it is deducted at the source, meaning investors may not even realize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

For example, if you hold $50,000 of Microsoft stock in your TFSA, earning $1,750 in annual dividends, the IRS will withhold 15% ($262) before you receive the payout, leaving you with only $1,487 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Over 20 years, this could amount to $5,250 in lost dividends that could have been reinvested and compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### How to Avoid Foreign Withholding Taxes

*   Hold US stocks and ETFs in an RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan), where withholding taxes do not apply due to the [[canadian_tax_system | Canada-US tax treaty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Use Canadian-listed ETFs that hold US stocks, as some structures can reduce withholding tax exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

Taxes are one of the most frequently overlooked costs in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. However, making informed account choices can save thousands in unnecessary taxes over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

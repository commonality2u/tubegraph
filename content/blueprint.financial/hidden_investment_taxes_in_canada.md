Even when investors aren't actively selling investments, taxes can quietly diminish returns in unexpected ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Two of the most significant hidden tax costs are capital gains distributions and foreign withholding taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Capital Gains Distributions

When holding mutual funds in a non-registered account, investors might receive unexpected tax bills due to capital gains distributions, even if they haven't personally sold anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This occurs when the fund manager sells assets within the fund, triggering capital gains that are then passed on to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. These distributions increase taxable income and can lead to surprise tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

For instance, if $100,000 is invested in a mutual fund and the manager realizes $5,000 in capital gains by selling stocks inside the fund, the investor will receive a tax slip for those gains and must pay taxes on them, despite not making any personal sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### How to Avoid Capital Gains Distributions

*   Hold mutual funds in a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) or RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) to avoid capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Use ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) instead of mutual funds, as ETFs are typically more [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax efficient]] and distribute fewer gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Foreign Withholding Taxes

Foreign withholding taxes represent lost investment income when investing in US dividend-paying stocks or ETFs within a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. The IRS automatically withholds 15% of these dividends, a truly hidden fee as it's deducted at the source before the investor receives the payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For example, if an investor holds $50,000 of Microsoft stock in their TFSA, earning $1,750 in annual dividends, the IRS would withhold 15% ($262) before the payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This means the investor would only receive approximately $1,487 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Over 20 years, this can add up to $5,250 in lost dividends that could have been reinvested and compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### How to Avoid Foreign Withholding Taxes

*   Hold US stocks and ETFs in an RSP, where withholding taxes do not apply due to the Canada-US tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Use Canadian-listed ETFs that hold US stocks, as some structures can reduce withholding tax exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

Taxes are one of the most overlooked costs in investing, but making appropriate account choices can save thousands in unnecessary taxes over the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

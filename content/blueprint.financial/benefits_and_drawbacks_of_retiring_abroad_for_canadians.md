From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

A significant number of Canadians are choosing to permanently leave the country, with 106,000 departing in 2024. Many are seeking to escape high costs, high taxes, and the concern of outliving their [[effects_of_relocating_on_canadian_retirement_savings_and_benefits | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This has led many to consider [[top_retirement_destinations_for_canadians_seeking_to_stretch_their_pension | retiring abroad]] as a viable alternative for a better quality of life in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Reasons for Considering Retirement Abroad

### High Costs in Canada
Living in Canada, particularly in major cities, is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   The average Canadian retiree receives approximately $1,300 to $1,500 per month from [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]] and [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] if starting at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
*   In Toronto, a one-bedroom apartment averages about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Modest monthly living expenses in Toronto, including rent, utilities, and groceries, can easily exceed $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Numbeo estimates that a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month *without* rent, bringing the total for a modest lifestyle to $3,500 to $4,000 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]] and [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] combined barely cover a third of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This financial strain often leads Canadians to delay retirement or seek options abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto
A financial simulation for 'Seth', retiring in 2025 at age 65 with $281,000 in net worth, demonstrates the challenges of [[tax_implications_for_retiring_alone_in_canada | retiring alone in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>:
*   Seth spends $50,000 annually, with $18,000 covered by [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]] and [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The rest comes from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   By age 70, his TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals (over $46,000 annually), incurring effective tax rates above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   By age 74, he is out of savings, and by 76, his net worth turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This highlights how a high-cost city like Toronto can quickly deplete even a decent nest egg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Benefits of Retiring Abroad

Many Canadians are moving to countries where their money goes further, allowing them to live decently on a modest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Lower Cost of Living
*   **Mexico**: A top choice for its warmth, affordability, and proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Cancun's monthly living cost for a single person, including rent, is about $1,700 Canadian, or $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   **Seth's Outcome in Cancun**: With the same savings as in Toronto, Seth's lower living costs allow [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]] and [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] to cover most expenses, leading to portfolio growth. By age 90, his net worth could exceed $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Portugal**: Offers a European lifestyle with a relatively affordable cost of living for Western Europe, falling between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Porto's total monthly expenses (rent + living) are around $3,000 Canadian, similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   **Seth's Outcome in Portugal**: Spending $36,000 annually, Seth's savings drop to $199,000 by age 75 and deplete by age 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. While better than Toronto, it still wasn't enough for a long retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Small adjustments, like delaying [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]] to age 70, could extend savings by a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Thailand**: Offers excellent value. A full lifestyle in Chiang Mai, including rent, food, and leisure, can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Paraguay**: Known for its low cost and favorable tax system. Living expenses in Asunción are about $628 per month, with one-bedroom rent around $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Spain**: Offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines and world-class food. Monthly living costs in Alicante are around $1,570, with one-bedroom rent at $1,300, bringing total monthly expenses to $2,400-$2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Quality Healthcare
*   **Mexico**: Private clinics are modern, affordable, and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper than in Canada (e.g., 20% of the price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Portugal**: Healthcare is excellent. Residents can access the public system, and private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Thailand**: Healthcare is modern, affordable, and widely regarded as some of the best in Asia. Many doctors speak English, and private hospitals often exceed expectations for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Spain**: Healthcare is excellent, though affordable private insurance is required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Visa Accessibility
*   **Mexico**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 Canadian in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Portugal**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring about €870 per month (approx. $1,400 Canadian) in steady income from sources like [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]], pensions, or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Thailand**: A retirement visa requires applicants to be 50 or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (approx. $33,000 Canadian) in a bank, which must be transferred to a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Paraguay**: Offers ways to obtain a permanent residency visa with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Spain**: The non-lucrative visa requires about $40,000-$45,000 Canadian per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Tax Advantages
*   **Paraguay**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]], [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]], RIFs, or pensions is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Drawbacks and Challenges of Retiring Abroad

Despite the benefits, there are several considerations and potential drawbacks when retiring abroad.

### Safety and Infrastructure
*   **Mexico**: Safety can be a big concern depending on the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Infrastructure can also be inconsistent in smaller towns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Bureaucracy and Language Barriers
*   Dealing with bureaucracy in new countries often requires significant patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Some knowledge of the local language (e.g., Spanish in Mexico) helps significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Distance from family, adapting to new systems, and language barriers can be extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Healthcare for Foreigners
*   **Mexico**: Public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners, making private insurance essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Spain**: Affordable private insurance is required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS) Pitfall
A critical rule often overlooked is the impact on [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>:
*   To qualify for [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] while living in Canada, only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   However, to continue receiving [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] long-term while living *outside* Canada, 20 years of residency are required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency and move abroad, you might only receive [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   **Example**: David, 67, with 15 years of Canadian residency, moved to Thailand. His [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] stopped after 6 months because Thailand doesn't have a social security agreement with Canada, and he didn't meet the 20-year mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   It is crucial to understand these [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | important tax and residency rules]] before moving to avoid losing income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Financial Risks
*   Relying solely on [[implications_for_canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits_abroad | CPP]] and [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare surprises can severely impact a budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Planning for Retirement Abroad
*   Utilize tools like Numbeo to compare costs like rent, food, and utilities in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   A low-cost retirement can be rewarding but requires a solid financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   Relocating internationally involves complex [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax and residency rules]] and significant financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Professional advice can help map out costs, taxes, and potential contingencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

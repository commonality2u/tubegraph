Retirees often face a dilemma: how much to spend versus how much to keep in savings each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This shift from decades of saving to spending can feel uncomfortable, as many struggle to move from a scarcity mindset to an abundance mindset where they confidently use what they've saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This [[Save or Spend Dilemma for Retirees | save or spend dilemma]] is very common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough in Retirement Can Be a Bad Thing

Hesitating to spend in retirement can lead to several negative outcomes:

### Missed Experiences and Opportunities
Retirees who are reluctant to spend may miss out on significant experiences such as travel, hobbies, or healthcare improvements that could enhance their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. These are the moments that truly make retirement fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

### Healthspan Versus Lifespan
Dr. Peter Attia's book, *Outlive*, highlights the distinction between lifespan and healthspan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. While lifespan is the total number of years lived, healthspan refers to the years spent in good healthâ€”active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities might decline before enjoyment of savings can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### Inflation's Impact
[[Impact of inflation on retiree purchasing power | Inflation]] does not wait and can erode the value of your money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. However, this is primarily a concern if your retirement plan is not properly structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. A well-planned retirement should account for [[planning_for_inflation_and_rising_costs | inflation]] to ensure your [[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | purchasing power]] remains intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough in Retirement Can Be a Good Thing
While under-spending can have drawbacks, it also offers benefits:

*   **Encourages Cautious Spending**: Hesitation to spend promotes thoughtful and deliberate financial decisions, preventing impulse purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Helps Money Last (Reducing Longevity Risk)**: A careful approach ensures savings stretch further, reducing the risk of running out of money prematurely, which is a common concern for most retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk (Sequence of Returns Risk)**: Cautious spending helps protect against market losses, especially those occurring early in retirement, which can drain a portfolio faster than later losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
*   **Aligns with Legacy Goals**: For many, leaving a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes is a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Being cautious with spending allows retirees to achieve these legacy goals while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance
One of the biggest challenges for retirees is not knowing how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. It's natural to err on the side of caution to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. However, this approach might prevent them from enjoying the wealth they worked hard to build, even when it's possible to achieve all financial goals and still spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

A well-structured financial plan is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. By clearly outlining affordable spending levels and stress-testing investment portfolios, retirees can move from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. For instance, Michael and Karen, aged 66 and 64, with a combined income of $180,000, expenses of $70,000, and $4 million in savings, were hesitant to increase spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. A plan showed they could withdraw an additional $140,000 annually, well above their current spending, to support luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Stress-testing their portfolio for a 30% decline and longevity projections to age 95 confirmed their financial sustainability even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

For those with substantial portfolios, developing strict saving habits can make it difficult to transition to spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Easing into spending by setting small, meaningful goals like trips or new hobbies can help gradually shift this mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

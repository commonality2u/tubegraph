Many Canadian retirees can significantly reduce their tax bill by strategically managing their [[managing_rsp_withdrawals_for_tax_savings_in_retirement | RSP withdrawals]] and utilizing their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This [[using_tfsa_wisely_with_rrsp | RSP to TFSA tactic]] aims to [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burdens | reduce taxes]], boost tax-free growth, and enhance retirement comfort by keeping more of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Problem: Wasted TFSA Room and Excess RSP Balances

A common mistake among retirees is leaving money on the table due to improper [[managing_rsp_withdrawals_for_tax_savings_in_retirement | RSP withdrawals]] and unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Underutilized TFSA Potential
Despite the [[maximizing_the_benefits_of_your_TFSA | incredible tax-free growth potential]] of the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>:
*   Only 1.54 million out of 17.77 million Canadians who hold a TFSA manage to max out their contributions, representing just 8.66% of Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   Many retirees enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, peaking at 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The Challenge of Excess RSP Balances
While RSPs are excellent for saving during working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:
*   Every dollar withdrawn from an RSP is taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Upon turning 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requires conversion of RSPs into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) and mandates withdrawals, regardless of whether the money is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## The Strategy: RSP to TFSA Tactic

If you don't need all the money from your mandatory RSP/RRIF withdrawals, contribute any excess funds into your TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This can save thousands in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan
Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RRIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA requires him to withdraw $30,000 annually, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Since Eddie is in a 30% tax bracket, he owes $9,000 in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Eddie only needs $11,000 for living expenses, as his CPP, OAS benefits, and work pensions cover most of his costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RRIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Instead of putting this excess income into a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

#### Growth Comparison Over 10 Years (Assuming 6% Annual Growth)

*   **Using TFSA**:
    *   Eddie consistently contributes $10,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
    *   After 10 years, his total contributions are $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   The TFSA grows to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

*   **Using a Non-Registered Account**:
    *   If Eddie invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would still grow at 6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   However, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, reducing the effective growth rate to around 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   After 10 years, the non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

*   **Using a Taxable Savings Account**:
    *   If the money were placed in a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the growth would be significantly lower, potentially closer to $55,000 over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways
By contributing his excess RRIF income to his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Achieves a TFSA balance of $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, or even less in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Maximizes his retirement savings and gains the flexibility to use his TFSA funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Pro Tips for [[Optimizing TFSA RRSP and FHSA in Canada | Optimizing Your Accounts]]

*   **Prioritize TFSA over Taxable Accounts**: Always prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a portion of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Avoid Large RSP Withdrawals in High-Income Years**: Do not withdraw large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This helps in [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | minimizing RRSP tax burdens]].

## Does This Eliminate RSP Taxes?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | RSP withdrawals]] will still be considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

However, by [[using_tfsa_and_rrsp_together_for_tax_savings | strategically combining RSP withdrawals]] with TFSA contributions, you can:
*   Reduce your taxable income in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Potentially avoid additional penalties like OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The key is to [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burdens | minimize the tax impact]] while [[maximizing_tfsa_contributions_for_taxfree_growth | maximizing your overall retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Your retirement savings should be working for you, not the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Many Canadians believe that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, for those who rely heavily on these benefits, it is often a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Relying solely on CPP and OAS can lead to a barebones lifestyle, making it difficult to enjoy one's golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## How Much CPP and OAS Can You Expect?

While retirement income typically comes from multiple sources, it's important to understand the amounts received from CPP and OAS if these are your only financial pillars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The CPP is based on your lifetime earnings and contributions; higher contributions generally lead to a larger payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Most people do not receive the [[maximum_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_different_scenarios | maximum amount]] as it requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Here's an overview of [[2025_cpp_payment_schedule_and_cost_of_living_adjustments | 2025 CPP payouts]] at different starting ages:
*   **Starting at 60**:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   Maximum monthly payment: About $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Starting at 65**:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Starting at 70**:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $2,340 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

[[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | Delaying your CPP]] significantly increases your monthly payment; waiting until age 70 can boost benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. CPP is designed to replace about 25% to 33% of your working income, which can be a good rule of thumb for [[how_to_estimate_your_cpp_benefits | estimating your CPP benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For more details on [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | maximizing CPP benefits]], additional resources are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS)

The OAS pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not tied to employment income or work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and deferral choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

[[maximum_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_different_scenarios | OAS maximum monthly payments]] as of March 2025:
*   **Age 65-74**: Approximately $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Age 75 and older**: Approximately $800 (a 10% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

If your total income is very low, you may qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), which is designed to assist low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   The maximum GIS for 2024 is $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   GIS is reduced dollar-for-dollar by any additional income, and even small RRSP withdrawals can impact eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   Notably, OAS does not count toward GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Total Estimated Income

For someone with no other income sources, a potential total monthly income might look like this:
*   CPP: ~$800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   OAS: ~$700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   GIS: ~$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total**: ~$2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>

This $2,000 per month is barely above the poverty line, indicating that relying on CPP, OAS, and GIS alone is not a comfortable retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Cost of Living Breakdown

Living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada is technically possible but requires serious sacrifices and is generally not comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Major Expenses

*   **Housing**:
    *   **Owning a home outright**: Costs are lower, but you still need to budget for property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, which can be $500 or more per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **Renting**: Even in smaller cities, rent can be a minimum of $1,000 per month, potentially consuming over half of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. In major cities like Toronto or Vancouver, rents for a one-bedroom can easily exceed $2,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: With rising grocery prices, a basic budget for a single senior is about $300 to $500 per month. Eating out frequently is likely not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs**: If under 65 and without provincial plan coverage, private insurance may be needed. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be significant expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: This includes electricity, heating, internet, and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership (insurance, gas, maintenance) can add $200 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Public transit typically costs at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations

Living on a limited income means significant lifestyle restrictions:
*   **No Travel Budget**: Even domestic trips would require substantial saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **No Big Purchases**: Furniture, appliances, or a new car are likely out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund**: You would likely be living month-to-month, making unexpected bills (e.g., medical, car repair, home maintenance) financially disruptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. You may need to rely on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Reality Check: Is It Enough?

For most people, the short answer is no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### When It Could Work

Living on CPP and OAS alone is challenging but might be possible under specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>:
*   **Owning Your Home Outright**: Eliminates mortgage or rent payments, drastically lowering expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners also have options like borrowing against their home or downsizing to free up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Living in a Low-Cost Area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can help stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Extra Support**: Help from family, investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For instance, a mortgage-free retiree in a small town in Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work, but only with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When It Falls Apart

For most retirees, relying solely on CPP and OAS is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:
*   **Major City Costs**: The high cost of living in major cities makes it nearly impossible to survive on this income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **No Savings**: Without emergency funds, each month becomes a precarious financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement constantly worrying about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## What Can You Do if CPP and OAS Aren't Enough?

If your government benefits won't cover your expenses, there are several [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | ways to bridge the gap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>:

*   **Delay CPP and OAS**: Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP can grow by 42% and OAS by 36% through delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Part-time Work or Delaying Retirement**: Working longer or taking on part-time work can help ensure your money lasts throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**: Downsizing your home frees up capital, and relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or abroad can make your money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Government Benefits**: Explore other programs like the Allowance for the Survivor, which provides additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning**: Strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower your tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Creative Ways to Make It Work

Some retirees with limited income have found innovative solutions:
*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming housesitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Turning Hobbies into Income**: Monetizing skills through teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Programs like Trusted Housesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend involves slow traveling through low-cost countries, utilizing extended tourist visas to live for months at a time in places where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal can offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This option is most common among active and healthy retirees in their 60s or early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Planning for Your Retirement

If you are relying only on CPP and OAS, a backup plan is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The sooner you plan, the more options you will have to address potential shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Retirement planning is similar to a medical checkup: early diagnosis of a problem provides more options for a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. If you are still working, now is the time to create a plan to avoid solely relying on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

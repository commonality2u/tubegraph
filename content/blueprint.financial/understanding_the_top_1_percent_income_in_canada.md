This article explores what it takes to be part of the top 1% of income earners and net worth holders in Canada, drawing on data from Statistics Canada and the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO).

## Defining the Top 1% Income in Canada

As of 2021, to be considered in the top 1% of income earners in Canada, an individual needs to cross a specific threshold. The [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | threshold value]] for the top 1% income in Canada was $271,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This is distinct from the median income of the top 1%, which was $378,900 per year in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Median vs. Threshold
> The median income of the top 1% represents the middle point of income within that group, effectively the top 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The threshold value, conversely, is the minimum income required to enter the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This distinction is crucial for a clear [[comparison_of_median_and_average_incomes_in_canadas_top_earners | comparison of median and average incomes]] among Canada's top earners.

Key characteristics of individuals in the top 1% income bracket include:
*   Approximately 80% are married or in common-law relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Wages and salaries accounted for 63.1% of their income in 2021, a slight increase from 62.7% in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This suggests that about one-third of their income derives from sources other than their primary employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Defining the Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

Net worth, calculated as total assets minus liabilities, is considered by some to be a more accurate measure of true wealth than income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. A 2021 report from the PBO indicated that the [[income_thresholds_for_top_10_5_and_1_percent_earners_in_canada | threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth]] in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Approximately 160,000 families in Canada have achieved this level of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Pathways to Reaching the Top 1%

Individuals and families typically achieve top 1% status through a combination of approaches, including:

### 1. High-Paying Professions
Having a profession that yields a very high income is a direct path to the top 1% income bracket and can contribute significantly to accumulating the net worth required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Professions that can reach or exceed the income threshold of $271,600 per year include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
*   C-Suite level executives (CEO, CFO, CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Medical specialists (e.g., cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Partners in law firms and accounting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Investment bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Principal software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Senior data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
*   Specialized dentists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
*   Senior software architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

These roles typically require many years of specialized education and work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 2. Starting a Business
Business ownership is a primary method for the top 1% to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Successful entrepreneurs, like Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify, have amassed significant wealth through scaling their businesses to reach a large customer base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Business ownership offers financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits such as selling the business or going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Certain sales roles, such as real estate agents, mortgage brokers, or pharmaceutical sales representatives, can also achieve top 1% incomes through commissions and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### 3. Investing
Strategic investing is crucial for growing wealth and reaching the top 1% net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It allows money to compound and grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Examples like Anne Scheiber, who built a $22 million fortune by investing in Blue Chip stocks and holding them long-term, highlight the power of this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Recommended [[strategies_to_achieve_top_1_percent_income | investment strategies]] for beginners include:
*   **Diversification**: Spreading investments across different asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Stock Market**: Investing in index funds or ETFs for broad diversification and low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Fixed Income/Bonds**: Complementing stocks with bonds to reduce risk and provide steady growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: A popular wealth builder in Canada, especially rental properties, offering steady income and property value appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Utilizing Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), and First Home Savings Accounts (FHSAs) to enhance investment returns through tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### 4. Frugality and Saving
Living frugally and consistently saving a significant portion of income can lead to substantial wealth accumulation over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. The story of Ronald Reed, a janitor who built an $8 million fortune by living below his means and investing in Blue Chip stocks, illustrates that a high income is not always necessary if consistent saving and wise investing are practiced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

It's important to balance frugality with [[lifestyle_and_financial_strategies_of_high_earners_in_canada | maintaining quality of life and relationships]], avoiding "extreme frugality" that could negatively impact well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Most individuals who achieve top 1% status employ a combination of these methods, tailoring their approach to their individual circumstances and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

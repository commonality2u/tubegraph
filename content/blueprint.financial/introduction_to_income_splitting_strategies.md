[[income_splitting_strategies_in_canada | Income splitting]] can be a complex but highly effective strategy for managing taxes for couples, potentially leading to significant savings, with some individuals saving over six figures in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's often viewed as a carefully choreographed dance between partners, where harmony is key to avoiding higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The strategies range from simpler to more complex approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Strategies for Income Splitting

### 1. Using Your FHSA (First Home Savings Account)

This [[income_splitting_strategies_for_couples | income splitting strategy for couples]] is particularly useful when one partner has unused FHSA contribution room and the other has maxed out their tax-advantaged accounts like an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The FHSA offers tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

**How it Works:**
A partner who has maxed out their tax-advantaged accounts can gift money to their partner who hasn't used their FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This avoids investing the money in a taxable non-registered account and allows the receiving partner to gain a tax deduction and benefit from tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted & Robin):** Ted, who has maxed out his registered accounts, gifts $8,000 to Robin, who hasn't contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   **Without FHSA:** Ted would invest $8,000 in a taxable account, paying $132 annually on $400 growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
    *   **With FHSA:** Robin contributes $8,000 to her FHSA, gains a $2,400 immediate tax deduction, and avoids taxes on $400 in investment growth, leading to a total saving of $2,532 plus future tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

**Pros:**
*   **Double Benefit:** One partner avoids taxable investment growth, while the other gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals:** Withdrawals are tax-free when used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** If not used for a home, the FHSA can be rolled over into an RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

**Cons:**
*   **Eligibility:** The receiving partner must not have owned a home in the past four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Ownership Risk:** Gifted funds legally belong to the receiving partner, making them difficult to reclaim if the partnership ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### 2. [[employersponsored_pension_income_splitting | Employer-Sponsored Pension Income Splitting]]

[[pension_income_splitting | Pension income splitting]] allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse, reducing the overall household tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This section specifically addresses employer-sponsored pensions, not CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

**Eligibility Rules:**
*   **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP):** Income from a DBPP qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] prior to age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP):** Withdrawals from a DCPP generally do not qualify before age 65, unless specific rules apply (e.g., spouse's passing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After Age 65:** Both DBPP and DCPP income are eligible for [[pension_income_splitting | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Withdrawals from RIFs and LIFs also become eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted & Robin):** Ted, retired and in his 60s, earns $40,000 annually from his pension (30% tax rate), while Robin has low income (15% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   By splitting 20% of Ted's pension income to Robin, they save $3,000 in taxes overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### 3. Spousal RRSP Contributions

This is a simple yet effective way to share the tax load in [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The higher-income spouse contributes to an RRSP in the lower-income spouse's name, receiving an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. When the lower-income spouse withdraws funds in retirement, they are taxed at their lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted & Robin):** Ted earns $120,000 annually (35% tax rate), and Robin earns $40,000 (20% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Ted contributes $12,000 to a spousal RRSP in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   **Immediate Deduction:** Ted's contribution saves him $4,200 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Future Tax Efficiency:** Robin's withdrawal of funds is taxed at her lower 20% rate, paying $2,400 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This results in a net saving of $1,800 in household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

*   **Pro Tips:**
    *   **Avoid Early Withdrawals:** If funds are withdrawn within 3 years of contribution, the amount is attributed back to the contributing spouse and taxed at their higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
    *   **Plan for Equal Balances:** Aim for equal RRSP balances to avoid uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   **Consider Age Differences:** If one spouse is significantly younger, plan contributions to ensure balanced withdrawals during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### 4. [[cpp_income_splitting | Splitting CPP Income]]

For couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, [[cpp_income_splitting | income splitting]] is an easy way to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Up to 50% of CPP benefits can be shifted from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse, reducing the household tax bill and potentially helping to avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted & Robin):** Ted receives $12,000 annually in CPP benefits (30% tax rate), and Robin receives $6,000 (15% tax rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   By splitting $3,000 of Ted's CPP income to Robin, they save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This lowers their overall tax bill by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### 5. Splitting Capital Losses

Capital losses can be transferred to a spouse to offset their capital gains using the Superficial Loss Rule, reducing the household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

**How it Works (Steps):**
1.  Sell shares at a loss in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
2.  Your spouse buys the same shares within 30 days (before or after your sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
3.  The loss is denied to you but added to your spouse's adjusted cost basis (ACB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
4.  Your spouse must hold the shares for at least 30 days after the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Example (Ted & Robin):** Ted has a $4,000 capital loss, while Robin has $15,000 in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   Ted sells shares, incurring a $4,000 loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   Robin purchases the same shares within 30 days, triggering the Superficial Loss rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   Ted's loss is denied but added to Robin's cost base. When Robin eventually sells those shares, the $4,000 loss effectively offsets her taxable gains, reducing their overall household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip:** This strategy only works for non-registered accounts, requiring good record-keeping of adjusted cost bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### 6. Investment Loans for Your Spouse or Child (Prescribed Rate Loan)

A prescribed rate loan can be a strategic way to reduce a family's overall tax bills, though it comes with challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

**How it Works:**
A high-income spouse or family member lends money to a lower-income spouse or child at the CRA's prescribed interest rate (e.g., 5% at the time of transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The borrower invests the money, and any investment income is taxed at their lower rate instead of the lender's higher one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.

**Risks:**
*   Potential for poor investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Possibility of increased prescribed rates in the future, reducing the strategy's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

*It is highly recommended to proceed with professional guidance before attempting this strategy* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

### 7. Family Trusts

A Family Trust in Canada is a legal arrangement where a trustee holds assets for beneficiaries, typically family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. It offers several [[income_splitting_to_reduce_tax_burden | tax-saving strategies to reduce tax burden]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

**Benefits:**
*   **Income Splitting Potential:** Income can be distributed to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets, potentially reducing the overall family tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Multiply Capital Gains Exemptions:** Allocating capital gains to multiple beneficiaries allows each to utilize their lifetime capital gains exemption, leading to significant tax savings when selling qualified small business shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Estate Freezing:** Transferring future growth of assets to beneficiaries can minimize taxes upon death by capping the value subject to capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

*Family trusts are a very complicated procedure and typically require the hiring of lawyers and accountants* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Combining Income Splitting Strategies

The true power of [[income_splitting_strategies_in_canada | income splitting]] emerges when various strategies are combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. They act like a well-stocked toolbox, where each tool serves a purpose, but together they build a solid financial foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

*   **Example of Combination:** A couple could contribute to an FHSA for one partner to claim a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Then, they could use [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]] in retirement to balance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Adding spousal RRSP contributions can create even more tax-deferred savings, further reducing household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

These strategies can work seamlessly to lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals like saving for a home or planning for a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

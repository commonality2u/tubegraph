There is a common misconception that accepting a raise might result in taking home less money due to moving into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This idea is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Common Misconception

Consider a scenario where an individual earning $56,000 is offered a raise to $60,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They might hesitate to accept, believing that their current [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]] of 15% will entirely shift to 20.5% once their income crosses $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This leads to the incorrect assumption that they would end up with less take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

> An employee earning $56,000 is offered a raise to $60,000. They decline, stating, "My current [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]] is 15%, but once I cross $57,375 in income, I'll be bumped into the 20.5% tax bracket. So, I figured I'd end up taking home less money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## How Progressive Tax Systems Work

This belief misunderstands how [[misconceptions_about_income_tax | Canadian taxes]] operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Canada employs a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. In a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]], different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates.

Any income earned below that threshold is still subject to the lower 15% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

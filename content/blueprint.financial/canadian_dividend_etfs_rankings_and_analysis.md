## Top 5 Canadian Dividend ETFs

### 5. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

XDV is designed for investors seeking steady, high-quality dividends from some of Canada's strongest companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, selecting stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Key Features**
    *   **Strong Dividend Payers:** Holds 31 of the highest-yielding Canadian stocks, carefully selected for dividend consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions:** Provides monthly payouts, making it ideal for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   **Financials Heavy:** Nearly 60% of the ETF is composed of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs**
    *   **Dividend Yield:** Approximately 4.2% as of January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024):** 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   **Management Expense Ratio (MER):** 0.55% per year, which is higher than some alternatives but not unreasonable for a high-yield strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   **Assets Under Management (AUM):** $1.76 billion, indicating its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings:** Dominated by Canadian financials (nearly 60%), including Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These companies have strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Who Should Invest:** Great for retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts and exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Who Should NOT Invest:** Not ideal for growth investors, as its focus is on income over capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Verdict:** XDV is a solid pick for dividend investors wanting monthly income and exposure to stable, high-yield Canadian companies, but note its heavy reliance on financial stocks and moderate fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

ZWC is an income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks while using a covered call strategy to enhance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy leads to higher monthly dividends but with very limited upside potential in stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **How Covered Calls Work:** ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks, earning extra income (premiums) in exchange for capping potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If stock prices remain flat or fall, ZWC keeps the premium as profit, boosting its dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, if stock prices rise above the strike price, ZWC must sell at the set price, missing out on bigger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. In essence, ZWC trades growth potential for more stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Enhanced Income Strategy:** Uses covered calls to generate extra income, leading to a higher-than-average yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions:** Ideal for retirees or income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **Diversified Canadian Portfolio:** Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs**
    *   **Dividend Yield:** Very high at 6.62% as of February 27, 2025, due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024):** 12% return, but the 5-year average is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   **MER:** 0.72%, higher than traditional dividend ETFs due to active options management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   **Trading Expense Ratio (TER):** 0.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Total Cost:** 0.92%, making it the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   **AUM:** $1.7 billion, making it very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings:** Heavily weighted towards financials and energy, including Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. These are stable, high-yield dividend payers, but the covered call strategy caps growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Who Should Invest:** Best for retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Good for RSP and TFSA investors who do not need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Who Should NOT Invest:** Not ideal for growth-focused investors, as covered calls limit potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Verdict:** ZWC is a strong choice for investors wanting high monthly income with reduced market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Its covered call strategy limits upside potential, making it better suited for purely income-focused investors rather than long-term growth seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. A TFSA could be a great place to hold this ETF to shield high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### 3. iShares S&P/TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)

CDZ invests in Canadian companies that have increased their dividends every year for at least five consecutive years (known as "dividend aristocrats") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It's a solid choice for those seeking stable dividend growth and monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

    *   **Broad Diversification:** Holds 91 stocks across multiple sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions:** Ideal for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs**
    *   **Dividend Yield:** 3.79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024):** 20.07% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   **MER:** 0.66% per year, slightly higher than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   **AUM:** Just shy of $1 billion, at $940 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings:** Less concentrated in financials compared to other dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Top holdings include BCE, Allied Properties REIT, Fiera Capital, Telus, and Southb Corp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This diversification helps reduce risk compared to bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Who Should Invest:** Great for dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Potentially more diversified than other bank-heavy dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Who Should NOT Invest:** Not ideal for maximum yield seekers due to its lower dividend rates compared to some other ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Verdict:** CDZ is a great choice for long-term investors who value steady dividend growth and broad sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Its focus on companies with strong dividend track records makes it a reliable option for sustainable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip:** For all ETFs on this list, setting up a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) can help supercharge long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### 2. Vanguard FTSE Canadian High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VDY)

VDY is designed for investors seeking a high dividend income from Canada's largest dividend-paying stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Top holdings include RBC, TD, CNR, Enbridge, and Bank of Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. These top 10 holdings make up 70.6% of the fund, making it highly concentrated in a few major sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Who Should Invest:** Great for dividend investors looking for strong, stable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Best for those comfortable with significant financials and energy sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Who Should NOT Invest:** Not ideal for diversification seekers, as over 85% is in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Verdict:** VDY is a strong, low-cost option for investors focused on high monthly dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. While it lacks sector diversification, its focus on Canada's largest dividend payers makes it a great fit for income-seeking investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### 1. iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XEI)

XEI is the top pick because it prioritizes high-quality dividend stocks with strong financials and a track record of steady or growing payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. It is also the lowest-cost ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

While it lacks sector diversification, its focus on financially strong companies and low fees makes it attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Why Canadian Dividend ETFs Are Not Always Preferred Overall

While ETFs are generally a good investment vehicle, Canadian dividend ETFs often come with several downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, limiting their appeal as part of broad [[investment_strategies_using_dividend_etfs_in_canada | investment strategies]].

### Higher Fees

Dividend ETFs often have higher-than-average MERs, which can significantly eat into returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. For instance, XDV charges a 0.55% MER for holding only 31 stocks, which is not great diversification for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. A $1,000 investment in XDV would incur $5.50 in fees per year, which compounds and reduces long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. To counteract this, investors should seek lower MER dividend ETFs, like the top two on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Less Diversification Than Expected

Most Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. VDY, for example, has over 85% exposure to just financials and energy, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. XDV holds only 31 stocks, and XEI holds only 20, meaning they do not offer broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In contrast, a truly diversified ETF like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies, areas where Canadian dividend ETFs are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. If true diversification is sought, dividend ETFs alone might not suffice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Investors might be better off building their own portfolio or choosing a globally diversified ETF like VGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. For more information on alternatives, consider [[how_to_choose_the_right_allinone_etf | All-in-One ETFs in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

### US Dividend Stocks May Be a Better Option

Many of the best dividend stocks are found in the US market, offering higher dividend growth rates, potentially more sector diversification, and more blue-chip companies with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might benefit more from directly investing in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Another strategy could be combining a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

**Pro Tip for US Dividend Stocks:** Consider holding US dividend stocks in an RSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) rather than a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) to avoid withholding tax on the dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool for those who prefer not to buy individual dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, they are not without their drawbacks. [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | High fees]], lack of diversification, and reduced control over individual holdings are real concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Investors should carefully consider these factors when evaluating [[alternatives_to_canadian_dividend_etfs_for_investors | alternatives to Canadian dividend ETFs for investors]].

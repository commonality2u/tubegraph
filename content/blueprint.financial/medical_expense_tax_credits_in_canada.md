Going to the doctor or dentist can be difficult, but paying the bill, even with Canada's supposedly free healthcare, can be even more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Fortunately, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to claim some of these costs on their taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide outlines five common medical expenses you might not realize are eligible for a claim, helping you retain more of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) enables Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. To claim it, expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return:
*   Line 33099: For expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Line 33199: For expenses of other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Example: Jessica's Claim
Jessica earns $50,000 annually and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her $50,000 income is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,500 = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, which reduces her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Common Medical Expenses You Can Claim

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications
The CRA allows you to claim eligible prescription drugs and medications as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. These must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Over-the-counter medications like vitamins and supplements do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Medical marijuana is covered if you have a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase it from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

#### Example: Sarah's Medication Claim
Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   3% of her $60,000 income is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $3,000 - $1,800 = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Keep track of pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care
Many dental and vision expenses are tax deductible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. You can claim eligible expenses for services provided by licensed professionals, including dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Covered expenses include routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Purely cosmetic procedures, such as teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses, do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

#### Example: Alex's Dental and Vision Claim
Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   3% of his $150,000 income is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   The set threshold for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 from his total expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   His eligible claim is $3,100 - $2,759 = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

> [!TIP] Timing Major Procedures
> Higher-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures, like laser eye surgery and a root canal, within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Medical Travel Expenses
If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services unavailable near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Eligible travel expenses include:
*   **Public transportation**: Bus, train, taxi, flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Vehicle expenses**: Fuel, parking, maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Lodging**: Hotel stay or Airbnb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Meals**: When required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

#### Example: Jennifer's Travel Claim
Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. She spent $800 on gas and parking, and $1,500 on meals and accommodations, totaling $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   3% of her $55,000 income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,300 - $1,650 = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
Jennifer can claim $650 in medical travel expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

> [!TIP] Assisted Travel
> If a medical practitioner certifies you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums
If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This includes plans that cover medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Employer-paid premiums generally do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed if they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

#### Example: Mark's Insurance Claim
Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   3% of his income is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   His eligible claim is $3,500 - $2,700 = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment
Many costly medical devices and equipment qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This can include:
*   Wheelchairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>
*   Hearing aids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Insulin pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   CPAP machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   Prosthetics and orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
*   In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

Some medical devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify, so keep records of both the prescription and the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Ongoing maintenance costs, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

#### Example: Emily's CPAP Machine Claim
Emily earns $65,000 and purchased a CPAP machine for $2,500 for her sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   3% of her $65,000 income is $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,950 = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
Emily can claim $550 on her return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

> [!TIP] Check CRA's List
> If making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it is on the CRA's list of eligible medical devices to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

If you have a family, properly claiming medical expenses can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Knowing who should claim them can significantly impact your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Example: Richard and Pauline's Family Claim
Richard and Pauline, a Canadian couple with two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), had the following medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   Richard: $2,500
*   Pauline: $2,000
*   Jen (16): $1,800
*   Rob (19): $1,300
*   **Total**: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard's and Pauline's, making $6,300 eligible for line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Rob's expenses must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Let's compare their eligible claims:
*   **Pauline**: Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Her eligible claim is $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Richard**: Earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. His eligible claim is $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [!TIP] Lowest Income Earner
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction for combined medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

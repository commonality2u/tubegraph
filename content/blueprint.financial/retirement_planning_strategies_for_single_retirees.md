Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are approaching retirement alone, representing a significant 37.8% of this demographic who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This demographic shift necessitates a distinct approach to [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial planning for retirees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Planning to retire solo requires specific strategies to avoid common financial pitfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Financial Realities for Single Canadian Seniors

The average retirement income in Canada for singles is considerably lower than for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older was $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) for couples, but only $30,820 per year (approximately $2,568 per month) for single seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This means single seniors earn less than 50% of what couples do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Unique Risks for Single Retirees

Retiring alone presents unique financial challenges, as there is no partner to split costs, share benefits, or provide a safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Singles often face higher taxes, less government support, and greater pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money (Longevity and Investment Risk)
This is a primary concern for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Couples share expenses and benefit from tax savings, whereas singles must cover all costs alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Single retirees do not have a partner's pension or extra savings to depend on, and they often require more savings to maintain the same lifestyle as couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

#### Strategies to Mitigate:
*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: Adhere to a sustainable withdrawal rate, such as the 4% rule, potentially adjusting it lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Diversified Investments**: Diversify investments with a mix of growth (stocks) and safety (bonds, GICs) to ensure funds last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Careful Financial Planning**: Work with a financial planner to build a customized [[financial_planning_for_retirees | strategy]] based on individual lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Every decision, from when to take CPP to withdrawal amounts, is more critical for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden
Being single in retirement in Canada can lead to a higher tax burden, as singles lack access to [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] or spousal benefits, often placing them in higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income might pay $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income, due to the couple's ability to split income and qualify for full OAS and age credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

#### Strategies to Mitigate:
*   **Smart Withdrawal Decisions**: The timing and method of withdrawing from RRSPs, TFSAs, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the amount of money retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Smart timing and drawdown [[strategies for maximizing retirement income | strategies]] can save thousands in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs
Inflation silently erodes purchasing power, and single retirees have no one to share the burden of rising costs for essentials like groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Planning for inflation is essential, especially for a retirement that could last 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

#### Strategies to Mitigate:
*   **Downsizing/Renting Out Space**: Unlock home equity by downsizing or renting out extra space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Co-living/House Hacking**: Explore co-living arrangements with friends or house hacking to reduce fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocation**: Consider moving to lower-cost provinces or countries to stretch retirement dollars further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits
A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the absence of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there are no automatic rollovers for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death, which can lead to a substantial tax hit on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited support for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

#### Strategies to Mitigate:
*   **Careful RRSP/RIF Withdrawals**: Plan RRSP and RIF withdrawals carefully; gradual withdrawals can reduce the final tax burden on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review**: Ensure beneficiaries for RRSPs, TFSAs, and insurance policies are up to date to ensure assets are distributed as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support
Loneliness can pose a financial risk for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies indicate that single retirees are more susceptible to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Scammers frequently target older adults who live alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

#### Strategies to Mitigate:
*   **Community Engagement**: Join community groups, volunteer, participate in social clubs, or take classes to stay engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Co-living**: Consider co-living arrangements with other retirees, such as senior co-housing or shared housing, to cut costs and foster friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Tech for Safety**: Utilize technology features like Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts for personal safety and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Financial Awareness**: Stay informed and secure about personal finances, especially if living alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### 6. [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | Health and Long-Term Care Costs]]
Single retirees lack a built-in caregiver, making [[health_care_and_longterm_care_planning_for_single_retirees | healthcare costs]] and long-term care expenses a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Typical costs in Canada can range from $25-$50 per hour for home care, $3,000-$5,000 per month for assisted living, $2,000-$3,000 per month for government-subsidized nursing homes, and $5,000+ per month for private nursing home care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

#### Strategies to Mitigate:
*   **Budget for Care**: Allocate funds for potential care needs by maintaining a reserve fund or investigating long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Assign Power of Attorney**: Designate a trusted individual as a power of attorney to make medical and financial decisions if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Disability/Critical Illness Insurance**: Consider these policies to help cover major medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Case Study: Andy Dwire's Retirement Plan

This case study illustrates how diligent [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial planning]] can significantly improve a single retiree's outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Initial Situation:
Andy, a 65-year-old single retiree, aims to retire this year, anticipating annual spending of $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. His assets include $200,000 in an RRSP and $100,000 in a TFSA, with an estimated 5% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He has no pension or spouse and planned to take CPP and OAS at age 65, hoping his money would last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Inflation
Initially, Andy's $50,000 annual spending plan, without accounting for inflation (estimated at 2.1%), would lead his money to run out around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The purchasing power of $50,000 today would decrease to approximately $55,000 at age 70 and $61,000 at age 75, effectively dropping every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Correction 1: Adjusting Spending Estimates
Many people overestimate retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. In reality, spending often drops by about 20% upon retirement and can decline further with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Andy's revised spending estimate was $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s, $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s, and $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This adjustment extended his savings to age 85, improving his goal progress from 54% to 94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Correction 2: Delaying CPP and OAS
Andy initially planned to take CPP and OAS at 65, receiving approximately $10,000 from CPP and $8,700 from OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Delaying these benefits until age 70 significantly increased his income to $17,000 from CPP and $13,000 from OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This change further extended his funds, making his plan fully funded up to age 88 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Correction 3: RRSP Meltdown for Tax Smoothing
Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA, which doesn't count as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. To smooth out taxes, he planned an RRSP meltdown, withdrawing $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This strategy helped cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS, bringing his plan to 102% funded and maintaining a low, smooth effective tax rate (2-3%) until age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This eliminated any shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Building a Buffer: [[Supplemental income strategies for retirees | Additional Income Strategies]]
While 102% funded is good, a larger buffer provides more comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Three options were considered:

1.  **Working One Extra Year**: By working one additional year, earning his current $80,000 salary, Andy's plan could be 114% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Woodworking Hobby**: Andy's passion for woodworking could conservatively generate $10,000 per year for six years, bringing his plan to 112% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb Condo in Summer**: Renting out his condo via Airbnb during summer months (when he stays with family) could also yield $10,000 per year for six years, similarly funding his plan to 112% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Andy preferred options two or three, as he did not wish to work an additional year, emphasizing the importance of starting retirement sustainably and as soon as possible due to declining health with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion
While retirement as a single person in Canada can be challenging, it does not have to be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. With careful planning, including attention to inflation, tax-efficient withdrawal strategies, and considering [[supplemental_income_strategies for retirees | supplemental income]], single retirees can optimize their finances and achieve a confident retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

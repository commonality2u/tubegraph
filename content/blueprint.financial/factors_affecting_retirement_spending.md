Understanding monthly spending in retirement is a common concern for individuals planning their post-work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article breaks down average spending for Canadian retirees, details what they spend their money on, and illustrates how spending changes across different life and retirement stages.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is approximately $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which translates to about $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## [[breakdown_of_expenditure_categories_for_retirees | Breakdown of Expenditure Categories]]

For retirees in Canada, spending is distributed across several key categories:

*   **Shelter:** This is the largest portion of expenditure, covering the cost of main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Retirees spend an average of $13,814 annually on shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, or $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, accounting for 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Even with many retirees owning their homes, significant costs like maintenance, property taxes, and utilities persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses even after mortgage payments cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Food:** Another significant category, retirees spend approximately $7,667 annually on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, averaging $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This makes up 12.4% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> and includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation:** While generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals, transportation still represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** Despite Canada's free healthcare system, healthcare sees a higher allocation in retirement due to increased medical needs as people age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It accounts for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions:** This category takes up 5.4% of monthly spending, highlighting the ongoing need for financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations:** Expenses for maintaining the home contribute 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## [[changes_in_spending_during_different_retirement_phases | How Spending Changes with Age]]

Household spending patterns [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | change significantly]] as individuals progress through different phases of life, from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Data from Stat Canada illustrates this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54):** Spending peaks during this period, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This rise is driven by higher family needs, such as larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, and there's a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64):** Spending begins to decrease slightly, averaging about $99,250 annually or $8,271 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There's also a greater emphasis on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+):** Spending drops further to $61,800 annually or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there is less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## [[changes_in_spending_during_different_retirement_phases | Phases of Spending in Retirement]]

Retirement spending itself typically follows three distinct phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### High Spending Phase (Early Retirement - approx. 65-70)

*   This phase often involves higher spending, exemplified by "Alex" spending about $70,000 annually or $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Housing costs remain high but are reduced if the mortgage is paid off, though maintenance and property taxes continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Transportation costs decrease significantly due to no more daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   Food costs might slightly decrease as dining out becomes less frequent and more meals are prepared at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Individuals often enjoy spending on hobbies and travel, taking advantage of newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Medium Spending Phase (Mid-Retirement - approx. 70-75)

*   Spending typically decreases, with Alex's example showing a drop to around $60,000 annually or $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Transportation costs reduce further as travel becomes even less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   Food costs remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Spending on travel reduces slightly, with a greater focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Low Spending Phase (Later Retirement - 75+)

*   Annual spending drops significantly, exemplified by Alex's spending falling to $50,000 per year or around $4,166 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   Transportation costs are significantly lower as travel becomes rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Travel spending typically ceases, with a primary focus on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

As retirees become less active, they generally tend to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Real-Life Client Insights

Financial professionals observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. On average, retirees spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-end households might spend $5,000 to $9,000 per month or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this can vary significantly; some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This reduction is attributed to several factors:
*   Lower housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Reduced transportation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   Overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these [[changes_in_spending_during_different_retirement_phases | trends]] is crucial for [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

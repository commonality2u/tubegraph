Canada has established international social security agreements with numerous countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These agreements are crucial for immigrants to Canada and Canadians who have lived or plan to retire abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## How They Help with [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]]

These agreements can help individuals qualify for [[Old Age Security OAS benefits abroad | Old Age Security (OAS)]] even if they haven't spent the full required time in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. They allow Canada to count periods of residency or contributions made in certain other countries towards the 10 or 20-year residency minimums required for [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]] eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

For example, if an individual lived in Canada for 7 years and in the UK for 13 years, they might still qualify for [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]] under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Limitations

It is important to note that while these agreements can help meet the 10 or 20-year residency minimums for [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]], they do not count towards the full 40 years required for 100% [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This means recipients will likely receive only a partial [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]] payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Key Countries with Agreements

Canada has agreements with approximately 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, including:
*   United States (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   United Kingdom (UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>
*   Several Asian countries, such as India and the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Many European Union (EU) nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

It is crucial to verify if a specific country has an agreement with Canada before making major retirement decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS portability | GIS]] and International Agreements

The [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS portability | GIS]] (Guaranteed Income Supplement) is *not* protected by international agreements or tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS portability | GIS]] is strictly tied to living in Canada, and it will be cut off if an individual leaves the country for more than six consecutive months, regardless of income levels or continued Canadian tax filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Strategic Considerations for Immigrants

For immigrants planning retirement abroad, understanding these agreements is vital to avoid significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Check Agreements**: Always confirm if a social security agreement exists with the country you plan to retire in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Delaying Departure**: If you are nearing the 20-year [[Old Age Security OAS benefits when living overseas | OAS]] threshold for portability and your desired retirement country does not have an agreement with Canada, it might be beneficial to delay your move for a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Such a delay could potentially lead to hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra benefits over your lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

By proactively checking these agreements and understanding their implications, immigrants can better secure their retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is Canada's newest savings account and is often recommended as the primary account to contribute to before an RRSP in most situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It offers significant advantages in flexibility, home savings, and tax benefits, making it an ideal starting point for many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## [[understanding_fhsa_for_firsttime_home_buyers | Understanding FHSA for First-Time Home Buyers]]

The FHSA allows individuals to contribute up to $8,000 per year, with a lifetime maximum of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. When funds are used to purchase a first home, the full amount can be withdrawn tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A key advantage is that no repayment is required, which provides greater financial freedom and reduces stress, especially in the early years of homeownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

For example, if Paul contributed the maximum of $40,000 to his FHSA over 5 years and then purchased a home, he could withdraw the entire sum tax-free with no obligation to repay it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This contrasts with the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), where up to $60,000 can be withdrawn tax-free, but it must be repaid over 15 years starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Missing an HBP repayment can result in the missed amount being added to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The FHSA's tax-free withdrawals and lack of repayment obligations make it the superior choice for saving for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## [[fhsa_contributions_and_growth_potential | FHSA Contributions and Growth Potential]]

The FHSA offers significant potential for a larger down payment compared to the RRSP HBP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While the RRSP HBP caps tax-free withdrawals at $60,000 and requires repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, the FHSA allows the entire account balance, including investment growth, to be withdrawn tax-free for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

For instance, if Paul contributed $8,000 annually to his FHSA for 5 years ($40,000 total) and achieved a 6% annual return, his account could grow to approximately $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. If he left the money invested for an additional 10 years, it could grow to around $80,000, providing a much larger tax-free down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This flexibility and potential for growth make the FHSA ideal, especially for those not ready to buy a home immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | Tax Advantages of FHSA Versus RRSP]]

The FHSA offers a significant tax advantage. Contributions are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an upfront tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The most notable benefit comes at withdrawal: when funds are used for a first home, the withdrawal is completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This creates a [[tax_advantages_of_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | double tax advantage]], allowing individuals to save on taxes both when contributing and when withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

In contrast, while RRSP contributions are tax-deductible, and HBP withdrawals are tax-free, the HBP requires repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If a repayment is missed, the amount is added to taxable income for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The FHSA's structure, with upfront tax savings, tax-free withdrawals, and no repayment, makes it a simpler and more efficient option for home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | Investment Potential of FHSA and RRSP]]

Both the FHSA and RRSP offer excellent investment opportunities, allowing investments in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. A key benefit of both accounts is tax-deferred growth, meaning taxes are not paid on investment gains as they grow, allowing for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Despite its name, the FHSA functions like an investment account, allowing for strategic investments with significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Since both accounts offer the same investment potential and tax-deferred growth, they are tied in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. The main difference lies in how funds are withdrawn, not how they are invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## FHSA Flexibility for Retirement Savings

While the RRSP is traditionally seen as the primary retirement savings vehicle due to higher contribution limits and its "retirement" focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, the FHSA offers a flexible and powerful alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Even if there are no immediate plans to buy a home, one can contribute up to $40,000 to the FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

A key aspect of [[first_home_savings_account_fhsa_benefits | FHSA Benefits]] is its flexibility: if a home isn't purchased within 15 years, the FHSA balance can be transferred into an RRSP without losing any tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This means the FHSA can act as a bridge to the RRSP, providing the same growth potential with added flexibility for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This transferability allows individuals to take advantage of tax-free withdrawals for a house, or simply transfer the funds to an RRSP without penalties if plans change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## [[situations_favoring_rrsp_over_fhsa | Situations Favoring RRSP Over FHSA]]

Despite the FHSA's broad advantages, there are two key [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings | situations favoring RRSP over FHSA]]:

### Investing in US Stocks
When investing in US stocks, dividends earned in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. However, thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, this tax is avoided if US stocks are held within an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> To bypass the 15% withholding tax on US stock dividends, invest in them through your RRSP, not your FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Employer Matching
If an employer offers to match RRSP contributions, it is essentially free money that significantly boosts retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. For example, if an employer matches $5,000 of an employee's RRSP contribution, the employee's account gains $10,000 that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The FHSA currently does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Therefore, if this benefit is available, the RRSP is the clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

For long-term investors and those with strong work benefits, the RRSP takes the lead in avoiding US dividend taxes and leveraging employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Overall, the FHSA wins in most categories compared to the RRSP, offering greater flexibility, tax advantages, and benefits for saving for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Prioritizing an RRSP only makes more sense when heavily investing in US dividend stocks or receiving employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

For many, understanding what monthly spending will look like is a common concern when planning for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article breaks down [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average spending for Canadian retirees]], what they spend their money on, and how spending changes through the different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Average Household Expenditure for Canadian Retirees

The [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average household expenditure]] for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This averages out to approximately $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Key Spending Categories

The largest portions of expenditures for Canadian retirees are allocated to the following categories:

*   **Shelter** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>: This includes the cost of their main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Retirees spend, on average, $13,814 annually on shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, which breaks down to $1,151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This accounts for about 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Even when retirees own their homes, significant costs like maintenance, property taxes, and utilities are still incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, underscoring the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Food** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>: Retirees spend approximately $7,667 annually on food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, averaging $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, or 12.4% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>: While generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, transportation still represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Healthcare** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>: Despite free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation in retirement due to increased medical needs as people age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>: These take up a significant portion at 5.4% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, highlighting the need for continued financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Household Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>: Expenses for maintaining the home add up to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Spending Changes with Age

Household spending patterns evolve significantly across different life phases, from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>: Spending peaks during this period, averaging $92,646 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, or $7,721 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This rise is driven by larger family needs, increased food consumption, education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, and a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>: Spending decreases slightly to about $99,250 annually on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, or $8,270 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. During this period, childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There is also a greater focus on paying off mortgages and preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>: Spending drops further to $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, and there is less spending on luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending typically occurs in three distinct phases:

1.  **High Spending Phase (Early Retirement - approx. 65-70 years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>:
    *   Annual spending averages around $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, or $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain high, though reduced if the mortgage is paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease significantly with no daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance is still required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Spending on food slightly decreases as dining out becomes less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   High spending on hobbies and travel is common, utilizing newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

2.  **Medium Spending Phase (Mid-Retirement - approx. 70-75 years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>:
    *   Annual spending decreases to around $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, or $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs reduce further as travel becomes less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Food costs remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Spending on travel reduces, with a greater focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

3.  **Low Spending Phase (Later Retirement - after 75 years)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:
    *   Annual spending drops to $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, or around $4,166 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs are significantly lower due to minimal travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   Travel spending typically ceases, with a focus on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Real-Life Client Observations

Financial planners often observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. On average, retirees tend to spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-income households may spend more, typically $5,000 to $9,000 per month or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

However, significant variation exists, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in early retirement might decrease to $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This reduction can be attributed to factors such as lowering housing costs, decreased transportation needs, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, their spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends is crucial for [[common_retirement_planning_strategies in Canada | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] by anticipating changes in spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

The [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] is a vital source of income in retirement, but overlooking its tax implications can lead to significant financial costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. CPP payments are considered taxable income, which can substantially affect an individual's overall tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## How CPP Impacts Your Tax Situation

### Higher Tax Brackets
Receiving CPP payments can increase your total annual income, potentially pushing you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **David's Example**: David, aged 67, retired with an annual income of $90,000 from various sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. When he began receiving an additional $10,000 annually from his CPP benefits, his total income reached $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This increase moved him into a higher tax bracket based on his province of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS) Clawback
Beyond income tax, increased income from CPP can also trigger an Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   **Threshold and Reduction**: If your total income, including CPP, exceeds a specific threshold (e.g., $90,997 for 2024), a portion of your OAS payments will be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For every $100 over the threshold, $15 of OAS benefits are lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This means the more you earn, the more OAS benefits you stand to lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Strategic Planning to Mitigate Tax Impact

Failing to consider the tax implications of CPP can lead to a lower-than-expected retirement income and reduce the effectiveness of your overall retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   **Delayed CPP**: Planning strategically, like David, might involve delaying CPP receipt until age 70 to avoid the OAS clawback for a longer period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Income Source Adjustment**: Adjusting other income sources can also help minimize the tax impact and potentially avoid the OAS clawback entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   [[cpp_income_splitting | Pension Sharing]]: Spouses or common-law partners can choose to split their CPP income, which can lead to significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. For example, if one spouse receives $1,200 per month and the other receives very little, they could split it to report $600 each, making their overall retirement income more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

While [[relying_too_heavily_on_cpp_for_retirement_income | CPP replaces about one-third of an average worker's pre-retirement earnings]], it is a taxable expense that needs to be factored into a comprehensive retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

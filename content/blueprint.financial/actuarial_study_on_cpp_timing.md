Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices Canadians can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin receiving CPP at or before age 65, for many, waiting until age 70 can prove optimal, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This decision is complex, like a jigsaw puzzle, where factors such as [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]], investment returns, and income streams must fit together to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## CPP Basics

Most Canadians claim CPP at age 60, with over 70% starting their benefits at precisely age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. However, individuals have options to start their benefits at any age between 60 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting Early (Age 60)**: Choosing to start CPP at 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **Delaying (Age 70)**: Waiting until 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For example, if Sarah qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, she would receive $640 per month at 60 (a steep reduction), but her payments would jump to $1,420 per month at 70, offering significantly more income later in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from a 2020 Actuarial Study on CPP Timing

A detailed 2020 actuarial study explored the optimal timing for starting CPP, considering probabilities, [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancies]], and expected investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The study provided a "cheat sheet" to guide the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### 1. Starting CPP at 60

This option is generally best for those who need immediate income or have health concerns that suggest a shorter [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Drawbacks**: It comes with permanent drawbacks, including a 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65, which significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those who live beyond around age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Investment Opportunity**: If investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking CPP at 60 allows for investing the payments and potentially coming out ahead, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations**: Starting at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on benefits like the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS), smoothing income across retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Example**: John, a 60-year-old with health issues and very little savings, chose to take CPP early to secure income and avoid GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### 2. Starting CPP at 65

This default option balances steady payments and avoids the need for personal savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's ideal for retirees with below-average to average [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

*   **Predictable Income**: It offers reliable, inflation-adjusted income without requiring additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Tradeoffs**: This choice leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis**: Payments equalize with the 70-option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those unsure of their longevity or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Example**: Maria, age 65, with modest Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) savings and average health, decided to take CPP at 65 to maintain predictable income without depleting her savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### 3. Delaying CPP to 70

[[benefits_of_delaying_cpp | Delaying CPP]] provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, increasing payments by the maximum amount and offering inflation protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for those with longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **Longevity Protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to around 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age**: For most, [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Example**: Susan, age 70, expects to live well into her late 80s or 90s. With sufficient RSP funds, she decided to [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delay CPP]] to maximize her lifetime inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Estimating Life Expectancy for CPP Planning

Your predicted investment returns and [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] are the two key [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision | factors affecting CPP timing decision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The 2020 CPP take-up decision report highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:

*   **Gender Differences**: Women tend to live longer than men, with 82% of women likely to live past age 80, making [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] especially beneficial for secure inflation-protected income in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. For men, the probability is 79% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Longevity Expectations**: A healthy lifestyle or family history of long life increases the odds of living past 80 to 85% for women and 79% for men, making [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delayed CPP]] a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Delaying Often Pays Off**: Even with low longevity expectations, most Canadians are expected to live past 80, suggesting most retirees would benefit from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

According to more recent data from Stats Canada, [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] becomes longer the older an individual gets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82 on average, while a 50-year-old woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Key Takeaways on Life Expectancy:

*   [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | Life expectancy]] in Canada is generally longer than most people realize, often higher than the conventional wisdom of 80 or 82, especially for those who have reached middle age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Women typically benefit more from [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] due to their longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancies]], often reaching their late 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | Delaying CPP]] to age 70 can provide a higher inflation-protected income for their longer retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Men with shorter [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancies]] should carefully balance their longevity with their financial needs when considering [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | Delaying CPP]] acts as a form of longevity insurance, especially crucial for women who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Strategic planning, such as integrating CPP timing with RSP withdrawals, is crucial for optimizing retirement income. Women might prioritize strategies to extend income into their late 80s or 90s, while men focus on steady income for shorter time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Estimating Your Life Expectancy

Several online [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits | life expectancy calculators]] can provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Two popular examples include:

*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity, taking about 5 minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, this tool dives deeper into health and habits, taking 10 to 20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

While these calculators offer personalized outlooks, their results can differ, so they should be taken with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For more refined [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits | life expectancy estimations]], consider:

*   **Genetic Testing**: Uncovers potential health predispositions and longevity factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations**: Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing**: Advanced tests that measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings**: Regular checkups for chronic conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, which significantly impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Using a CPP Present Value Calculator

While CPP break-even tables are a good starting point, they fall short by not considering the investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Instead, a CPP present value calculator, like the one available on TaxTips.ca, provides a more accurate estimate by incorporating these additional [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision | factors affecting CPP timing decision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

The calculator allows users to input:
*   Estimated monthly benefit at age 65 (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Estimated annual indexation of CPP (inflation rate, e.g., 2.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   Desired CPP start ages to evaluate (e.g., 60, 65, 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Estimated [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] (e.g., 86 for an average woman in her 50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   Estimated rate of return on investments (e.g., 2-6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

**Interpreting Results:**
The calculator shows the present value of choosing CPP at different ages. For example, with an estimated [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] of 86 and a 2% rate of return, starting CPP at 70 could yield a present value of approximately $320,000, significantly higher than starting at 60 ($222,000) or 65 ($286,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

**Impact of Variables:**
*   **Rate of Return**: A higher rate of return (e.g., 4% or 6%) can significantly even out the present values between starting ages, making earlier options more competitive compared to the 70-option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | Life Expectancy]]**: Living longer (e.g., to 100) vastly favors [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] to 70, leading to a much higher present value (e.g., over $130,000 more than starting at 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Conversely, a shorter [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] (e.g., passing away at 72) clearly favors taking CPP earlier, like at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Inflation Rate**: High inflation rates (e.g., 4%) tend to make [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] to 70 more advantageous, while lower inflation (e.g., 1%) makes the options closer in present value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Comprehensive CPP Planning

Deciding when to start CPP is a complex puzzle that, if not pieced together carefully, can lead to missing out on significant retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. A comprehensive approach to CPP planning considers various additional [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision | factors affecting CPP timing decision]]:

*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points**: Analyzing how long an individual is likely to live and when [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] starts to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies**: Understanding how CPP income interacts with overall tax situations, potentially reducing or increasing tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining if [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] can help avoid OAS clawbacks or if starting earlier is a better option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination**: Integrating CPP with Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals, Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Often, [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] into the late 60s or 70s proves beneficial for clients, though exceptions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Running different scenarios is crucial to unlock the full potential of CPP with strategies customized to individual [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]], taxes, and retirement goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

Even high-income earners who delay their [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] collection may not receive the maximum benefit if they have gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This is because [[contributions_and_earnings_impact_on_cpp | CPP]] payouts are based on your lifetime contributions, not solely on your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. To receive the maximum [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | CPP]] payout, you generally need at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Common Reasons for Contribution Gaps

Many Canadians fall short of the required contribution years due to various reasons throughout their working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:

*   **Career Breaks**
    Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care can result in years with no [[contributions_and_earnings_impact_on_cpp | CPP]] contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While the child rearing provision can help in some cases, many still experience gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership**
    If you were self-employed and paid lower [[contributions_and_earnings_impact_on_cpp | CPP]] contributions, or did not contribute consistently, it can reduce your lifetime average, even with high earnings in other periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment**
    Years of unemployment, even if followed by a very high salary, can significantly drag down your overall contribution average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry**
    Retiring before age 65 or starting work later in life can prevent you from accumulating the full 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## How Contribution Gaps Affect Your CPP Payout

[[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] calculates your retirement benefit based on your best 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To account for periods of lower or no income, [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] includes a "General Dropout provision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This provision allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest-earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

Considering a potential contribution period of 47 years (from ages 18 to 65), you can effectively drop about 8 years of low or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you delay [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] until age 70, your total potential working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains roughly 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

This provision helps reduce the impact of short gaps in your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. However, if you miss more than 8 years of contributions, your final payout will be lower, even if you earned a high salary and delayed [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] collection until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

For example, a high-income earner named Jerry, who delayed [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] until 70, received less than the maximum benefit because he had several contribution gaps due to reasons like starting a business, going back to school, or unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Even though he maxed out his salary in his working years, these missing years pulled down his average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Think of [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] as a three-legged stool: your payout depends on your salary, timing of collection, and consistency of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. If one leg is weak, the whole structure becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize Contributions and Avoid Gaps

To help get as close to the maximum [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | CPP]] benefit as possible, in addition to delaying collection and earning a high salary, it's crucial to maximize your contribution years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>:

*   **Work for at Least 39 Years**
    Aim to work for at least 39 years with strong contributions to avoid your average being lowered by too many missing years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Utilize Dropout Provisions**
    Be aware that [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] allows you to drop up to 8 years of low or no contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Provision**
    If you took time off to raise children under seven, you may be able to use the child rearing provision to exclude those low-income years from your calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Ensure Contributions When Self-Employed**
    If you're self-employed, make sure you consistently pay into [[contributions_and_earnings_impact_on_cpp | CPP]] to build your contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

Maximizing your [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP]] isn't just about earning more; it's also about making smart decisions regarding the consistency and duration of your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

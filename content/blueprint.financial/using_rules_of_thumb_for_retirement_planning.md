Using rules of thumb can be a valuable starting point for anyone looking to begin their [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. These methods offer a simple way to estimate the financial targets needed for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Common Rules of Thumb

### Age-Based Savings Target
This rule suggests specific savings milestones to reach by certain ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>:
*   By age 30: Aim to have one year of your current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   By age 40: Aim to have three times your salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   By age 50: Aim to have six times your salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   By retirement age: Aim to have between 8 to 10 times your salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

**Example**: If you earn $60,000 annually, you should aim to have $60,000 saved by age 30, $180,000 by age 40, and $480,000 by age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

### The 4% Rule
This rule posits that you can safely withdraw 4% of your [[retirement_savings_growth_strategies | retirement savings]] each year without depleting your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This provides a buffer in case investments do not perform as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

**Example**: If you have $1 million saved, you could withdraw $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

### Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income
A common guideline is to aim for 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. However, a target of 80% to 90% is often preferred to account for potential unexpected [[calculating_retirement_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

**Example**: If your pre-retirement income is $100,000 annually, you might plan for an annual retirement income of $80,000 to $90,000 to cover your [[calculating_retirement_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Household Expenditure Statistics
Statistics Canada's 2021 data indicates that the average expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was approximately $61,800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. In contrast, households aged 40 to 54 spent significantly more, around $120,600 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. This suggests that average [[calculating_retirement_expenses | expenses]] tend to drop considerably by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Based on observation, retirees typically spend between $3,000 to $7,000 per month for singles and $5,000 to $9,000 per month for couples, depending on their desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

## Pros of Using Rules of Thumb
Rules of thumb offer several advantages for initial [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>:
*   **Simplicity**: They are straightforward and easy to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Quick Estimates**: They provide quick estimates of necessary [[retirement_savings_growth_strategies | savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Guideline**: They offer a rough guideline to start your [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

## Cons of Using Rules of Thumb
Despite their simplicity, rules of thumb have notable limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>:
*   **Oversimplification**: They do not account for personal circumstances, inflation, or unexpected [[calculating_retirement_expenses | expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   **Risk of Running Out of Money**: Relying solely on these rules can lead to financial shortfalls if [[calculating_retirement_expenses | expenses]] exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Flexibility**: They do not adapt well to changes in lifestyle or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Solely relying on rules of thumb can lead to running out of money, especially if your [[calculating_retirement_expenses | expenses]] are higher than expected or your investments don't perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

While rules of thumb can be a helpful starting point, they provide a generalized approach to [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | retirement planning]] and may not fully capture the complexities of an individual's financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. For a more precise and robust [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | financial security]] plan, more detailed [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | comprehensive financial planning]] is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

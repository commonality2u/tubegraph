The Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) provides a significant tax relief for individuals selling qualified small business corporation shares in Canada. The year 2025 brings notable updates to this exemption, offering increased opportunities for tax minimization for business owners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>

## What is the Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption?

The LCGE allows individuals to shield a portion of their [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | capital gains]] from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>

## 2025 Updates

For 2025, the LCGE limit has seen a substantial increase, rising to **$1.25 million** from approximately $1 million in 2024. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>

### Example

If a qualified small business is sold for $1.25 million in 2025, the entire capital gain could potentially be exempt from the individual's tax, depending on their remaining LCGE limit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

## Strategic Planning with LCGE

*   **Individual Shareholder Availability**: The LCGE is available to *each* individual shareholder. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> This means that if multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their respective portion of the gains. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> This strategy can significantly reduce the overall tax burden. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

*   **Comparison to Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)**: While the Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI) offers tax relief by reducing the capital gains inclusion rate on eligible gains, the [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption]] (LCGE) often remains a more effective tool for many business owners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> This is because the LCGE provides a complete exemption for eligible capital gains, especially when multiple shareholders are involved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>

    *   By strategically allocating gains across shareholders, the benefits of the LCGE can be maximized, reducing tax liabilities without sole reliance on the CEI. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> This is a nuanced area of tax planning, and combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be powerful if implemented correctly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

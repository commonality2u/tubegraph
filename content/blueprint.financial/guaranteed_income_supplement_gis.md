The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a government benefit designed to help very low-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It is a crucial component for those relying heavily on government pensions for their retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Eligibility and Income Impact

If a senior's total income is very low, they may qualify for the [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), the [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] pension does not count toward [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]] income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

However, if a senior has any additional income, their [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]] is reduced dollar for dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Even small withdrawals from Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) can impact eligibility for [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Payment Amounts

For 2024, the maximum [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]] amount a single senior with no other income can receive is $900 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Combined Income with Other Benefits

For those with no other income source, their total estimated retirement income, including CPP, [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], and [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]], might be around $2,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For example, monthly income could be approximately $800 from CPP, $700 from [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], and $500 from [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

However, relying solely on CPP, [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], and [[Guaranteed Income Supplement GIS | GIS]] for retirement income, even at $2,000 per month, is considered barely above the poverty line and not a comfortable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

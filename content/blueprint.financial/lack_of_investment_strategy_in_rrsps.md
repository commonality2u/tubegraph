Many Canadians regret contributing to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) without a solid investment plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. With numerous investment choices available, some individuals may freeze and do nothing, while others take on excessive risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Both approaches can negatively impact long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Too Many Investment Choices Lead to Paralysis

RRSPs offer a wide array of investment options, including stocks, bonds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), mutual funds, Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs), and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This overwhelming number of choices can lead to decision paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
Some contributors leave their RRSP funds sitting in cash or low-interest savings accounts, thereby missing out on years of potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Others may blindly follow recommendations for high-fee mutual funds from banks, unaware of how much these fees can erode their long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Many express [[costly_misconceptions_about_rrsps | regret]] for not having a clear strategy from the outset and wishing they had taken the time to learn about investment options before contributing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Taking on Too Much Risk Causes Stress

Some RRSP holders go "all in" on high-risk stocks, hoping for significant gains without fully understanding market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. When the market drops, panic can set in, leading to rushed decisions and selling at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Many investors [[costly_misconceptions_about_rrsps | regret]] not diversifying their portfolio, realizing too late that risk without a coherent strategy is akin to gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Playing It Too Safe Hurts Growth

Conversely, some investors are too conservative, keeping their RRSPs in low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or money market funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. While this approach avoids volatility, it also means their money barely keeps pace with inflation, which can significantly limit their retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Many realize years later that their savings did not grow sufficiently, wishing they had adopted a more balanced approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Avoiding RRSP Investment Regrets

To avoid these common RRSP investment regrets:
*   Start with a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Do not contribute solely for the tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Choose investments that align with your risk tolerance, balancing growth (such as stocks) with stability (such as bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   Opt for low-cost ETFs or index funds instead of high-fee mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   Avoid leaving cash sitting idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

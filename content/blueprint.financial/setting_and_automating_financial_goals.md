Establishing clear financial goals and automating your savings and investments are crucial steps for achieving financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This approach provides purpose and direction to your financial plan, acting as a blueprint to prioritize actions and stay on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Automation ensures consistent progress by removing the need for constant decision-making, thereby reducing procrastination and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Knowing your standing empowers you to refocus and make informed decisions for the year ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Steps to Set and Automate Financial Goals

### 1. Define Your Goals
Make your goals specific and measurable for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Examples include:
*   Paying off $6,000 in credit card debt by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Saving $5,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   Building a $15,000 emergency fund (equivalent to 6 months of expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Contributing the full $7,000 TFSA limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Contributing a portion to your RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### 2. Break Goals into Milestones
Divide larger goals into smaller, manageable milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. For example, instead of saving $12,000 for a vacation, target $1,000 per month or $250 per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. For $6,000 in debt repayment, aim for $500 monthly or $125 weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Celebrating these wins helps maintain motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### 3. Automate Contributions
[[Automation in RSP savings and investment | Automating contributions]] for your savings, investments, and debt repayment is a key step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Savings:** Set automatic transfers to a high-interest savings account or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Investments:** Use pre-authorized contributions for RSPs, FHSAs, or other investment accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Debt Repayment:** Schedule regular payments to reduce balances and avoid late fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

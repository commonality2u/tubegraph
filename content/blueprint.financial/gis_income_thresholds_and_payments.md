The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) offers financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Updates for 2025 include unified payment schedules, cost of living adjustments, and revised income thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Payment Dates for 2025

The Government of Canada has set a unified payment schedule for CPP, OAS, and GIS in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means recipients will receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The payment dates are typically in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received a little earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> For added convenience, set up a direct deposit through your My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This ensures timely and reliable payment compared to waiting for a mailed cheque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Cost of Living Adjustments

GIS payments are adjusted quarterly to match changes in the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. However, for the January to March 2025 period, the maximum monthly GIS payment for a single senior remains at $1,086 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This is because there was no Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase over the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Despite the recent stagnation, GIS benefits have grown by 2% over the past year, from January 2024 to January 2025, helping seniors keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Income Thresholds for GIS Qualification

Whether an individual qualifies for GIS depends on their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For the first quarter of 2025, the annual income limit for a single person is $22,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Optimizing your savings accounts can prevent costly mistakes and unlock government grants and employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "free money" opportunities provided by Registered Disability Savings Plans (RDSP), Registered Education Savings Plans (RESP), and employer-matched [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RSP]] contributions are crucial to prioritize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP)

The [[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RDSP]] offers significant support for Canadians with disabilities, providing substantial government grants and bonds for long-term disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

*   **Canada Disability Savings Grant (CDSG)**: This grant matches contributions by 300% on the first $500 and 200% on the next $1,000, allowing for up to $3,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Canada Disability Savings Bond (CDSB)**: This bond provides up to $1,000 annually without requiring any contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

For example, a contribution of $1,500 to an [[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RDSP]] could yield $3,500 from the CDSG and $1,000 from the CDSB, totaling $4,500 in government support each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This makes the [[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RDSP]] a powerful tool for families building financial security for loved ones with disabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)

[[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RESPs]] help families save for post-secondary education with significant government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

*   **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)**: The CESG matches 20% of contributions, up to $500 per year per child, with a lifetime maximum of $7,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Contributing $2,500 annually, for instance, earns a $500 grant, effectively an easy 20% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Canada Learning Bond (CLB)**: Lower-income families can benefit from the CLB, which adds up to $2,000 without requiring contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Starting early with [[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RESPs]] maximizes growth through compounding and can act as a form of income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## RRSP Employer Matching

If your employer offers [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RSP]] matching, it is considered "free money" and should not be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. For example, if an employer matches 50% of contributions up to $1,500, a $3,000 contribution instantly yields an additional $1,500, representing an immediate 50% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Employer matching not only accelerates retirement savings but also instills discipline in savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Always maximize [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RSP]] matching if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Account Prioritization

When considering where to invest your savings, the following priority order is recommended to maximize benefits and minimize taxes, especially given the "free money" advantage of these accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:

1.  **[[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RDSP]]**: Prioritize if you qualify due to the highly generous government grants for disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
2.  **[[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RSP]] with Employer Matching**: Take advantage of free employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
3.  **[[registered_education_savings_plans_and_registered_disability_savings_plans | RESP]]**: Offers a 20% government match up to $500 per year for education savings, plus it aids in income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

These accounts should be prioritized even before TFSAs or FHSAs due to the direct "free money" benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The right account choices depend on individual financial goals, income, and savings needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

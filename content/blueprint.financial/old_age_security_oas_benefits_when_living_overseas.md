The [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefit is a Canadian government pension based on residency, not work history or contributions, unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:10">[04:45:10]</a>. Understanding how OAS behaves when you move abroad is crucial for [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Canadian retirees moving abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## How OAS Benefits are Affected by Moving Abroad

### Residency Requirements for OAS Abroad
To receive OAS while living outside of Canada, specific residency rules must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. The key rule is that you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. If this threshold is met, your monthly OAS payment will continue even if you are living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

> [!Example] Pedro's Case
> Pedro moved to Canada at age 25 and lived there for 30 years before retiring to Spain. Because he met the 20-year residency requirement, he continues to receive his full OAS payments while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

### When OAS May Stop
If you do not meet the 20-year residency rule, your OAS benefits could stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. This occurs if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. In such cases, you would need to return to Canada and re-establish residency to restart receiving payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.

### Exceptions: Social Security Agreements
There are exceptions to the 20-year rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>. You might still qualify for [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_abroad | OAS benefits abroad]] if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. If the combined time you lived in both countries is at least 20 years, you may qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. It's important to note that years lived in another country do not increase your OAS amount; they only help determine if you qualify to keep receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

## [[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | Tax Implications for Canadian Retirees Abroad]]

Your OAS payments are considered taxable income, even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### Withholding Tax
If you live outside of Canada, your OAS may be subject to a non-resident withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The default rate is 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. However, if you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, that rate may be reduced or eliminated entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

*   **Example: United States** - If you move to the US, Canada's tax treaty means your OAS is not subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Germany** - If you move to Germany, Canada does have a tax treaty in place. Under Article 18 of the Canada-Germany tax treaty, Canada may tax public pensions like OAS at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. You might end up paying about a 15% withholding tax on your OAS payments while living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

You can request voluntary tax deductions by logging into your My Service Canada account or filling out a specific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

### Tax Filing Requirements
While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip each year instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. You must include this slip when you file your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. It is mandatory to continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

### OAS Recovery Tax (Clawback)
The OAS recovery tax, also known as the clawback, begins at a certain income threshold ($93,454 in 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. To manage your taxable income and potentially avoid this clawback, consider strategies such as RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

> [!Tip] OAS Pro Tip

## Planning Strategies and Considerations

### Example: Anita's Retirement in Portugal
Anita, 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years of living and working in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. She qualified for CPP and became eligible for OAS because she crossed the 20-year residency threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Portugal has a social security and tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

*   Her CPP continued without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Thanks to the tax treaty, she pays a reduced 15% withholding tax on her CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
*   Her OAS also continued since she met the 20-year requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. If she had moved a year earlier (before hitting 20 years), she would not have received OAS until returning to Canada or qualifying through a treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   Her Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) stopped after 6 months, as GIS requires ongoing Canadian residency with no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

Anita's successful strategy included:
*   Delaying her move until she hit 20 years of residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   Choosing a treaty country like Portugal to reduce tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   Planning early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### General Guidance
OAS is described as "selective" â€“ it will only follow you abroad if you've built a strong enough relationship with Canada, meaning 20 plus years of living in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. If not, it might stay home unless you have "mutual friends" in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

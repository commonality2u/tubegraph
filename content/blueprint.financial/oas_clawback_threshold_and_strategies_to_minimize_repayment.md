The Old Age Security (OAS) pension recovery tax, commonly known as the "clawback," requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their OAS benefits if their net income exceeds a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## OAS Clawback Threshold Update

For the period from July 2024 to June 2025, the OAS clawback threshold is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Seniors whose net income surpasses this amount are required to repay 15% of the excess income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Example Calculation
> If a senior's net income is $100,000, the repayment amount would be 15% of the difference between $100,000 and the $90,997 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This calculation results in a repayment of approximately $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

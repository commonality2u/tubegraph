Retirees can utilize various tax credits and strategies to reduce their tax bills and retain more of their income for travel, hobbies, and loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Basic Tax Credits for Retirees

Several fundamental [[key_canadian_tax_credits_and_benefits | tax credits]] can significantly reduce a retiree's tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For instance, Marjorie, a 67-year-old earning $40,000 annually from her pensions in Ontario, is in a combined 20% federal and provincial tax bracket, and these credits make a meaningful difference for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

*   **Benefit** Every Canadian can earn $15,000 tax-free thanks to the basic personal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **Application** This credit is automatically applied when filing taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Example (Marjorie)** The first $15,000 of Marjorie's income is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, saving her $3,000 at a 20% tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Age Amount Credit

*   **Eligibility** Once you turn 65, you are eligible for the age amount credit, which offers extra tax relief for seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Benefit** This credit provides an additional $8,790 tax exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Phase-out** The age amount credit begins to phase out for higher income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In 2024, if a retiree's income exceeds $42,335, the credit starts to reduce, phasing out entirely at around $113,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Application** Like the basic personal amount, this is also applied automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Example (Marjorie)** Since Marjorie's income is $40,000, she qualifies for the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, saving her an additional $1,758 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Pension Income Amount Credit

*   **Benefit** This credit allows a retiree to claim up to $2,000 of eligible pension income tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Eligible Income** Includes income from a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) or employer pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Ineligible Income** This credit does not apply to CPP or Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Application** It can be claimed by reporting eligible pension income on line 31400 of the tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Example (Marjorie)** This credit adds $400 in tax savings for Marjorie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

In total, these three credits provide Marjorie with $5,158 in tax savings annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Additional Strategies for Tax Savings in Retirement

Beyond direct tax credits, several other [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | strategies]] can help retirees manage their taxable income and maximize their savings.

### Timing CPP and OAS Benefits

Deciding when to start your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and OAS benefits can significantly impact your [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | retirement income]] and tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

*   **Delaying Benefits** Delaying CPP and OAS until age 70 increases monthly payments significantly: CPP grows by 8.4% per year after age 65, and OAS by 7.2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This higher income is often worth the wait, especially if other income sources cover early expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Delaying can also help avoid a higher marginal tax bracket and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Starting Early** Delaying isn't always best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Consider starting CPP or OAS sooner if you have health concerns (shorter life expectancy) or immediate income needs where other sources are limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Income Splitting Strategies

Income splitting can significantly reduce the overall tax burden, especially when one spouse or common-law partner is in a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

*   **CPP/QPP Pension Sharing** Higher-income retirees can allocate part of their CPP benefits to a lower-income spouse, reducing the household's total tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Both spouses must be at least 60, live together, and have contributed to CPP or QPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting** Retirees aged 65 and older can allocate up to 50% of eligible pension income (e.g., RRIF payments, annuities) to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This can be adjusted annually and helps lower the overall tax burden and prevent potential OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions** High-income earners can contribute to a spousal RRSP, allowing income to be shifted to the lower-income spouse upon [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This equalizes withdrawals and reduces overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Be aware of the attribution rule: contributions made within two years of withdrawals will be taxed back to the contributing spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Mastering TFSA and RRSP for Taxable Income Control

Strategically using Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) and Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) can help control taxable income, reduce taxes, and keep benefits intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Using TFSA Withdrawals to Supplement RRSP Income** RRSP withdrawals are fully taxable and can push you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Pairing RRSP withdrawals with tax-free TFSA withdrawals can meet income needs without bumping into a higher marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Shifting Excess RRSP Funds to TFSA** If not all RRSP withdrawals are needed for living expenses, transferring excess funds to a TFSA is a smart move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This helps avoid large RRIF minimum withdrawals in the future that could push you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Funds in a TFSA also gain tax-free growth and can be withdrawn at any time without additional tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Preserving Government Benefits** Since TFSA withdrawals don't count as taxable income, they are ideal for covering extra expenses without risking OAS or GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Advanced Strategies: Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) and Family Trusts

For high-net-worth households and business owners, Family Trusts and IPPs offer powerful ways to manage wealth, reduce taxes, and pass assets efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

*   **Family Trusts for Tax Savings** A Family Trust can facilitate income splitting, capital gains exemptions, and bypassing probate fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
    *   Income from trust-held assets can be allocated to family members in lower tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
    *   Business owners can spread capital gains exemptions among family members when a business is sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
    *   An estate freeze within a trust can fix asset values, so future growth benefits beneficiaries without increasing the taxable estate amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   In some provinces, assets held in a trust avoid probate fees, passing more wealth directly to beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
    *   **Considerations:** Be aware of attribution rules (income from transferred assets may be taxed back to the original owner) and the 21-year rule (trust assets are deemed disposed of every 21 years, triggering capital gains tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Trusts also incur setup and administrative costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Individual Pension Plans (IPPs)** IPPs are a flexible retirement savings tool for business owners, allowing for larger contributions than RRSPs and providing substantial tax deductions for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. They also help in estate planning by avoiding the immediate tax burden associated with RRSP inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, and allow family members (such as children) to be added as plan members for tax-efficient wealth transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Combining Family Trusts with IPPs offers high-net-worth families flexible, tax-efficient options for preserving wealth and reducing taxes on future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

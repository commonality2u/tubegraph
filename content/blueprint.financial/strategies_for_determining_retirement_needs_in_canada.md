A common question among clients is how much money is needed for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The answer depends on an individual's unique situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article will outline four common [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | strategies]] to determine a target retirement number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## The Risk of Ruin in Retirement

It's crucial to properly assess retirement needs to avoid a failed retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Consider Vincent, who retired at age 60 with $400,000 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. He planned to withdraw $40,000 annually, expecting his investments to grow and his savings to last 15 years, after which he'd rely on government pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Here's what actually happened:
*   **Year 1:** Started with $400,000, withdrew $40,000, leaving $360,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   **Year 5:** Savings dropped to $200,000 after withdrawals, unexpected minor investment losses, and a $50,000 home repair expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His balance became $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Year 10:** Savings were depleted to $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. His annual expenses were $40,000, but his income from CPP and OAS only covered $25,000, leaving a $15,000 annual shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Running out of money in retirement poses significant challenges, including struggling to cover essential expenses like housing, healthcare, and daily living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. It can lead to loss of [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | financial independence]] and reliance on family or government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

The primary goal for retirement is to avoid the "risk of ruin" â€“ running out of money before the end of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This limits the ability to enjoy life, travel, or handle emergencies, and can make individuals a burden to family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Common Strategies for Retirement Planning

Here are common [[strategies_to_manage_personal_finances_in_canada | strategies]] Canadians use to determine their retirement savings needs:

### 1. The "Do Nothing" Retirement Strategy

Unfortunately, a significant number of Canadians do not plan or prepare for retirement at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Approximately 52% of Canadians feel they are behind on their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Shockingly, 20% of those aged 55 to 64 have no money set aside for retirement, meaning they will likely retire with close to $0 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
This "ostrich head in the sand" method involves ignoring the problem and hoping it resolves itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Ignoring retirement planning can lead to serious consequences, such as having to work beyond your planned retirement age or relying on minimal government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### 2. Using Rules of Thumb for Retirement Planning

Rules of thumb offer a good starting point for retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

*   **Age-Based Savings Target:**
    *   By age 30: Aim for one year of current salary saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   By age 40: Aim for three times your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   By age 50: Aim for six times your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   By retirement age: Aim for 8 to 10 times your salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If you earn $60,000 annually, you should have $60,000 saved by age 30, $180,000 by age 40, and $480,000 by age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   **The 4% Rule:**
    This rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings annually without running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For example, $1 million saved allows a $40,000 annual withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Vincent's 10% withdrawal rate was much higher, contributing to him running out of money when investments underperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The 4% rule provides a buffer for investment fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

*   **Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income:**
    A common rule of thumb is to aim for 70% to 80% of your pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. A starting point of 80% to 90% is often preferred to account for unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For instance, if you earn $100,000 pre-retirement, plan for an annual retirement income of $80,000 to $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

*   **Household Expenditure Stats (Stats Canada 2021):**
    *   Average expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was around $61,800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   For those aged 40 to 54, the average was $120,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   Expenses generally drop significantly by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   Retirees often spend $3,000-$7,000 per month for single people, and $5,000-$9,000 per month for couples, depending on desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

```ad-note
title: Pros and Cons of Rules of Thumb
**Pros:**
*   **Simplicity:** Easy to remember and provide quick estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **Guidance:** Offer a rough guideline to start planning retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

**Cons:**
*   **Oversimplification:** Don't account for personal circumstances, inflation, or unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Risk of Running Out of Money:** Relying solely on these rules can lead to financial shortfalls if expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Lack of Flexibility:** Don't adapt well to changes in lifestyle or [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | financial situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
```

### 3. Using Online Retirement Calculators

Online retirement calculators are accessible tools that provide a quick sense of your retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

*   **Canada.ca Retirement Calculator:** Provided by the government, it's thorough and considers many factors, but is not very user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It can take about 30 minutes and requires detailed financial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Well Simple Retirement Calculator:** Easy to use with a clean interface and quick to fill out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, it might lack the detail of more comprehensive tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Sun Life Retirement Calculator:** Balances ease of use with a fair amount of detail, making it a good middle-ground option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Most online calculators work similarly: you input your age, income, savings, planned retirement age, and expected expenses, and they provide an assessment of your retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

```ad-note
title: Pros and Cons of Online Retirement Calculators
**Pros:**
*   **Accessibility:** Easy to find and use online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Quick Estimates:** Provide a fast snapshot of retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Basic Guidance:** Offer basic advice on achieving retirement goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

**Cons:**
*   **Lack of Detailed Analysis:** Some may not provide the comprehensive analysis needed for a thorough retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **User Experience:** Tools like Canada.ca can be cumbersome and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Assumptions:** Often rely on assumptions that might not perfectly fit your personal situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Limited Scope:** May not consider all factors like [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | tax implications]], healthcare costs, or lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **User Error:** Incorrect inputs due to lack of financial knowledge can lead to false confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
```

### 4. Comprehensive Financial Planning

For the most thorough approach to determining retirement needs, consider hiring a fee-for-service financial planner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Retirement planning is akin to solving a complex math problem with many variables and assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

A typical six-step process for comprehensive financial planning:

1.  **Initial Consultation:** A one-on-one video consultation to understand financial goals, current situation, retirement aspirations, risk tolerance, and specific concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This step is vital for tailoring a plan to unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
2.  **Detailed Data Collection:** Gathering comprehensive financial data, focusing on Canadian specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This includes:
    *   Income and expenses (detailed review of cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   Savings and investments (TFSA, RSP, other accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
    *   Debts and liabilities (mortgage, credit card debt, loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
    *   Government benefits (Canada Pension Plan - CPP, Old Age Security - OAS entitlements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
    *   Employer pensions (company or registered pension plans - RPPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   Expected retirement age and desired retirement lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
    This information creates a comprehensive picture of financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
3.  **Developing a Comprehensive Financial Strategy:** Creating a tailored strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, including:
    *   [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | Tax optimization]]: Optimizing TFSAs and RSPs to minimize taxes and maximize [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This includes withdrawal and contribution strategies, income splitting, and pension income credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   Investment management: Creating a diversified portfolio with Canadian and international assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   Retirement expense planning: Considering different phases of retirement spending, such as higher spending initially for travel, moderate spending in middle years, and lower spending in later years (except for potential healthcare costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   Government benefits integration: Strategic planning for when to take CPP and OAS to maximize benefits, considering early retirement reductions and deferral increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
    *   Estate planning: Ensuring assets are distributed according to wishes, including wills and [[tax_implications_for_retiring_alone_in_canada | tax implications]] of RSP/RIFF withdrawals upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. A detailed retirement plan is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
4.  **Stress Testing:** Modeling different scenarios to account for challenges, such as:
    *   Market volatility: How the plan holds up during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
    *   Longevity: What if you live longer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
    *   Inflation: Impact of rising costs on savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
    *   Unexpected major expenses: Handling large unforeseen costs like home repairs or family financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
5.  **Implementation Assistance:** Helping set up investment accounts, adjusting saving plans, or working with other professionals like tax advisors or estate planners to ensure smooth implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
6.  **Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustments:** Retirement planning is not a one-time event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Regular reviews and adjustments are made based on changes in life or [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | financial situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This aims for a significant return on investment (ROI) for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

```ad-note
title: Pros and Cons of Comprehensive Financial Planning
**Pros:**
*   **Customization:** Plans are tailored to specific needs and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Comprehensiveness:** Covers all aspects of your financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Adaptability:** Adjusts to changes in circumstances and plans for many different scenarios and strategies to increase net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

**Cons:**
*   **Complexity:** Detailed planning can be more complex and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Cost:** Professional planning services come with fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
*   **Not Perfect:** Still based on assumptions and unforeseen negative events (job loss, investment downturns) can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
```

Despite its cons, the detailed approach is generally considered the best way to figure out retirement needs because it provides many different scenarios and stress tests the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. While no plan can perfectly predict the future, this approach greatly reduces uncertainty and provides peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## The Reality of Retirement Income in Canada

There is no single "magic dollar amount" for Canadians to retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The amount needed depends heavily on desired lifestyle and retirement quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

In [[the_reality_of_retiree_income_in_canada | reality of retiree income]], some retirees manage with $500,000 in low-cost areas, while others need at least $800,000 in higher-cost areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Lavish spenders may require several million dollars and can still come close to depleting their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

Therefore, understanding individual needs and planning accordingly, while also factoring in some wiggle room for unexpected events, is crucial for [[strategies_for_managing_retirement_on_limited_income | managing retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

When considering your [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement income planning]], the decision of when to start your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While starting early at age 60 might seem appealing, delaying your CPP could be a significantly better financial decision for your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores several reasons why taking your CPP at age 60 could be a major mistake, focusing on how delaying benefits can enhance your overall [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | retirement income]] and financial stability.

## 1. Higher Payouts by Delaying

The most direct and obvious reason to delay your CPP is that you will receive a substantially higher monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Consider Jennifer's example:
*   If she starts CPP at age 65 (the baseline), she receives $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Starting at age 60 reduces her benefits by 0.6% per month, leading to a total 36% reduction, resulting in only $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Delaying to age 70 increases her benefits by 0.7% per month, totaling a 42% increase, which means $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Delaying CPP to age 70 can more than double your monthly benefit compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This illustrates a key aspect of [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_benefits | strategies to increase CPP benefits]] and [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | maximizing CPP payouts]].

## 2. Sufficient Income or Savings Until Age 70

If you possess a solid [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | retirement savings portfolio]] including RRSPs, TFSAs, and potentially a workplace pension, you might have enough resources to comfortably cover your expenses from age 60 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This allows your investments to continue growing, and you avoid reducing your CPP benefits early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. By age 70, you begin receiving significantly increased CPP payments, boosting your [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This strategic delay can lead to greater financial stability and higher guaranteed income in your 70s and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Of course, if the money is needed at age 60, then taking CPP early is a valid choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## 3. Good Health and Longevity

If you are in excellent health as you approach retirement, delaying CPP might be an optimal choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Life expectancy in Canada is higher than many realize; a 60-year-old Canadian is expected to live to approximately 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Starting CPP at 60 locks in a lower monthly amount for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. If you live longer than average, the reduced income might not be sufficient to cover your needs as you age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

CPP payments last for the rest of your life once started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Calculations suggest that the break-even point where you earn more money by delaying CPP from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If you anticipate living past this age, or well into your 90s, delaying CPP could be an excellent decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## 4. Protection Against Inflation

The [[cpp_and_inflation_considerations | CPP is indexed to inflation]] to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This means your CPP payouts will increase to match periods of high inflation, such as the 4.4% increase in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The longer you delay your CPP, the larger your inflation-indexed payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This unique feature makes CPP a valuable inflation-protected income source for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## 5. Trust in CPP Management

Concerns about the [[cpp_sustainability_and_financial_planning | sustainability of CPP]] are sometimes raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. However, the risk of the CPP running out of money is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Here's why:
*   **Growing Contributions**: CPP contributions are projected to significantly grow, from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 for the base CPP, and from $9.3 billion to $45 billion for the additional CPP over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This ensures a substantial cash flow into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Regular Reviews**: The CPP undergoes regular independent peer reviews to ensure its actuarial methods and assumptions are sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The latest report confirmed that CPP is financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Strong Investment Returns**: The CPP Investment Portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as per its 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

These factors indicate that the CPP is well-funded and at a very low risk of being underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## 6. Avoiding OAS Clawback

Old Age Security (OAS) payments, which can be up to $784 per month, are subject to clawbacks if your income exceeds certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The OAS clawback begins if you earn more than $90,995 (as of the latest figures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If your CPP payments are too high, they might push you into this clawback territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Example: Simon has an annual income of $30,000 from employment pensions, $20,000 from RRSPs, $10,000 from investments, and $21,000 from CPP (starting at age 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. His total income after age 70 is $81,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Even with delayed CPP, his income remains below the $90,995 threshold, avoiding any OAS clawback and allowing him to keep all his benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This highlights a key aspect of [[tax_implications_of_cpp_payments | tax implications of CPP payments]].

## 7. Not Needing Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from sources like RRSPs or work pensions, you likely won't qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. In such cases, delaying your CPP payments to receive larger benefits won't negatively impact your eligibility for GIS, as you wouldn't qualify for it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## 8. RRSP Tax Planning

Delaying CPP can be a strategic move for RRSP tax planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. You might want to draw down your RRSP quicker between ages 60 and 70 to minimize taxes upon your death, leaving more money for your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Simplified example:
*   Between ages 60-70, with $40,000 annual living expenses, you can withdraw $40,000 annually from your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This reduces your RRSP balance but covers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   At age 70, your enhanced CPP of $21,000 kicks in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. You only need an additional $19,000 annually from other sources (remaining RRSP, work pensions, TFSA) to cover your $40,000 expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   This strategy can lead to lower taxes upon death and a larger estate for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This relates to [[cpp_and_capital_loss_splitting_strategies | CPP and capital loss splitting strategies]].

## 9. Still Working in Your 60s

More Canadians are working later into their 60s and even 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. If you continue working well into your 60s:
*   You likely won't need early CPP income, making it easier to delay for additional payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   You will continue making contributions to your CPP from age 60 to 65, even if you start early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   The benefit from delaying CPP is often greater than what could be earned by taking CPP early and investing it, as it's difficult to achieve such high returns in the market consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This underscores the [[importance_of_cpp_contribution_history_and_earnings | importance of CPP contribution history and earnings]].

## 10. More Predictable and Stable Income

Delaying CPP can lead to a more predictable and stable [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | income for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. By drawing down on your investments (RRSP, TFSA, non-registered assets) in your early 60s to cover expenses, you can effectively trade uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Example: If your eligible CPP at 60 is $640/month, but it increases to $1,000/month by delaying until 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. If monthly expenses are $2,000, you can withdraw $2,000 from your RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This strategy secures a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for the rest of your life, providing a stable income stream less reliant on fluctuating market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision of when to take CPP is a personal one, influenced by your unique financial situation and individual factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

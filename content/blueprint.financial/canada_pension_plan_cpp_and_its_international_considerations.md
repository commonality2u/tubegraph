Many Canadians who retire abroad are often unaware of how their government benefits are affected once they leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Specifically, three key benefits — the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) — behave differently when a recipient moves outside of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Understanding these differences is crucial for [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement income planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) for Non-Residents

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is not a portable benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is designed to support low-income seniors who reside in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. There is no social security agreement that will protect your GIS, as it is strictly tied to your physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

If GIS is a vital part of your [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement income]], it is important to consider this before relocating abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Options might include delaying your move, adjusting your budget, or exploring [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | other income options]] to replace the lost benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Some retirees, known as "snowbirds," maintain part-year residency in Canada to keep their healthcare and tax status, ensuring they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Benefits for Non-Residents

The [[effects_on_canada_pension_plan_cpp_for_nonresidents | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] is based on your contributions made during your working life in Canada, rather than your residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means your CPP benefits are portable and will continue to be paid regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The amount received remains the same whether you reside in Canada or in another country like Portugal, Thailand, or Costa Rica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Tax Implications

[[tax_implications_of_cpp_payments | Your CPP payments]] may be subject to withholding tax if you are considered a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaties**: If Canada has a tax treaty with your new country of residence, this tax could be reduced or even eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, a tax treaty is in place that may allow you to avoid withholding tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **No Tax Treaty**: Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It is crucial to review your destination's tax treaty with Canada, as agreements vary widely and can significantly impact your net CPP benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements

Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These agreements help to:
*   Avoid double contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Ensure your CPP coverage continues uninterrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Coordinate benefits if you have worked both in Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Other CPP Benefits and Payment Options

CPP survivor benefits and child benefits also continue for those living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Regarding [[canadian_pension_plan_payment_options | receiving your CPP payments]], you can opt for direct deposit into a Canadian bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. In many countries, payments can be received in local currency through a local bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, or even mailed as a check in Canadian dollars if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While the CPP amount doesn't change, your new country of residence might tax these payments differently, so checking local tax laws is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Benefits for Non-Residents

[[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | Old Age Security (OAS)]] is based on residency, not on your work history or contributions like CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **20-Year Residency Rule**: To qualify for OAS while living outside of Canada, you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. If this threshold is met, your monthly OAS payments will continue even if you live permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Less Than 20 Years Residency**: If you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months after your departure month, your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. You would need to return to Canada and re-establish residency to resume receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Exceptions and Social Security Agreements

You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada, and the combined time you lived in both countries totals at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, the years lived in another country do not increase your OAS amount; they only help determine if you qualify to continue receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Taxation of OAS

Your OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Federal tax is not automatically withheld each month, but you can request voluntary tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident Withholding Tax**: OAS may also be subject to a non-resident withholding tax, with a default rate of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaty Impact**: If you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, that rate may be reduced or eliminated entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, the tax treaty means your OAS is not subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, for countries like Germany, while a tax treaty exists, it does not eliminate withholding tax on OAS; instead, Canada may tax public pensions at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip annually instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, and you must include it when filing your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Continuing to file a Canadian tax return every year is mandatory to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### OAS Recovery Tax (Clawback)

The OAS recovery tax, or "clawback," begins at a specific income threshold (e.g., $93,454 in 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Strategies to manage taxable income and avoid this include RRSP withdrawals, pension income splitting, or deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Planning Strategies

Consider delaying your move abroad until you meet the 20-year residency requirement for OAS eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Choosing a country with a tax treaty with Canada can significantly reduce the tax burden on your CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Early [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | planning]] is essential to manage your budget, especially if you anticipate the loss of GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Summary of Benefits Abroad

Think of your benefits as travel companions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>:
*   **CPP (Canada Pension Plan)**: Your "ride or die" friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. It will follow you wherever you go, but watch out for potential withholding taxes at your destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **OAS (Old Age Security)**: More selective, it will only come if you built a strong enough relationship (20+ years of living in Canada after age 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Otherwise, it might stay home unless there's a social security agreement with your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **GIS (Guaranteed Income Supplement)**: This friend loves Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They are generous while you're in Canada, but will cease payments if you leave for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. There is no treaty or workaround for GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Additional Pro Tips for Retiring Abroad

*   Consider drawing down your RRSPs before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Plan for private healthcare, as provincial coverage ends after six to seven months abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Retiring abroad involves navigating changing financial rules and potential expensive consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides hundreds of tax deductions and credits, yet many Canadians may miss out on eligible tax breaks, leaving money on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article highlights some of the most frequently overlooked tax breaks that could significantly increase your tax refund.

## Commonly Missed Tax Breaks

### Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)
The Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) aims to assist low-income Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An estimated 240,000 eligible individuals do not claim this benefit annually, resulting in $175 million in unclaimed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This oversight often stems from a complicated application process and a lack of awareness regarding eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Paper filing exacerbates the issue, with only half of paper filers claiming the benefit compared to those using tax software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Pension Income Splitting
For retired individuals, [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | pension income splitting]] can lead to significant savings, especially if one spouse is in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This allows you to transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your spouse, effectively lowering the household's total tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Many retirees do not take advantage of this because they are unaware or mistakenly assume it is an automatic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. To claim, you must complete Form T1032 with your tax return each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Moving Expenses Deduction
If you moved at least 40 km closer to a new job or educational institution, you might be able to [[lesser_known_tax_deductions_in_canada | deduct moving expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Eligible expenses include travel, storage, and even temporary accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. A common oversight is failing to track and keep receipts for these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Moving costs can only be deducted against income earned at the new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If you moved but have not yet started work or school, you will need to wait to claim the deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Spousal RRSP Contributions
Many couples overlook contributing to a spousal RRSP as a tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Instead of solely maximizing one individual's RRSP, contributing to a spousal RRSP helps distribute retirement income more evenly, reducing future taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This is particularly beneficial if one spouse has a significantly higher income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. You receive an immediate tax deduction for the contribution, and when the funds are eventually withdrawn, they are taxed at the spouse's potentially lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Home Buyer's Amount
First-time home buyers may be eligible for the Home Buyer's Amount, a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. As of 2022, eligible individuals can claim up to $10,000, translating to a tax reduction of up to $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Despite its benefit, many first-time buyers are unaware of this credit and fail to claim it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Home Office Expense Deduction
The rise of remote work has made the home office expense deduction more relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Both employees and self-employed individuals can claim expenses related to their home workspace, such as rent, utilities, and internet costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. However, many eligible taxpayers overlook this due to lack of awareness or the perceived complexity of the claims process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. In the 2023 tax season, Canadians claimed $2.08 billion in home office expenses, a 41% increase from the previous year, yet many still miss out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Tuition and Education Credits
Students can claim this credit to offset the cost of post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Unused credits can also be transferred to a spouse, parent, or grandparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Many students and families are unaware or unsure how to claim these, missing out on tax relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The credit applies to post-secondary tuition fees, provided the school is on the CRA's designated list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Child Care Expense Deduction
Parents can [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | deduct expenses]] for childcare, such as daycare, nannies, and certain educational programs, up to a specified limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Many parents fail to claim these due to inadequate record-keeping or lack of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This deduction typically must be claimed by the lower-income spouse and only applies to expenses incurred to allow the parent to work, study, or run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Charitable Donations Tax Credit
Donating to registered charities can provide a tax credit of up to 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Unused donations can be carried forward for up to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Many Canadians forget to claim their charitable donations, missing out on potential tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Gather all your donation receipts in one place well before tax time to avoid scrambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Student Loan Interest Credit
Interest paid on government student loans is eligible for a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Many graduates forget to claim it, especially since financial institutions may no longer send automatic interest statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. If not claimed in previous years, it can be carried forward for up to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This credit applies only to government student loans; private loans and lines of credit do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC)
Seniors or individuals with disabilities can claim the HATC for renovations that improve their home's accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. You can claim up to $20,000 in eligible expenses, providing a 15% tax credit, which translates to a maximum benefit of $3,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Despite its benefits, many eligible individuals are unaware of this credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Renters' Tax Credit
Certain provinces offer tax credits to help renters offset housing costs, though they come with specific criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Ontario:** The Ontario Trillium Benefit (OTB) considers rent, income, and age for eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Manitoba:** Renters can claim up to $525 per year through the Education Property Tax Credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Quebec:** Offers a solidarity tax credit that includes a housing component for low-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
If you work from home, you might also be able to [[intermediate_level_tax_writeoffs_including_hiring_family_members_and_equipment_depreciation | deduct]] part of your rent as a home office expense under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Always keep receipts, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Eligible Dependent Amount
If you are single, divorced, or widowed and supporting a dependent, you may qualify for the eligible dependent amount, a non-refundable tax credit that can significantly reduce your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Many Canadians overlook this due to a lack of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. To qualify, the dependent must be a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, or sister who is either under 18 or has a physical or mental impairment, and must have lived with you in a home you maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Tutoring Services Tax Credit
If your child has a learning disability, you may be able to claim tutoring expenses as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. To qualify, a medical practitioner must certify in writing that these services are required due to the child's condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The tutoring must be provided by someone in the business of offering such services and not related to the student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Many parents are unaware of this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Meals and Entertainment Deduction
Self-employed individuals can deduct 50% of eligible meals and entertainment expenses incurred for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. While many business owners are aware, they often fail to meticulously track these expenses, leading to missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Keeping detailed records is crucial for significant tax savings and to support claims in case of an audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Carrying Charges Deduction
Investors can [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | deduct fees]] paid for investment advice and interest on loans used to earn investment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Many overlook these, missing out on potential tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Reviewing financial statements and consulting a tax professional can help identify and claim these eligible expenses, reducing taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, management fees paid to investment partners are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Strategies for Ensuring All Tax Breaks Are Claimed

Filing taxes doesn't have to be costly, and the right tools can help catch missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Utilize Free Tax Software
Programs such as Well Simple Tax and TurboTax Free can flag missing credits and deductions while guiding you through your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Check CRA My Account
You can review past tax returns and amend them for a certain period if you missed a tax credit in previous years, potentially receiving retroactive money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Use Autofill to Avoid Errors
Many tax programs can pull your tax slips, such as T4s and RRSP contributions, directly from the CRA. This reduces mistakes and helps ensure you don't forget anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Set Up Simple Tracking Systems
Most people miss tax deductions not because they don't qualify or are unaware, but because they forget to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The key is to establish simple systems:
*   **Receipt Scanning App:** Apps like Expensify or QuickBooks can automatically track receipts by scanning them with your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Tax Receipts Email Folder:** Create a dedicated email folder for tax-related documents that typically arrive via email, making them easy to find during tax season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Consider creating a separate folder for each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Quick Tax Deductions Checklist:** Before filing, review a simple checklist of common deductions like home office, medical expenses, and investment fees. A five-minute review can save hundreds or thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Maintaining this in a spreadsheet and updating it yearly can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

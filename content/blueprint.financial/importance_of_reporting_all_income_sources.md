Accurately reporting all income sources is crucial during tax season to avoid costly penalties and potential audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has sophisticated methods to track income and cross-reference it against filed tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Consequences of Unreported Income

Forgetting to report all income is one of the [[common_tax_filing_mistakes_to_avoid | common tax filing mistakes to avoid]] that can lead to significant issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Types of Income the CRA Tracks
The CRA has access to various income records, including T4s (employment income), T5s (investment income), and other slips, which they use to verify your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This includes:
*   Employment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Side hustle earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Investment dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now directly report income to the CRA, making unreported earnings from these sources likely to trigger an automatic reassessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Penalties for Missed Income
If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return, and have also missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This penalty is 10% of the unreported income, split as 5% federally and 5% provincially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Unreported income can also lead to potential audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## How to Ensure All Income is Reported

To avoid these costly penalties and issues, it is essential to ensure all income sources are accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

*   **Check My CRA Account**: Always check your My CRA account before filing to confirm that all tax slips have been included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Keep Accurate Records**: Maintaining accurate records for all income sources helps prevent unexpected tax surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Foreign Assets and Cryptocurrency
It is also crucial to report foreign assets and cryptocurrency gains:
*   **Foreign Assets**: If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (including stocks, real estate, or offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Failure to do so can result in hefty penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency**: Unreported gains from selling or trading cryptocurrency can lead to a tax audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Some crypto exchanges now report transactions directly to the CRA, so relying on anonymity is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Keeping detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades is vital for compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Overcontributing to your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can lead to significant penalties, potentially costing you thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, most mistakes are easy to fix, often in just 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Understanding the rules and common pitfalls is crucial for [[strategies_to_avoid_tfsa_penalties | avoiding TFSA penalties]] and maximizing your tax-free growth.

## [[penalties_for_overcontributing_to_a_tfsa | Penalties for Overcontributing to a TFSA]]

Any amount contributed over your TFSA limit is subject to a 1% monthly penalty on the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Fixing an overcontribution typically involves withdrawing the excess amount and may require negotiation with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), which can be time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Common Overcontribution Mistakes

Three common "gotchas" can lead to accidental TFSA overcontributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>:

### 1. Trusting the CRA's Contribution Limits Alone
The CRA's website may not always immediately reflect recent transactions, which can lead to accidental overcontributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. It's crucial to keep your own records of contributions and withdrawals to accurately track your available room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This ensures you know exactly how much room you have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### 2. Re-contributing in the Same Year
If you withdraw money from your TFSA, re-contributing it in the same year does not reset your contribution room immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The contribution room from a withdrawal is not restored until the next calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. If you are at your limit and re-contribute too soon, you could face [[penalties_for_overcontributing_to_a_tfsa | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It is best to wait until the following year to re-contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### 3. Not Transferring Investments In-Kind
When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then re-depositing the money into your TFSA can inadvertently cause [[penalties_for_overcontributing_to_a_tfsa | overcontribution issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. To avoid this, you can transfer investments "in kind" (without selling them) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. However, even with in-kind transfers, caution regarding timing is necessary to avoid unintentionally reducing your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Important Technical Aspects of TFSA Contribution Room

### Gains and Losses Do Not Impact Contribution Room
A common misconception is that investment gains or losses within your TFSA affect your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The reality is that your TFSA contribution room is only based on your deposits and withdrawals, not on the performance of your investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Whether your investments significantly increase or decrease in value, your TFSA limits remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This means you can focus on contributions and growth without worrying about impacting your contribution space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

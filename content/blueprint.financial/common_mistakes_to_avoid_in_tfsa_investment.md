## [[common_mistakes_and_misconceptions_about_the_tfsa | Common Mistakes to Avoid]]

Even with a solid plan, certain missteps can hinder your TFSA growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Here are some common mistakes and why they can be costly:

### [[risks_of_highrisk_investments_in_tfsa | Taking on Too Much Risk]]

Some investors seek extreme growth by chasing speculative investments like meme stocks or cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. While these can offer massive returns, they often come with significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

**Why it's a problem:**
*   High-risk investments are extremely volatile and unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   The chances of losing all your money are much higher than achieving sustained high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   Recovering from significant losses can take years and derail your TFSA growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Many investors mistakenly believe achieving consistent extreme returns (e.g., 100% annually) is easy, when it is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### [[risks_of_treating_tfsa_as_a_savings_account | Playing It Too Safe]]

On the other hand, some investors stick with low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or even just cash accounts, believing it's the safest route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. While these options protect your principal, they significantly limit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. For example, at a 2% return, $10,000 would take 66 years to reach $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

**Why it's a problem:**
*   Low returns barely outpace inflation, meaning your purchasing power diminishes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   You miss out on the compounding potential of higher-growth investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Trying to Time the Market

Many investors attempt to buy low and sell high, believing they can predict market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While appealing, this strategy is very difficult to execute consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

**Why it's a problem:**
*   Most people miss out on the best-performing market days by waiting on the sidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Even professionals struggle to time the market accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   The cost of getting it wrong can far outweigh potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   Staying invested through market fluctuations typically outperforms attempts to predict swings for most retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Ignoring Fees

High fees, such as those associated with mutual funds, can significantly eat into your returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

**Why it's a problem:**
*   A 2% management fee on a $100,000 portfolio can cost tens of thousands of dollars over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   Low-cost options like ETFs offer similar market exposure with significantly lower fees, allowing more of your money to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Not Understanding Your Investments and Risk Tolerance

Before committing to any investment, it's crucial to understand how it works and whether it aligns with your risk tolerance and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It's easy to be tempted by trendy assets like Bitcoin or hot tech stocks, but if you don't fully understand the investment and can't handle the risk, it could derail your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

**Why it's important:**
*   Many investors overestimate their ability to handle risk, leading to poor decisions when markets become volatile and investments drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Be honest with yourself and build a portfolio that suits your comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The landscape of pension systems in Canada has undergone significant changes, particularly impacting how individuals plan for and experience [[retirement income and financial security in Canada | retirement]]. The traditional model of guaranteed lifetime income has shifted, leading to greater personal responsibility for retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution Plans

For an extended period, many Canadians relied on defined benefit pensions, which offered a predictable, lifelong income backed by their employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. However, this type of pension is now less common, especially within the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

In contrast, private sector workers are more likely to have a defined contribution plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. With these plans, the retirement income is not guaranteed but instead depends on the performance of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. This places more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Decreased Workplace Pension Coverage

Overall, workplace pension coverage in Canada has declined. Only 37.5% of all paid workers are covered by a workplace pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. This means the majority of Canadians must manage their own retirement savings through vehicles like RRSPs, TFSAs, or other personal savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. While pension coverage remains strong in some sectors, for many, retirement planning has become a more "Do-It-Yourself" endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Role of [[Canada Pension Plan 2025 updates | CPP]] and OAS

The [[Canada Pension Plan contribution updates in 2025 | CPP]] and Old Age Security (OAS) remain fundamental components of retirement income in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. While standard eligibility often starts at age 65, individuals can choose to delay their [[Canada Pension Plan 2025 updates | CPP]] benefits to secure a higher monthly payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

However, simply delaying [[Future of Canada Pension Plan CPP | CPP]] without a strategic withdrawal plan from other savings (like RRSPs) can lead to shortfalls in earlier retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. A balanced approach that combines delaying [[Canada Pension Plan 2025 updates | CPP]] with gradual, tax-efficient withdrawals from registered accounts can lead to a more stable and financially secure [[retirement income and financial security in Canada | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. This strategic sequencing of payments and withdrawals can significantly improve financial outcomes without necessarily requiring a substantial increase in savings or a drastic extension of working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

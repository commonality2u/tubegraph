Understanding monthly spending in retirement is a common concern for individuals planning their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article breaks down the [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average spending for Canadian retirees]], what they spend their money on, and how spending changes through different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, aged 65 and over, was $61,800 annually or $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The largest portion of expenditures for retirees in Canada goes to shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Even with many retirees owning their homes, significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | budgeting]] for ongoing home-related expenses even after mortgage payments end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Here's a breakdown of average monthly spending by category:
*   **Shelter**: $1,151 per month, accounting for 22.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Food**: $639 per month, or 12.4% of monthly spending, including groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: 5.6% of total monthly spending, due to increased medical needs as people age, even with free healthcare in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Personal insurance and pensions**: 5.4% of monthly spending, underscoring the need for continued [[strategies_for_financial_security_in_retirement | financial security in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household operations**: 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Costs Decrease Throughout Life

Household spending patterns [[changes_in_spending_habits_as_retirees_age | change significantly]] as individuals progress through different phases of life, from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

*   **Middle-aged households (40-54)**: Spending is at its highest, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This peak is driven by larger family needs, increased food consumption, education costs for children, and a stronger focus on [[retirement_savings_growth_strategies | saving and investing for retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-retirement households (55-64)**: Spending decreases slightly to about $99,250 annually or $8,237 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There is also a bigger focus on paying off mortgages and preparing further for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired households (65+)**: Spending drops further to $61,800 annually or $5,150 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there is less spending on luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Within the retirement phase itself, there are generally three distinct spending phases: high, medium, and low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Consider Alex, a Canadian retiree, as an example of these [[changes_in_spending_habits_as_retirees_age | changes in household expenses]]:

*   **Early Retirement (65-70 years old) - High Spending Phase**
    *   Alex spends approximately $70,000 annually or $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Housing costs are still high, though reduced since the mortgage is paid off (managing maintenance and property taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs decrease significantly without daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Healthcare costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Food costs are slightly less as he dines out less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Alex enjoys spending on hobbies and travel, taking advantage of newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years old) - Medium Spending Phase**
    *   Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000 or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs reduce further as he travels less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   Food costs remain stable or decrease as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Spending on travel also reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Later Retirement (After 75 years old) - Low Spending Phase**
    *   Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year or around $4,160 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
    *   Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Transportation costs are significantly lower as he rarely travels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   Healthcare becomes a major expense, including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
    *   Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   Travel spending halts, with a focus on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Summary of Retirement Spending Phases

As retirees become less active, they are likely to spend less money, a pattern observed with many clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

| Phase             | Age Range     | Spending Pattern                                                                                               |
| :---------------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High Spending** | 65-70         | Increased activity, travel, and leisure activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.                                    |
| **Medium Spending** | 70-75         | Spending stabilizes, with a shift to more home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.                             |
| **Low Spending**  | 75+           | Significant decline in discretionary spending, with a focus on essential living and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. |

## Real-Life Client Observations

Based on observations, retirees typically spend anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000-$8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-end households might spend $5,000 to $9,000 per month or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases, similar to Alex's example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there is about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For instance, an annual spend of $100,000 in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This reduction can be attributed to factors such as lowering housing costs, less need for transportation, and overall [[changes_in_spending_habits_as_retirees_age | lifestyle changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, their spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these [[changes_in_spending_habits_as_retirees_age | trends]] can help in [[defining_retirement_goals_and_budgeting | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] by anticipating changes in spending habits, ensuring enough savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

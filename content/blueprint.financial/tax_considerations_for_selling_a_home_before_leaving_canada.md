When planning to [[steps_for_moving_abroad_from_canada | move abroad]] permanently, managing your finances carefully is crucial to avoid significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This includes understanding the tax implications of your real estate. A special tip for those considering [[reasons_for_leaving_canada | leaving Canada]] is to consider selling your home before you depart, which could save tens of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Principal Residence Exemption

For residents of Canada, selling your principal residence is generally not subject to tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This means if you are a resident of Canada when you sell your home, any appreciation in its value (capital gain) is usually tax-free.

## Risks of Selling After Becoming a Non-Resident

Selling your principal residence after you become a non-resident can result in significant taxes due to large capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### Example Scenario
Consider the following:
*   You buy your home for $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   Its value appreciates to $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   You decide to [[steps_for_moving_abroad_from_canada | move abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

If you sell the home *after* you become a non-resident, you might have to pay capital gains tax on the $300,000 increase in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Depending on your residency status and applicable tax treaties, this could lead to a substantial tax bill, potentially exceeding $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This considerable tax liability could be entirely avoided if the property was sold before [[reasons_for_leaving_canada | leaving Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Recommendation

It is a smart financial move to sell your home *before* you officially [[steps_for_moving_abroad_from_canada | move abroad]] and become a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Professional Advice

If you are seriously considering [[steps_for_moving_abroad_from_canada | moving abroad]], it is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Ideally, you should seek advice from professionals in both Canada and your intended country of residence to fully understand the specific details and implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Some financial firms collaborate with accountants specializing in expat services to provide tailored advice and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

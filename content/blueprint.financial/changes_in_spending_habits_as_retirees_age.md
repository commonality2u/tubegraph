Understanding monthly spending in retirement is a common concern for individuals planning their post-work lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down the [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | average spending for Canadian retirees]], what they spend their money on, and how spending changes through different [[stages_of_retirement_spending | stages of retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees (65+)

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees aged 65 and over is $61,800 annually, which equates to $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The largest portions of expenditures for retirees in Canada are allocated to:
*   **Shelter** The largest portion of spending goes to shelter, including the cost of main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. On average, retirees spend about $13,814 annually on shelter, which is $1,151 per month and accounts for 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This highlights the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses like maintenance, property taxes, and utilities, even after mortgages are paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food** Another significant category is food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Retirees spend approximately $7,667 annually on food, averaging $639 per month or 12.4% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation** While generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals, transportation still represents 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare** Despite free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation in retirement due to increased medical needs as people age, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions** These take up a substantial portion at 5.4% of monthly spending, emphasizing the need for continued financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations** Expenses for maintaining the home amount to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Costs Decrease Throughout Life

Household spending patterns evolve significantly with age, decreasing as individuals move from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

*   **Middle-Aged Households (Ages 40-54)** This period typically sees the highest spending, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This peak is driven by higher family needs, such as larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, alongside a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (Ages 55-64)** Spending begins to decrease slightly in this phase, averaging $99,250 annually or $8,237 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There is also an increased focus on paying off mortgages and preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (Ages 65+)** Spending drops further to an average of $61,800 annually or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs like housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Transportation costs decline as work-related travel reduces, and there's less spending on luxuries, with a greater emphasis on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## [[stages_of_retirement_spending | Stages of Retirement Spending]]

Retirement spending generally follows three phases: a high-spending phase, a medium-spending phase, and a low-spending phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Example: Alex's Spending Through Retirement

Using Alex, a Canadian retiree, as an example, these changes become clearer:

*   **Early Retirement (Ages 65-70)** Alex spends about $70,000 annually, or around $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Housing costs remain high, despite the mortgage being paid off, due to maintenance and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Transportation costs decrease significantly with no daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Healthcare costs begin to rise, and food spending slightly decreases as dining out becomes less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Alex also enjoys spending on hobbies and travel in this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Mid-Retirement (Ages 70-75)** Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000, or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, possibly due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Transportation costs reduce further as travel lessens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Food costs remain stable or decrease further, and spending on travel reduces, with more focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Later Retirement (Ages 75+)** Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year, or around $4,160 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Transportation costs are significantly lower as travel becomes rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Healthcare becomes a major expense, including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Food expenses are relatively low due to simpler dietary needs, and travel spending halts, with Alex focusing more on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Real-Life Observations

Financial advisors often observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. On average, retirees spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-income households might spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year as time goes on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This reduction is attributed to factors like lowering housing costs, decreased transportation needs, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, their spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends can help in planning a sustainable retirement budget by anticipating changes in spending habits, ensuring enough savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

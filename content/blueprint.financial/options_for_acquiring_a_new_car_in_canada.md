The used car market experienced a significant jump of 40% during the pandemic, but with prices now stabilizing, many individuals are considering their options for their next car purchase: buying, leasing, or financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While there isn't a single answer that fits everyone, understanding the different approaches is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Comparing Options with an Online Calculator

A useful tool for comparing buying versus leasing is an online calculator, such as the one found at Bankrate.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This calculator can be used for any car, regardless of location, including Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

To use the calculator, you'll need to plug in a few numbers:

1.  **Vehicle Information**: Start by choosing the vehicle you intend to purchase or lease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The most accurate numbers come from a dealership quote for financing and leasing, but company websites can also provide this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, a Ford F-150 might have a finance price of $49,950 at 48 months with a 1.99% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   **Down Payment**: Enter your intended down payment (e.g., zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Sales Tax Rate**: Input your local sales tax rate (e.g., 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Investment Rate of Return**: This represents the opportunity cost of investing your money elsewhere instead of using it for the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A higher return makes buying a worse option compared to leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
        *   Conservative investors might use 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
        *   Middle-of-the-road investors might use 5-6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
        *   Aggressive investors might use 7% and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  **Buy Option Inputs**: Enter the term (e.g., 48 months), interest rate (e.g., 2%), and any associated fees (e.g., $2,495) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Always confirm rates with the dealership, as advertised low rates may not apply to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
3.  **Depreciation Rate**: This is a critical factor in the calculation, as it significantly impacts the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Car depreciation can be thought of as an iceberg, with a large chunk of value melting away in the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Methods to estimate depreciation**:
        *   **Research average rates**: New cars typically lose about 20% in the first year and 15% each year for the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
        *   **Online estimators**: Websites like Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book offer tools to estimate depreciation based on make, model, year, and mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
        *   **Current marketplaces**: Checking sites like AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji for similar listings provides real-time insight into a car's current value and depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This method is preferred for its accuracy over estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
4.  **Lease Option Inputs**: Similar to buying, enter the term (e.g., 48 months), interest rate (e.g., 4.49%), and fees (e.g., $2,495) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
    *   **Residual Percent**: This is the car's value at the end of the lease term, typically between 40-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. It's provided by the dealership and is generally not negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

By adjusting the investment rate of return or the annual depreciation, you can significantly impact the net cost of buying versus leasing, revealing which option is more financially favorable under different assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This highlights the importance of accurately estimating these variables for your [[using_online_calculators_for_car_financing_decisions | car financing decisions]].

## Key Financial Takeaways

From the calculator example, here are the main conclusions:

*   **High Resale Value**: If a vehicle maintains a high resale value, buying or financing is generally more cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value**: If a vehicle has a low resale value, leasing becomes more cost-effective, especially if some of the costs can be written off for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Cost**: When buying outright or making a large down payment, consider the opportunity cost of what that money could have earned if invested elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Market Unpredictability**: All these calculations are estimates, as factors like the car's future resale value and investment returns are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. For instance, those who leased in 2017 missed out on profiting from the soaring used car prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, where owning would have allowed them to capitalize on the market shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Non-Financial Considerations

Since predicting the market is challenging, non-financial factors often weigh more heavily in the buy-or-lease decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## The Case for Buying Used

Buying a used car is frequently the most financially prudent choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. While new cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years, buying a car that is 3 to 5 years old allows you to avoid this initial rapid depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This "sweet spot" provides more value for your money and typically means the car is not yet old enough to have major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Additionally, used cars usually come with lower insurance costs and less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. With some research, a reliable, well-priced used car with comparable or better features than a new one can often be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

In the context of recent car market fluctuations, making an informed financial choice is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. For personalized financial guidance on this or other [[actionable_tips_for_managing_personal_finances_in_canada | personal finance topics]], consulting with a financial professional can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Both the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) offer significant investment potential, allowing for tax-deferred growth [02:37:40]. This means taxes are not paid on gains while investments grow, enabling compounding over time [02:45:50].

## Investment Opportunities

Both accounts provide excellent investment opportunities, supporting a wide range of investment options including:
*   Stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>
*   Bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>
*   Mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>
*   ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>

The FHSA, despite being labeled a "savings account," functions as both a savings and investment account, allowing for strategic investments with significant growth potential, similar to an RRSP [02:49:50]. Investors are not just parking cash but can build a well-diversified investment portfolio that grows tax-deferred in either account [03:14:15].

## Investment Potential Comparison

When comparing the investment potential, there is no clear winner between the FHSA and RRSP as they offer the same powerful investment opportunities and allow for tax-deferred growth [03:08:40]. The primary difference lies in how funds are withdrawn, not in how they are invested [03:27:00].

## Specific Situations Favoring RRSP for Investments

While generally equal in investment potential, there are [[situations_where_rrsp_is_advantageous_over_fhsa | two key situations]] where the RRSP is the smarter choice for investments:

### US Stocks and Dividends
If investing in US stocks, the RRSP offers a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:50">[07:29:50]</a>.
*   **FHSA:** Any dividends earned from US stocks within an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can considerably reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:30">[07:31:30]</a>.
*   **RRSP:** Thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, this 15% withholding tax is avoided entirely when investing in US stocks through an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

It is recommended to invest in US stocks through an RRSP, not an FHSA, to bypass this withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:50">[07:49:50]</a>.

### Employer Matching
The RRSP also has an advantage if an employer offers to match contributions, as this is essentially free money that boosts [[retirement_savings_considerations_with_fhsa_and_rrsp | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:30">[07:58:30]</a>. For example, if an employer matches up to $5,000 per year, a $5,000 contribution results in a total of $10,000 in the RRSP for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

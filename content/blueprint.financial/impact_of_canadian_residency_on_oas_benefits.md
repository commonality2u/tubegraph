The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is not automatic, and many individuals, particularly immigrants, are surprised to find they do not qualify for the full amount or any at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), which is based on working contributions, OAS is entirely based on an individual's residency in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Key Residency Requirements for OAS

There are three critical residency periods to understand for OAS eligibility:

*   **10 Years of Residency**: This is the minimum requirement to receive any OAS benefits at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **40 Years of Residency**: To qualify for the full OAS payment, an individual must have resided in Canada for 40 years after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **20 Years of Residency (for Non-Residents)**: This is particularly important for immigrants. If you plan to [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | retire abroad]], you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after the age of 18 to continue receiving OAS outside the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Calculating Partial OAS

If an individual has not met the 40-year residency requirement, their OAS payment will be prorated based on their years of residency. For example, an individual who immigrated to Canada at age 50 and retired at 65 would have only 15 years of residency after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. In this scenario, they would receive 15 out of 40 years of OAS payments, amounting to approximately 37.5% of the full OAS amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Impact of Retiring Abroad on OAS

A significant risk for immigrants is deciding to move back to their home country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. If they do not meet the 20-year minimum residency requirement, they could lose their OAS benefits entirely once they leave Canada, depending on their destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## International Social Security Agreements

Canada has international social security agreements with approximately 50 countries, including the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These agreements can help individuals qualify for OAS even if they haven't spent the full time in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

For example, if an individual lived in Canada for 7 years and in the UK for 13 years, they might still qualify for OAS under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. These agreements allow Canada to count time spent in certain other countries toward the 10- or 20-year residency minimums for OAS eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, it's crucial to note that these agreements do *not* count towards the full 40 years required for 100% OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Therefore, individuals will likely still receive only a partial OAS benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Strategies for Immigrants Regarding OAS

Immigrants who arrive in Canada later in life or plan to [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | retire abroad]] may receive a fraction of the full OAS or even lose it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. To mitigate this:

*   **Delay OAS Withdrawal**: Delaying OAS until age 70 can increase the monthly benefit by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Check Social Security Agreements**: Verify if Canada has a social security agreement with your country of origin or intended retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This can help qualify for partial OAS, even if the full 20-year residency for portability isn't met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. If close to the 20-year threshold and planning to retire in a country without an agreement, it might be beneficial to delay moving for a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Understand Residency Rules**: Be fully aware that OAS will stop if you leave Canada for more than six months, unless covered by a social security agreement or having met the 20-year non-residency rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Coordinate Withdrawals**: Strategically coordinate RRSP and TFSA withdrawals to reduce taxable income and potentially avoid OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Income Splitting**: Consider using income splitting with a spouse or family member to lower the overall tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Even without personal savings or a pension, Canadian government benefits like OAS and CPP can be worth over $800,000 over a lifetime, especially when considering inflation adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. However, for immigrants who arrive later in life or retire abroad, this amount can be significantly reduced or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.</p>

Deciding when to start your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices you can make, and it is closely tied to your estimated life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin receiving CPP at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 often proves optimal for many, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

Your CPP decision should be viewed as part of a retirement jigsaw puzzle, where pieces like life expectancy, investment returns, and income streams must fit together to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Basic CPP Principles and Timing

Most Canadians claim CPP at age 60, with over 70% starting their benefits precisely at age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. However, there are many more options, including ages 61 to 64 and 66 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting Early (Age 60):** Choosing to start CPP at 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those who live beyond around age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Delaying (Age 70):** Waiting until 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, a person qualifying for $1,000 per month at 65 would receive $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Actuarial Insights into Optimal Timing

A detailed 2020 actuarial study on when to start CPP highlights the importance of life expectancy and expected investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 60
This option is generally best for those who need immediate income or have health concerns leading to a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. While it ensures early access to funds, it results in permanently reduced lifetime payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It can also be beneficial for those whose investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, allowing them to invest CPP payments and potentially come out ahead, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For low-income retirees, starting at 60 can help avoid clawbacks on benefits like the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 65
This "default" option offers a balance, providing steady payments without the immediate need for significant savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Payments equalize with the 70-option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those unsure of their longevity or investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to Age 70
Delaying provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, with payments increasing by the maximum amount and being inflation-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for individuals with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to around 6-8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For most, delaying CPP becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments start to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

The common thread among these scenarios is the critical [[impact_of_longer_life_expectancy_on_retirement_planning | importance of your life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Estimating Your Life Expectancy

Estimating how long you'll live is a crucial piece of the CPP puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Insights from the 2020 CPP Report
The 2020 CPP take-up decision report highlights the odds of living past age 80 based on gender and longevity expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:
*   **Gender Differences:** Women tend to live longer than men, with 82% of women likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Delaying CPP is especially beneficial for women seeking secure, inflation-protected income in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle and Family History:** A healthy lifestyle or a family history of long life increases the odds of living longer (79% for men, 85% for women to live past 80), making delayed CPP a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **General Trend:** Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Most retirees would benefit from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Stats Canada Life Expectancy Data
Recent data from Stats Canada further emphasizes average life expectancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Age-Dependent Expectancy:** The older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. For example, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman of the same age can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Key Takeaways:**
    *   Life expectancy in Canada is generally longer than most people realize, often surpassing the conventional wisdom of 80 or 82, particularly for those already middle-aged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Women tend to benefit more from delaying CPP because they generally live longer across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Delaying CPP to age 70 can provide a higher, inflation-protected income for their longer retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Men with shorter life expectancies should balance delaying CPP with their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   Delaying CPP can act as "longevity insurance," especially for women, who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Strategic planning, integrating CPP timing with RSP withdrawals and TFS savings, is crucial for optimizing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Online Life Expectancy Calculators
Several online calculators can provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass:** Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It's quick (about 5 minutes) and offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Living to 100:** Based on the New England Centenarian Study, this tool delves deeper into health and habits, providing personalized feedback over 10-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

While these calculators offer tailored outlooks compared to general statistics, their results can vary, so they should be taken with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### [[methods_to_estimate_cpp_benefits | Methods to Refine Life Expectancy Estimates]]
For a deeper dive into refining your life expectancy estimations, consider:
*   **Genetic Testing:** Can uncover potential health predispositions and longevity factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Evaluations:** Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Biological Age Testing:** Advanced tests measuring aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Health Screenings:** Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes can significantly impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Using a CPP Present Value Calculator

Instead of solely relying on CPP Break-Even tables, a CPP present value calculator offers a more accurate estimate by incorporating factors like the investment rate of return and the present value of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

This calculator (found on TaxTips) allows you to input:
*   Estimated monthly benefit at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Estimated annual indexation of CPP (inflation rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   Desired CPP start ages to evaluate (e.g., 60, 65, 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   Your estimated life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   Your estimated rate of return on investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### How Life Expectancy Impacts Results
Using the calculator, if a woman in her 50s is expected to live to 86 with a 2% rate of return, delaying CPP to 70 shows a significantly higher present value ($320,000) compared to starting at 65 ($286,000) or 60 ($222,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

However, adjustments to variables like the rate of return or life expectancy drastically alter the results:
*   **Higher Rate of Return:** A 4% rate of return closes the gap between starting ages, making age 65 potentially more comparable to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. At 6%, age 65 and 70 become even more similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Extended Life Expectancy (e.g., 100):** If you live to 100, age 70 becomes the clear optimal choice, providing over $130,000 more in present value compared to starting at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The cumulative payments can be significantly higher ($1 million vs. $550,000 for age 60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Shorter Life Expectancy (e.g., 72):** If you pass away early, around 72, it becomes clear that taking CPP at age 60 was the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

This calculator highlights how crucial your estimated life expectancy is to determining the optimal CPP start age, especially when considering the time value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

## Comprehensive CPP Planning

Deciding when to start CPP is a complex puzzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Key considerations include:
*   **Life Expectancy and Break-Even Points:** Understanding how long you're likely to live and when delaying CPP begins to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies:** How CPP income interacts with your overall tax situation can significantly reduce or increase your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation:** Whether delaying CPP could help you avoid penalties related to Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks, or if starting earlier is better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination:** Integrating CPP with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other retirement income sources to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Most often, delaying CPP into the late 60s or 70s proves beneficial for clients, but exceptions exist, making personalized scenario analysis valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

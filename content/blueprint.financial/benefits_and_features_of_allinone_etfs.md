[[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | All-in-one ETFs]], also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by combining multiple ETFs into a single fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. They provide instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets, eliminating the need to select individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## What All-in-One ETFs Invest In

As an example, Vanguard VGRO, one of Canada's most trusted [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETFs]] with over $6 billion in assets, offers exposure to a wide range of global stocks and bonds, creating an instantly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Asset Allocation in VGRO

*   **Stocks**: VGRO allocates 80% of its assets to stocks, including a mix of Canadian, U.S., international, and emerging market equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This provides access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Bonds**: The remaining 20% is allocated to a blend of Canadian and global bonds, which helps stabilize the portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

This structure allows for broad diversification, spreading investments across various countries, industries, and asset classes to reduce risk and potentially enhance returns, all while maintaining a low management expense ratio (MER) of 0.24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Top holdings in VGRO include major companies like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, RBC, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Performance Snapshot

An investment of $10,000 in VGRO from January 2020 to 2025 would have grown to approximately $16,000, demonstrating the effectiveness of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Key Benefits of All-in-One ETFs

Investors favor [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETFs]] for several compelling reasons:

*   **Low-Cost Alternative to Mutual Funds**: A significant advantage is their low fee structure, typically ranging from 0.2% to 0.25% MER, which is substantially lower than traditional [[mutual_funds_vs_etfs_in_canada | mutual funds in Canada]] that often charge around 2% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Automatic Rebalancing**: [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | All-in-one ETFs]] automatically buy and sell assets within the fund to maintain the target stock-to-bond ratio, ensuring the portfolio remains aligned with its intended asset mix without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Smaller Accounts**: For those beginning their investment journey with accounts like a TFSA or RRSP, a single [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETF]] offers instant diversification, negating the need to spread money across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Extensive Diversification and Time-Saving**: Instead of researching and purchasing numerous stocks and bonds, investors gain a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of global investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This simplifies investing, adhering to the philosophy that investing should be passive and straightforward, like "watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Matching Risk Tolerance to Asset Allocation

The key to [[how_to_choose_the_right_allinone_etf | choosing the right one]] is to determine your comfort level with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

*   **Higher Risk, Higher Returns**: ETFs with 100% stocks and 0% bonds (e.g., VQ T, XEQT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Balanced Approach (Growth)**: 80% stocks and 20% bonds (e.g., VGRO, XGRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Your risk tolerance and investment goals should drive your decision, not merely the ETF provider, as long as fees are comparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even with their simplicity, investors can make mistakes that hinder returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Avoiding these can help maximize the benefits of [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETFs]]:

*   **Dishonest Investor Questionnaire Answers**: Failing to answer risk assessment questions truthfully can lead to an inappropriate ETF choice. Being too conservative may limit growth, while being too aggressive could cause panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Excessive Tweaking**: The "set it and forget it" nature of [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETFs]] is a major advantage. Constantly checking accounts, making unnecessary changes, or selling due to market swings can significantly hurt long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Buying Too Many ETFs in One Account**: [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | All-in-one ETFs]] are designed to be standalone investments per account. Adding multiple [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETFs]] or combining them with other ETFs can disrupt their built-in balance and complicate your portfolio, potentially altering your intended asset allocation and risk level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. For example, VGRO already diversifies across 13,000 companies, providing ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

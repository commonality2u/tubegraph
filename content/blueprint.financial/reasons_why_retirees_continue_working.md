Retirement doesn't always signify a complete departure from work for many Canadians. A significant number of seniors continue [[reasons_canadians_are_working_longer_and_retiring_later | working longer and retiring later]] into their later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In 2022, over 1.9 million Canadians aged 65 and older reported employment income, collectively earning $58.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Several factors contribute to this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>:

## [[factors_influencing_retirement_decisions | Financial Necessities]]
For some retirees, continuing to work is a direct result of not having enough savings to cover all their expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is considered the primary reason for many seniors to keep working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_retirement_in_canada | Inflation Pressure]]
Rising costs of living make it increasingly difficult for retirees to rely solely on their pensions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Working provides a necessary buffer against the eroding purchasing power of their fixed incomes.

## Personal Fulfillment
Beyond financial considerations, many seniors continue working because they simply enjoy staying active in the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This engagement can take various forms, including part-time jobs, consulting, or even starting small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

While working can be an excellent way to [[supplemental_income_strategies_for_retirees | supplement income]] in retirement, it is not the only approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. With effective financial planning, many retirees can achieve a sustainable financial future without having to extend their employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Despite their popularity in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024, actively managed mutual funds often exhibit significant underperformance when compared to their respective market benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This underperformance is a key concern for investors, impacting their potential long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Consistent Low Returns

A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada have consistently [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | underperformed]] their benchmarks over various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This trend highlights a systemic issue within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Key Statistics on Underperformance

*   **Canadian Equity Funds (10-Year Period)**: Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | underperformed]] their benchmark, the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While the S&P TSX Composite Index achieved an annualized return of 7.62% during this time, Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This difference is notably close to the average 2% management fees charged by many funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Specific Categories**:
    *   **Canadian-Focused Equity Funds**: 98% [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | underperformed]] their benchmark over the same 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds**: 88.6% fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Small to Mid-Cap Equity Funds**: 76.19% [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | underperformed]] their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Shorter Periods**: Even over shorter periods like five and three years, the majority of these funds continue to lag behind their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Impact of High Fees

A primary reason for the underperformance of Canadian mutual funds is the [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] they charge, which are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. These seemingly small percentages, such as a 2% management fee, can significantly erode investment returns over the long term due to the power of compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. For example, a $100,000 investment over 20 years could see a difference of $122,000 in potential returns due to a 2% annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Over 30 years, this difference can be as high as $329,000, or 43% of potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Misleading Marketing and Survivorship Bias

Banks and financial institutions often employ marketing tactics that highlight only the top-performing mutual funds, ignoring those that [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | underperformed]] or were closed/merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This selective reporting creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The concept of **survivorship bias** is crucial to understanding this deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Performance reports often only include "surviving" funds, excluding poorly performing funds that were liquidated or merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This omission creates a misleadingly positive picture of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

*   Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   On average, across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived, and for Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Tax Inefficiency Concerns

Beyond fees, mutual funds can be [[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax inefficient]], especially when held in non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

*   **Capital Gains Distributions**: Mutual funds distribute realized capital gains to investors annually, meaning investors can incur tax liabilities even without selling shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed funds often engage in frequent trading, leading to short-term capital gains taxed at higher regular income tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing**: Investors have no control over when fund managers realize gains or losses, potentially leading to taxable events at inconvenient times and increasing tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

To avoid these [[tax_inefficiencies_of_holding_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]], investing in accounts like a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Why Mutual Funds Remain Popular Despite Underperformance

Despite these drawbacks, mutual funds remain popular due to:

*   **Accessibility and Convenience**: They are widely available through aggressive distribution channels like banks on "every corner," making them easy for average investors to access and diversify without extensive market knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Sales Targets**: Banks and financial advisors often push mutual funds due to aggressive sales targets, as they are a high-profit product for financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Perceived Professional Management**: Investors are drawn to the idea of professional portfolio managers making informed decisions, despite data showing consistent underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Marketing, such as Morningstar's five-star ratings, can mislead investors into believing in better performance, even when studies show such funds often [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | underperform]] in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | Alternatives to Mutual Funds]]

Given the consistent underperformance and [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] of actively managed mutual funds, several [[alternatives_to_mutual_funds_for_canadian_investors | alternatives]] offer better potential for returns and lower costs:

*   **Robo-Advisors**: Offer a convenient and cost-effective way to invest with lower fees than traditional mutual funds, typically about half the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Hiring a Portfolio Manager**: Can provide personalized investment strategies with professional management, often at lower fees than mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Building Your Own ETF Portfolio**: Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are gaining popularity over mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. ETFs offer greater flexibility, lower fees, and better tax efficiency compared to mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Stock Portfolio**: This hands-on approach allows direct control over investments, minimizes fees, and offers tailored portfolios, but requires significant knowledge, research, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

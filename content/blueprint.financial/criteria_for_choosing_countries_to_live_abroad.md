Many Canadians are considering moving abroad due to rising living expenses, seeking experiences like sunrises in Portugal or sunsets in Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Nearly 40% of new Canadians are contemplating leaving their province or even the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. When thinking about [[cultural_experiences_and_living_conditions_in_different_countries | moving abroad]], it's crucial to prioritize what truly matters, as no country is "perfect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Top Factors to Consider

Seven key factors often influence a person's decision when [[cultural_experiences_and_living_conditions_in_different_countries | moving abroad]]:

*   **Healthcare** Ensuring access to good doctors and hospitals, and adequate health insurance coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living** Understanding expenses for housing, groceries, and daily life to avoid financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This is a significant [[financial_factors_for_moving_abroad | financial factor for moving abroad]].
*   **Safety** Assessing crime rates, political stability, and potential natural disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Job Market** Important for those seeking employment or planning to work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Visa and Citizenship** Evaluating the ease of obtaining and maintaining a [[visa_and_residency_options_in_various_countries | visa]], and the process for long-term citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Taxes** Understanding income and property tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Weather** A major consideration, especially for Canadians looking for warmer climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

While this list provides a good starting point, individuals should identify their top three to five priorities to evaluate potential countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Applying the Criteria: An Example

Consider Homer, who prioritized healthcare, [[financial_factors_for_moving_abroad | cost of living]], and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. His research led him to consider Spain, Portugal, and New Zealand due to their strong healthcare systems, lower costs compared to Canada, and solid safety records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Conversely, he avoided Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico due to inconsistent healthcare, varying living costs, and safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Research tools like Nomad List and Numbeo can be very helpful for evaluating [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_in | countries]] and their [[financial_factors_for_moving_abroad | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

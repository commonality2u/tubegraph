For high-net-worth households and business owners, [[Family Trusts as a Wealth Management Tool | Family Trusts]] and Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) provide effective methods for wealth management, tax reduction, and efficient asset transfer to future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## [[Family Trusts as a Wealth Management Tool | How Family Trusts Help Save on Taxes]]
A [[Family Trusts as a Wealth Management Tool | Family Trust]] can be a flexible component of a retirement plan, enabling [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | tax-saving strategies]] such as income splitting, capital gains exemptions, and bypassing probate fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Income Splitting
Income generated from assets held within a trust can potentially be distributed to family members in lower tax brackets, thereby lowering the household's total tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. For instance, if investment income is held in the trust, it can be directed to family members with a lower tax rate, leading to collective tax savings for the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### Capital Gains Exemption
For business owners, a trust can facilitate the distribution of capital gains exemptions among family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. When a business is sold, multiple family members may be able to utilize their capital gains exemptions, significantly reducing the tax impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

### Estate Freeze
A trust can "freeze" the value of assets at their current level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This ensures that any future growth benefits beneficiaries without increasing the taxable amount in the estate, helping to minimize taxes due upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Avoiding Probate Fees
In some provinces, assets held within a trust can bypass the probate process, leading to savings on fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This allows more wealth to be transferred directly to beneficiaries without additional costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### Key Considerations for [[Family Trusts as a Wealth Management Tool | Family Trusts]] in Retirement Planning
*   **Attribution Rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>: Income from transferred assets might still be taxed back to the original owner, which can diminish the benefits of income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Proper structuring of family assets is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **21-Year Rule** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>: Trust assets are considered to be disposed of every 21 years, which triggers capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Strategic planning to transfer assets to beneficiaries before this deadline can help avoid this tax impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Setup and Administrative Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>: Trusts necessitate annual tax filings and meticulous record-keeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Users should anticipate upfront legal fees and ongoing compliance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Individual Pension Plans (IPPs)
IPPs are described as a "business owner's secret weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. They offer a flexible retirement savings instrument, allowing for larger contributions than RRSPs and providing significant tax deductions for the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. IPPs also play a beneficial role in [[Estate planning involving RRIFs | estate planning]] by avoiding the immediate tax burden typically associated with RSP inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### IPPs for Legacy Transfer
An IPP enables family members, such as children, to be included as plan members, making it a tax-efficient method for passing wealth to heirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. For example, a business owner transfers $400,000 from their RSP to an IPP, which then grows to $1.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Upon the owner's death, the children inherit the IPP without an immediate tax liability, only paying taxes upon withdrawal of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This strategy helps them manage their tax impact even beyond the original owner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### [[Comparing RRSPs with IPPs and Family Trusts | IPP vs. RSP Comparison]]
IPPs generally offer greater [[Tax planning strategies for Canadian families and business owners | tax planning strategies]] and retirement savings potential for business owners when compared to RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. An IPP can be viewed as an "exclusive retirement savings tool specifically for business owners," providing perks not found in a regular RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

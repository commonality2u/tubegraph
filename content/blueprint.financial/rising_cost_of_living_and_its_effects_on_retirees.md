Retirees today face a significant challenge due to the [[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirees | rising cost of living]], which often goes unmatched by increases in their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This contrasts with past generations where retirement at 65 was feasible with lower housing costs and shorter life expectancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This [[economic_challenges_and_their_effect_on_retirement_savings | economic challenge]] is a primary reason why more Canadians are choosing to work longer and retire later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Key Areas of Increased Costs

### Shelter Costs
[[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | Shelter costs]] have seen massive increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. As of February 2024, shelter costs were up 6.2% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Mortgage interest rates alone have climbed over 26%, although they have recently begun to decrease slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Both renters and homeowners renewing their mortgages are significantly impacted by these hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Food Prices
[[impact_of_inflation_on_retiree_purchasing_power | Food prices]] have risen by more than 20% since 2020 and continue to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. For those on a fixed income, each trip to the grocery store has a deeper financial impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Health Care Costs
Despite public healthcare in Canada, certain [[health_and_longterm_care_costs_for_single_retirees | healthcare expenses]] are not covered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. These include dental care, glasses, physiotherapy, and prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Such out-of-pocket costs tend to increase with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Impact on Retiree Finances
For individuals relying on government benefits like CPP and OAS, along with personal savings, meeting daily expenses is becoming increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This is particularly true for those who are still renting, carrying debt, or providing financial assistance to family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Related Challenges
### Taxes
Beyond the direct [[inflation_and_retirement_planning | rising costs]], taxes can also significantly reduce a retiree's available income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. [[managing_higher_tax_burden_in_retirement | Managing a higher tax burden in retirement]] is crucial for financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Uncertainty and Volatility
[[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | Market volatility]], unpredictable housing costs, and [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | inflation]], even if better than previous years, remain higher than many retirees initially planned for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This uncertainty, coupled with rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tensions, contributes to a general anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. As a result, many Canadians delay retirement not out of absolute necessity, but because they seek peace of mind and feel unsafe relying solely on a fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Unexpected events like a market dip, medical emergency, or rent increase can easily derail a retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. To mitigate these fears, individuals often work a few extra years to build a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

This growing financial pressure, alongside other factors such as [[impact_of_increased_life_expectancy_on_retirement | increased life expectancy]], declining pension coverage, and changing views on work, underscores why the average retirement age in Canada has steadily climbed, reaching 65.3 years in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

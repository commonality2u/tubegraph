Understanding and claiming tax credits and benefits can significantly increase one's bank account in Canada by [[overlooked_canadian_tax_breaks | spending less on taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. In 2024, the government refunded over $30 billion to Canadians for returns received from February to June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite this, an H&R Block survey indicates that only 18% of Canadians feel they understand the [[overlooked_canadian_tax_breaks | tax credits and benefits]] they may be entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This highlights numerous opportunities for tax refunds and deductions that could save thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

This overview focuses on lesser-known tax deductions and credits that can result in significant tax savings, potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Moving Expenses

Moving expenses are costs incurred when relocating to a new home in Canada to be closer to a new place of work or a post-secondary institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These expenses can be deducted from income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Eligibility
To be eligible, you must move at least 40 km closer to your new work or school location within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
Deductible expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>:
*   Transportation and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Travel expenses (e.g., gas, meals, accommodations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses for up to 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Costs associated with selling your old home, such as real estate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Costs of buying your new home, including legal fees and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

### Example: Emma's Moving Expenses
Emma moved 300 km for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Her expenses included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>:
*   Moving company: $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Travel expenses: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses: $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Real estate commission for selling her old home: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   Total expenses: $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>

If Emma's income for that year was $70,000, her new taxable income after deducting moving expenses would be $62,000 ($70,000 - $8,000), leading to substantial tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Work From Home Deduction

This deduction is significant for many who work remotely, potentially saving hundreds or thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Eligibility
To claim this deduction, you must have worked from home more than 50% of the time for at least four consecutive weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, and your employer must not have reimbursed all your home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. You will need to fill out form T2200S, signed by your employer, and keep all receipts and records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
You can claim a portion of expenses for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>:
*   Utilities (electricity, heating, water) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>
*   Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   Maintenance and minor repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

### Calculation
Measure your workspace and home size to determine the percentage of your home used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For instance, if your workspace is 200 sq ft and your home is 1,000 sq ft, your workspace percentage is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Multiply your total eligible expenses by this percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. If total expenses are $5,000 and your workspace is 20%, you can claim a $1,000 deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Child Care Expenses

### Eligibility
The child must be under 16 years old or have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
You can claim expenses for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>:
*   Daycare centers and nurseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Caregivers (nannies, babysitters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>
*   Boarding schools and overnight camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   Educational institutions for the portion related to child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>

### Ineligible Expenses
You cannot claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
*   Medical or hospital care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
*   Tuition for regular schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
*   Recreational activities (sports, art classes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>
*   Transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>

### Claim Limits
The maximum claim per child depends on age and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>:
*   Under 7 years of age: Up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>
*   Between 7 and 16 years: $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
*   With a disability: $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

### Example
If you have two children aged 4 and 9 in 2023, and you spent $6,000 on daycare for the 4-year-old and $4,000 on after-school care for the 9-year-old, you can claim the full $6,000 and $4,000 respectively, totaling $10,000, as both are under the maximum allowable deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Filing Taxes on Time

[[key_canadian_tax_credits_to_claim_before_april_30th | Filing your taxes on time]] is crucial to avoid penalties and ensure receipt of benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Approximately 25% of Canadians missed filing their taxes on time in 2024, leading to unnecessary interest and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Reasons to File on Time
1.  **Avoid Penalties**: Late filing can result in significant penalties and interest charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The penalty for filing late is 5% of your balance owing, plus 1% for each full month your return is late, up to a maximum of 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
2.  **Receive Benefits**: Filing on time ensures you receive important benefits and credits without delay, such as the [[unique_tax_credits_for_seniors_retirees_and_caregivers | Canada Child Benefit]] and GST/HST credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Example: John's Late Filing
John had a tax balance owing of $2,000 and filed his return 3 months late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. His late filing penalty is 5% of $2,000 ($100), plus an additional monthly penalty of $20 (1% per month) for 3 months ($60) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. His total penalty for 3 months is $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Important Deadlines
*   **Self-employed**: File by June 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> (taxes due by April 30th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Regular employees**: File and pay taxes by April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Medical Expenses

### Eligibility
Medical expenses must be incurred for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or your dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Expenses must be paid within any 12-month period ending in the tax year and not previously claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
Common eligible expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>:
*   Prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>
*   Dental Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Vision care (glasses, contact lenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   Professional services (physiotherapy, chiropractor, psychological services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   Medical devices and equipment prescribed by a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>
(It is recommended to check the CRA website for a comprehensive list) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Ineligible Expenses
Commonly mistaken ineligible expenses include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>:
*   Over-the-counter medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   Health club memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
*   Non-prescription supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

### Claim Limits
For 2024, you can only claim expenses exceeding the lesser of $2,759 or 3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Example
If you have a net income of $60,000 and incurred $3,000 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, the maximum you can claim is the lesser of 3% of $60,000 ($1,800) or $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Therefore, the maximum deduction is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## FHSA (First Home Savings Account)

The [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | FHSA]] might be the best tax deduction available for a registered account, whether you plan to buy a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It's a new registered account to help Canadians save for their first home, combining features of both RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Advantages over RRSP
Anyone who qualifies should consider investing in the FHSA before their RRSP due to its <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>:
1.  **Flexibility**: If you don't buy a home, you can transfer savings to an RRSP or RRIF without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
2.  **No Impact on RRSP Room**: Contributions to your FHSA do not affect your RRSP contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
3.  **No Repayment Required**: Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan under the RRSP, amounts withdrawn from your [[tax_advantages_for_firsttime_home_buyers_in_canada | FHSA]] for a home purchase do not need to be repaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Contributions to your FHSA are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Eligibility
To qualify, you must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>:
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>
*   Be at least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>
*   Be a first-time home buyer (meaning you haven't owned a home in the current or previous four years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>

### Example: Sarah's FHSA
Sarah, 30, plans to buy her first home in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. She opens an FHSA and contributes $8,000 annually, with a 30% marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   After 5 years, she contributed $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   With tax-free growth, her account grows to $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   She saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

**Scenario 1: Sarah buys a home**
Sarah withdraws the $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment, significantly boosting her ability to afford a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

**Scenario 2: Sarah doesn't buy a home**
In 15 years, she can transfer the amount in her FHSA to her RRSP or RRIF tax-free, where savings continue to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

The FHSA is beneficial whether a home is purchased or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The [[unique_tax_credits_for_seniors_retirees_and_caregivers | Canada Child Benefit]] is a tax-free monthly payment to eligible families to help with the cost of raising children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. It supports families who need it most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Eligibility
To be eligible for the CCB, you must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>:
*   Live with a child under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>
*   Be primarily responsible for the child's care and upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   You or your spouse/common-law partner must be a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, protected person, or a temporary resident who has lived in Canada for the previous 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

The amount received depends on your adjusted family net income and the number of children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The CRA recalculates the benefit every July based on your previous year's tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Benefits begin to be reduced if your adjusted net family income is above $34,636 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Maximum Annual Benefit
*   Per child under six: $7,437 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>
*   Per child aged 6 to 17: $6,275 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>

## Canada Caregiver Credit (CCC)

The [[unique_tax_credits_for_seniors_retirees_and_caregivers | Canada Caregiver Credit]] is a non-refundable tax credit for individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, or dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Eligibility
You must support a spouse, common-law partner, or dependent with a physical or mental impairment, and be responsible for their care and upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Eligible Dependents
Eligible dependents can include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>:
*   Your spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>
*   Your or your spouse/common-law partner's child or grandchild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>
*   A parent, grandparent, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, niece, or nephew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>

The amount of the credit depends on your relationship with the dependent and their net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The base amount for the CCC is up to $7,999 for each eligible dependent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Canada Training Credit (CTC)

The Canada Training Credit is a refundable tax credit to help Canadians cover work-related training costs, aiming to develop skills and improve employability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Eligibility
To be eligible for the CTC, you must <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>:
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
*   Be between 26 and 65 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>
*   Have earnings of at least $10,000 from employment or self-employment, but not more than $150,000 in the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>
*   Have filed a tax return for the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
*   Have a CTC limit still available, starting at $250 per year up to a lifetime limit of $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>

You can claim the lesser of your CTC limit or 50% of your eligible tuition and fees for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Example: Lisa's Training
Lisa earns $50,000 annually and takes a $1,000 course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Her CTC limit for the year is $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. She can claim the lesser of $250 or 50% of her $1,000 tuition fees ($500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Therefore, Lisa can claim $250 as a tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Tuition Tax Credit

The Tuition Tax Credit is a non-refundable tax credit that helps students reduce their income taxes by claiming eligible tuition fees for post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Eligibility
You must be enrolled at a designated educational institution in a qualifying program and have paid more than $100 in eligible tuition fees for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Eligible Expenses
Eligible expenses include tuition fees for courses taken at post-secondary institutions, as well as certain occupational skills courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Example: Sarah's Tuition
Sarah, a university student, paid $6,000 in eligible tuition fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   Federal tuition tax credit rate is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, so her federal credit is 15% of $6,000 = $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   If her province has a 10% rate, her provincial credit is 10% of $6,000 = $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   Her total tax credit is $1,500, which reduces her income tax owing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Pension Income Splitting

Pension income splitting allows you to transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your spouse or common-law partner for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This can reduce your overall family tax bill by taking advantage of a lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### Eligibility
You must receive eligible pension income (e.g., payments from a registered pension plan, RRIF, or annuity payments) and be married or in a common-law relationship at the end of the tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Eligible Income
Typically includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>:
*   Pension income from a registered Pension Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>
*   Annuity payments from an RRSP or RRIF if you were 65 or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>
*   Certain other annuity payments received by individuals 65 or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>

## Digital News Subscription Tax Credit

This tax credit helps Canadians save money on taxes when subscribing to qualified Canadian digital news services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

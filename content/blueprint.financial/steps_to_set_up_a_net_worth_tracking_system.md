Tracking your financial goals can significantly increase your likelihood of achieving them, with one study from Michigan State University suggesting it makes you 33% more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle applies directly to finances, as tracking net worth can transform how personal finances are managed and help grow wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?
[[benefits_of_tracking_your_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is comparable to tracking weight loss, where small, consistent actions lead to substantial results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania indicated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw significant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>: those tracking 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The key takeaway is that tracking correlates with goal success, even if not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The same consistency principle applies to finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can identify trends, make smarter decisions, and stay on track toward your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. [[benefits_of_tracking_your_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] acts like a compass, guiding you and preventing you from drifting off course financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Setting Up a Net Worth Tracker Using a Spreadsheet
[[using_spreadsheets_for_financial_tracking | Using spreadsheets]] can make [[benefits_of_tracking_your_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Initial setup typically takes 10 to 20 minutes, with monthly updates requiring only about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A free spreadsheet with a visual dashboard is available to help with this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This tool can be used for an individual or as a [[household_vs_individual_net_worth | whole household]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Initial Setup
1.  **Download and Copy the Spreadsheet**: Obtain the Google Sheet tracker and make a copy for your personal use, saving it to your computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
    *   Rename the file to include the current year, e.g., "2025 net worth tracker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It's recommended to start a new tracker at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
2.  **Set Start Month and Net Worth Goal**:
    *   Go to the "Inputs" section and set the start month to the beginning of your current year, even if filling it out mid-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   Enter your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | net worth goal]] (e.g., 1.5 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For guidance on setting this goal, you can refer to videos on the average net worth in Canada and the [[importance_of_reaching_the_first_100000_net_worth_milestone | significance of net worth after $100,000]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   **Pro Tip**: Set a recurring monthly reminder (e.g., for the first of each month) to fill out the tracker; it typically takes only about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Entering Financial Data
The tracker requires input for various asset and liability categories:

*   **Current Assets**:
    *   Include items like cash, GICs, savings accounts (e.g., RBC checking, Tangerine savings, CI direct savings, EQ Bank savings), PayPal, Wise prepaid Visa, and Wealthsimple Cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   A car can also be included here, but its value will need to be depreciated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
    *   If you run out of rows, you can easily add more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   *Note*: A common observation when filling this out is having many accounts, which might suggest a need to trim down to three to five accounts for easier management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Assets**:
    *   These include registered accounts (e.g., TD SP, Wealthsimple TFSA, Wealthsimple RSP, Questrade LIRA) and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   An FHSA (First Home Savings Account) is also a great new account to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Current Liabilities**:
    *   This category includes credit cards (e.g., from different banks), revolving lines of credit, and car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Liabilities**:
    *   Examples include student loans, mortgages, and home equity lines of credit (HELOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Dashboard Insights
Once the data is entered, the dashboard provides a valuable visual overview:
*   **Current Net Worth**: Displays your current net worth, total assets, total liabilities, your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | net worth goal]], and the shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Net Worth Trend**: Shows a graph of your net worth progression throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   It's important to identify dips in the trend and investigate what caused them (e.g., market dips affecting risky assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This analysis can help in [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_financial_data | making smarter financial decisions]], such as re-evaluating risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Assets vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Visualizes the proportion of your assets (current vs. long-term) and liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Detailed progress for each month, showing increases or decreases in net worth and percentage change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Annual Review and Accumulation
After filling out and analyzing the data for a year, it's recommended to create a new copy of the spreadsheet, delete the old data, and fill it in for the next year (e.g., 2026, 2027) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This allows for [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | comparing your performance year-over-year]], creating a comprehensive balance sheet of your net worth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## [[alternative_tools_for_tracking_net_worth | Alternative Tools for Tracking Net Worth]]
While the custom spreadsheet offers a free, customizable, and controlled method for [[benefits_of_tracking_your_net_worth | tracking net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, several other tools are available for Canadians, each with its own costs or limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>:

*   **Wetha**: Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Advanced features require a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Quicken (Replaced Mint)**: Mint, previously a popular free option in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While offering robust financial tracking, its cost might not be justified when free alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app that helps monitor spending and manage finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. It offers a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

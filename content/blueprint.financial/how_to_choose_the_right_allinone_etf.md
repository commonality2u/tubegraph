For example, Vanguard VGRO, a trusted [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]] in Canada with over $6 billion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, typically allocates 80% to stocks and 20% to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Its stock component includes Canadian, U.S., international, and emerging market stocks, offering access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The bond component consists of Canadian and global bonds, designed to stabilize the portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This diversification helps reduce risk and enhance returns at a low fee, often around 0.24% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Choosing the Right All-in-One ETF
When selecting an [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]], the company providing the ETF is less important than choosing the correct asset allocation for your risk tolerance and investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Matching Asset Allocation to Your Risk Tolerance
Instead of focusing on the ETF brand, consider "how much risk am I comfortable with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Higher Risk, Higher Returns**: For those comfortable with more risk, look for ETFs with 100% stocks and 0% bonds, such as VQT and XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Balanced Approach (Growth-Oriented)**: A common choice is 80% stocks and 20% bonds, found in VGRO and XGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Lower Risk, Steady Growth**: For a more conservative approach, consider 60% stocks and 40% bonds, offered by VBAL and XBAL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Conservative, Stability-Focused**: If stability is a priority, choose ETFs with 40% stocks and 60% bonds, like VCNS or XCNS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Your risk tolerance and investment goals should drive your decision, rather than solely the ETF provider, as long as fees are reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## How to Invest in All-in-One ETFs Step-by-Step
1.  **Determine Your Risk Tolerance**: Before buying, assess your comfort level with market swings, your investment time horizon, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Free tools like the Vanguard investor questionnaire can help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
2.  **Choose a Brokerage**: You'll need a brokerage account. Top options in Canada include:
    *   **Well Simple Trade**: Known for zero commission fees and great for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Questrade**: Also offers zero commission fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   **Big Bank Platforms (e.g., TD Direct Investing, RBC Direct Investing)**: Convenient if you already bank with them, but often have higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    Make sure to open the right [[selecting_the_right_investment_accounts_in_canada | account type]]—TFSA, RRSP, or non-registered—based on your investing goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
3.  **Buy the ETF**: Once your account is set up:
    *   Log into your brokerage account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Search for the ETF by its ticker (e.g., VGRO or ZBAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   Enter the number of shares you wish to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
    *   Choose a market order (immediate purchase) or a limit order (set your desired price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   Confirm your purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
4.  **Optional: Set Up DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan)**: Enable this feature in your brokerage settings to automatically reinvest any dividends to buy more shares, compounding your growth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## [[common_investment_mistakes_with_etfs | Common All-in-One ETF Mistakes to Avoid]]
Even with their simplicity, investors can make mistakes that harm returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>:
*   **Dishonest Investor Questionnaire Answers**: If you don't answer truthfully, you might end up in an ETF that doesn't match your true comfort level, leading to panic selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Getting Bored and Tweaking Too Much**: The biggest advantage of [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] is their "set it and forget it" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Constantly checking accounts and making unnecessary changes can hurt long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account**: [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | All-in-one ETFs]] are designed to be standalone investments per account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Adding more funds or combining them with other ETFs can disrupt their built-in balance and create unnecessary complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. For instance, VGRO alone offers exposure to 13,000 companies, providing ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Pick one that fits your risk tolerance and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

Investing should be like "watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. By choosing the right [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETF]] based on your risk tolerance and resisting the urge to overcomplicate, you can achieve your financial goals with minimal stress.

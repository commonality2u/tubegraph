Choosing an all-in-one ETF can seem overwhelming due to the many options available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, the key to making the right decision lies not in the brand of the ETF, but in selecting the correct asset allocation that matches your risk tolerance and investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Key Factors for Choosing

### 1. Determine Your Risk Tolerance
Before investing, it's crucial to understand how much risk you are comfortable with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This assessment helps you choose between an aggressive or a more balanced ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. A quick way to assess your risk tolerance is by using free tools like the Vanguard investor questionnaire, which asks questions about your comfort with market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Your risk tolerance will dictate the stock-to-bond ratio of your chosen all-in-one ETF:
*   **Higher Risk, Higher Returns:** Consider ETFs with 100% stocks and 0% bonds, such as Vanguard VQT and iShares XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Balanced Approach (Growth with Stability):** Look for ETFs with 80% stocks and 20% bonds, like Vanguard VGRO and iShares XGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Vanguard VGRO, for example, is one of the most trusted all-in-one ETFs in Canada, providing exposure to over 13,000 companies worldwide through 80% stock allocation (Canadian, US, International, and emerging markets) and 20% bond allocation (Canadian and global bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It has a low fee of 0.24% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Lower Risk, Steady Growth:** ETFs with 60% stocks and 40% bonds, such as Vanguard VBAL and iShares XBAL, may be suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Conservative (More Stability):** For greater stability, consider ETFs with 40% stocks and 60% bonds, like Vanguard VCNS or iShares XCNS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Your risk tolerance and investment goals should drive your decision, not solely the ETF provider, as long as the fees are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### 2. The Canadian ETF Landscape
Canada offers several major providers known for their high-quality all-in-one ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>:
*   **iShares (owned by BlackRock):** Known for XGRO, XBAL, and XEQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Vanguard:** Offers VGRO, VBAL, and VQT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **BMO:** Provides ZGRO, ZBAL, and ZEQT, offering strong diversification and the appeal of a big bank brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Horizons:** Features unique swap-based ETFs designed for tax efficiency in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

These providers typically offer low-cost, diversified, and auto-rebalancing ETFs that simplify investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. All-in-one ETFs generally charge an expense ratio between 0.2% to 0.25% MER, which is significantly lower than traditional mutual funds in Canada that often charge around 2% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing and Managing

Even though [[introduction_to_allinone_etfs_in_canada | all-in-one ETFs]] are designed for simplicity, there are common mistakes investors make:

### 1. Filling Out the Investor Questionnaire Dishonestly
It is crucial to answer questions honestly when determining your risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If you are too conservative, you might miss out on growth. If you are too aggressive, you could panic and sell at the wrong time during a market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Take this step seriously to match your actual comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### 2. Getting Bored and Tweaking Too Much
The main advantage of [[benefits_and_features_of_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] is their "set it and forget it" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Constantly checking accounts or making unnecessary changes due to market swings can hurt long-term returns; patience is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Investing should be "more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### 3. Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account
[[common_mistakes_to_avoid_with_allinone_etfs | All-in-one ETFs]] are designed to be standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Adding multiple all-in-one ETFs or combining them with other ETFs can disrupt their carefully designed balance and complicate your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For example, Vanguard VGRO alone provides exposure to over 13,000 companies, offering ample diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. It is best to choose one that fits your risk tolerance and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

If you wish to experiment beyond a single all-in-one ETF, consider using separate accounts for different strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For instance:
*   **TFSA:** Keep it simple with a single all-in-one ETF like VGRO for long-term, tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **RRSP:** Build your own stock portfolio if you want to pick individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Non-registered account:** Focus on tax-efficient ETFs, such as Horizons swap-based ETFs, to minimize taxes on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

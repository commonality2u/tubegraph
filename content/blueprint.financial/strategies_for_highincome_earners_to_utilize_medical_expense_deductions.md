Navigating medical expenses can be challenging, but the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows Canadians to claim certain costs on their taxes through the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This credit allows individuals to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For high-income earners, understanding how to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize tax deductions]] for these expenses can significantly impact their tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Understanding the Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC)

To claim the METC, medical expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return:
*   Line 33099: For expenses for yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Line 33199: For expenses for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Only the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or a set threshold amount ($2,759 for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The METC is a non-refundable credit that reduces your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Example Calculation
Consider Jessica, who earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   3% of her income: $50,000 * 0.03 = $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>
*   Eligible claim: $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% of income) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | Common Medical Expenses Eligible for Tax Deductions]]

Several common medical expenses can be claimed:

*   **Prescribed Drugs and Medications:** These must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This includes medical marijuana, provided there's a valid medical document and it's purchased from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Over-the-counter medications like vitamins and supplements generally do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Dental and Vision Care:** Services provided by licensed professionals such as dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists are eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This covers routine checkups, fillings, root canals, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening are not eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **[[guidelines_for_claiming_medical_travel_expenses_and_private_insurance_premiums | Medical Travel Expenses]]:** If you travel at least 40 km one way for medical services unavailable near your home, you can claim transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. For travel over 80 km, meals and accommodations can also be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Eligible expenses include public transportation, vehicle costs (fuel, parking, maintenance), lodging, and meals during an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If certified by a medical practitioner, travel costs for an accompanying person can also be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **[[guidelines_for_claiming_medical_travel_expenses_and_private_insurance_premiums | Private Health Insurance Premiums]]:** Premiums paid out-of-pocket for private health insurance plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization may be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless included as taxable income on a T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Self-employed individuals can claim premiums if they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Family plans may allow claiming premiums for spouses and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Medical Devices and Equipment:** Costs for items like wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces, and in some cases, home modifications (e.g., wheelchair ramps, stairlifts) are eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Some devices require a doctor's prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Ongoing maintenance costs, such as batteries for hearing aids, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Strategies for High-Income Earners

High-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim due to the 3% net income threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### 1. Timing Major Procedures
Consider timing major medical procedures within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. For example, scheduling laser eye surgery and a root canal in the same year could help meet the deduction threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### 2. [[maximizing_medical_expense_claims_for_families | Maximizing Family Medical Expense Claims]]
For families, properly [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_Canadian_tax_returns | claiming medical expenses]] can make a significant difference. The CRA allows combining medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

*   **Identify the Lowest Earner:** It is generally advantageous for the person in the family with the lowest net income to claim the combined medical expenses, as this can result in a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This strategy is part of [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | income splitting strategies to reduce taxes]] and [[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | income splitting strategies for tax savings]].

#### Family Example
Richard and Pauline, with two children (Jen, 16; Rob, 19), incurred the following medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
*   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
*   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   Jen (under 18): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
*   Rob (over 18): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
Total expenses: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses ($1,800) are combined with Richard and Pauline's, totaling $6,300, which is claimed on line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

**Calculation for Pauline (Income: $55,000):**
*   3% of income: $55,000 * 0.03 = $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>
*   Eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>

**Calculation for Richard (Income: $42,000):**
*   3% of income: $42,000 * 0.03 = $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>
*   Eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

Since Richard's eligible claim ($5,040) is higher, he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Record Keeping
Maintaining detailed records, including receipts and prescriptions, is crucial for [[medical_expenses_deduction_in_canada | maximizing your claim]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. For medical devices, ensure they are on the CRA's list of eligible devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

Deciding when to start your [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] (Canada Pension Plan) and [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] (Old Age Security) benefits can significantly impact your retirement income and tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Estimating your income and expenses between ages 60 and 69 can help you find the most tax-efficient timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## How Delaying Benefits Impacts Income and Taxes

[[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | Delaying CPP and OAS]] until age 70 increases your monthly payment significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] grows by 8.4% per year after age 65, and [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] by 7.2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. This higher income is often worth the wait, especially if you have other sources of income to cover early expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

### Example of Delaying Benefits

Consider John, who could start [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] and [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] at 65, receiving $1,500 per month, or $18,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. However, because he plans to work part-time and sell property between ages 65 and 69, adding [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] and [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] would push him into a higher marginal tax bracket and subject him to the [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] clawback (a 15% recovery tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Instead, John chooses to delay his benefits until 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. By doing so, his [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] and [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] income increases to $2,125 per month, or $25,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. By [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP and OAS]], John not only gains an extra $7,500 annually but also keeps his tax bill lower during those early retirement years (ages 65-69) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This approach offers both higher guaranteed income and significant tax savings through a lower marginal tax rate and avoiding [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

## When Starting Early May Be Better

[[Delaying CPP and Timing Benefits | Delaying benefits]] isn't always the best strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Consider starting [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] or [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] sooner if:
*   **Health Concerns** You have a shorter life expectancy, making early benefits more practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Immediate Income Needs** Other income sources are limited, and starting [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] at 60 or 65 provides needed stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### Tax Implications of CPP and OAS Payments

It's important to note that the pension income amount credit, which allows retirees to claim up to $2,000 of eligible pension income tax-free, does not apply to your [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] or [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This credit must be applied to other pension income, such as from a RIF (Registered Income Fund) or a private pension plan, to be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Similarly, it cannot be claimed on line 31400 of your tax return for [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | CPP]] or [[CPP and OAS benefits in Canada | OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

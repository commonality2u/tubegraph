Deciding when to start your [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and [[timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits can significantly impact your retirement income and overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. By estimating your income and expenses between ages 60 and 69, you can identify the most tax-efficient timing for these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## How Delaying Benefits Impacts Income and Taxes

Delaying [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | CPP]] and [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | OAS]] until age 70 can substantially increase your monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Specifically, [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | CPP]] grows by 8.4% per year after age 65, and [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | OAS]] grows by 7.2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This higher income is often beneficial, especially if you have other income sources to cover your expenses in the early retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Example: John's Delay Strategy

Consider John, who could start [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | CPP]] and [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | OAS]] at 65, receiving $1,500 per month or $18,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, since he plans to work part-time and sell property between ages 65 and 69, starting these benefits early would:
*   Push him into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   Subject him to the [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]], a 15% recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

Instead, John chooses to delay his benefits until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. By doing so, his [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | CPP]] and [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | OAS]] increase to a combined $2,125 per month, or $25,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This delay not only provides John with an extra $7,500 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> but also keeps his tax bill lower during the early retirement years (65-69) by maintaining a lower marginal tax rate and avoiding the [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## When Starting Early May Be Better

While delaying benefits often yields significant advantages, it's not always the best strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Consider starting [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | CPP]] or [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | OAS]] sooner if:
*   **Health Concerns** If you have a shorter life expectancy, taking early benefits may be more practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Immediate Income Needs** If other income sources are limited, starting [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | CPP]] at 60 or 65 can provide essential financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

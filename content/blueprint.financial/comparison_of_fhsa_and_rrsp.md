The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is Canada's new account, often preferred over the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) for certain financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the FHSA is generally more advantageous, there are specific situations where the [[pros_and_cons_of_rrsps | RRSP]] still comes out on top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Saving for a Home: FHSA vs. RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

### FHSA for Home Savings
The FHSA allows contributions of up to $8,000 per year, with a maximum lifetime contribution of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When buying a home, the full amount can be withdrawn tax-free, and crucially, no repayment is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This provides greater financial freedom and reduces stress during early home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For example, if Paul contributed $40,000 over 5 years, he could withdraw it entirely tax-free for his home purchase, with no obligation to repay it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
In contrast, the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) allows withdrawals of up to $60,000 tax-free for a home purchase (recently increased from $35,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, this amount must be repaid over 15 years, starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Missing a repayment adds the missed amount to your taxable income for the year, increasing your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

> [!WINNER] FHSA
> The FHSA is the clear winner for saving for a home due to its tax-free withdrawals and no repayment obligations, offering peace of mind for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Down Payment Potential

### FHSA Down Payment Growth
With an FHSA, if Paul contributes $8,000 annually for 5 years ($40,000 total) and achieves a 6% annual return, his account could grow to approximately $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. If he leaves the money invested for an additional 10 years, his FHSA could reach about $80,000, providing a significantly larger tax-free down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### RRSP HBP Down Payment Limit
The RRSP HBP allows a maximum withdrawal of $60,000 tax-free for a down payment, which is a fixed limit, and it requires repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

> [!WINNER] FHSA
> The FHSA offers more flexibility and the potential for a larger tax-free down payment, especially if the funds are not needed immediately for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## [[Tax benefits of FHSA vs RRSP | Tax Benefits]]

### FHSA Tax Advantages
The FHSA provides a "double tax advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Contributions are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an upfront tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The significant benefit arises at withdrawal: when used for a first home, the funds are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For instance, contributing $8,000 to an FHSA might save around $2,000 in taxes, and if the account grows to $10,000 and is withdrawn for a home, the entire $10,000 is tax-free with no repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### RRSP Tax Advantages
RRSP contributions are also tax-deductible, offering upfront savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. While the HBP allows tax-free withdrawals up to $60,000, the critical difference is the mandatory repayment over 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Missed repayments are added to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Essentially, the HBP acts more like a tax-free loan from your RRSP, which eventually is taxed when fully withdrawn in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

> [!WINNER] FHSA
> The FHSA is superior for tax benefits, providing upfront tax savings, tax-free withdrawals, and the flexibility of no repayment, making it a simpler and more efficient option for home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## [[Investment potential of FHSA and RRSP | Investment Potential]]

Both the FHSA and RRSP offer excellent investment opportunities, allowing investments in a wide range of options like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. A key shared benefit is tax-deferred growth, meaning taxes are not paid on gains as investments grow, allowing for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Although labeled a "savings account," the FHSA functions as both a savings and investment account, enabling strategic investments just like an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

> [!WINNER] TIE
> Since both accounts offer the same powerful [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | investment potential]] and tax-deferred growth, there is no clear winner here. The main difference lies in how funds are withdrawn, not how they are invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## [[Retirement savings FHSA vs RRSP | Retirement Savings]]

### FHSA as a Retirement Bridge
While the RRSP is traditionally seen as the primary [[retirement_savings_fhsa_vs_rrsp | retirement savings]] vehicle due to its focus and higher contribution limits, the FHSA offers a flexible and powerful alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. You can contribute up to $40,000 to an FHSA and have up to 15 years to use the funds for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Critically, if you decide not to buy a home within that 15-year period, the balance can be transferred into your RRSP without losing any tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This means the FHSA can act as a bridge to the RRSP, offering the same growth potential with added flexibility for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### RRSP for Retirement Savings
The RRSP allows for higher contributions, up to 18% of your income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, starting with the FHSA provides more flexibility: you can leverage tax-free withdrawals for a house, and if plans change, easily transfer funds to the RRSP without penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

> [!WINNER] FHSA
> The FHSA provides tax-free withdrawals for a home and the flexibility to roll into an RRSP, making it an ideal starting point for both first-time home buyers and long-term retirement planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## When the RRSP is the Smarter Choice

Despite the FHSA's advantages, there are two key situations where the RRSP is the smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>:

### 1. Investing in US Stocks
When investing in US stocks, any dividends earned in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can significantly reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. With an RRSP, thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, this tax is avoided entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Invest in US stocks through your RRSP, not your FHSA, to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 2. Employer Matching Contributions
If your employer offers to match your RRSP contributions, this is essentially free money that boosts your [[retirement_savings_fhsa_vs_rrsp | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if an employer matches up to $5,000 per year, contributing $5,000 to your RRSP would result in an additional $5,000 from the employer, totaling $10,000 in your RRSP for that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The FHSA currently does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

> [!WINNER] RRSP (in specific cases)
> When it comes to avoiding US dividend taxes and taking advantage of employer matching benefits, the RRSP takes the lead for long-term investors and those with strong work benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

Overall, the FHSA typically wins over the RRSP in most categories, including flexibility, saving for a home, and [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | tax advantages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The only times it makes more sense to prioritize an RRSP are if you are heavily investing in US dividend stocks or receiving employer matching RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Mastering your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)]] and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is crucial for managing taxable income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Think of your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] as a lever to strategically control your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. By using these accounts together, you can manage your tax bracket, reduce overall taxes, and keep government benefits intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Key Strategies for TFSA and RRSP Coordination

### 1. Supplement RRSP Income with TFSA Withdrawals

[[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | RRSP]] withdrawals are fully taxable and can quickly push you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. By pairing [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | RRSP]] withdrawals with tax-free [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] withdrawals, you can meet your income needs without incurring a higher marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This approach is particularly useful if you are also receiving taxable Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

**Example:**
John, at age 68, receives $20,000 annually from CPP and OAS but needs an additional $30,000 for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Instead of withdrawing the entire $30,000 from his [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | RRSP]] (which would increase his taxable income), John withdraws $10,000 from his [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | RRSP]] and $20,000 from his [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This strategy helps John keep his taxable income low, stay within his desired tax bracket, and reduce his overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### 2. Shift Excess RRSP Funds to Your TFSA

When you don't need all your [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | RRSP]] withdrawals for living expenses, transferring excess funds to your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] is a smart move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This has a dual benefit: it helps avoid large Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) minimum withdrawals in the future that could push you into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Funds in your [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] also benefit from tax-free growth and offer the flexibility to withdraw at any time without additional tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

**Example:**
Sarah, at age 65, withdraws $40,000 from her [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | RRSP]] to cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. She decides to pull an extra $20,000 to contribute to her [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This move ensures her future RRIF minimums remain smaller and allows her to grow funds tax-free in her [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_all_withdrawal_strategies | TFSA]] for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### 3. Preserve Government Benefits

[[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | TFSA withdrawals do not count as taxable income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This makes them ideal for covering extra expenses without risking [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | OAS or GIS clawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This strategy allows you to control your taxable income levels and keep government benefits intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

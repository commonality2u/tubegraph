As the year-end approaches, reviewing your medical expenses and charitable donations can significantly reduce your tax bill through available tax credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Medical Expenses

In [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | Canada]], you can claim a [[claimable_medical_expenses_for_taxes | medical expense tax credit]] for eligible costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The claimable amount is for expenses exceeding the lesser of 3% of your net income or $2,759 for the 2024 tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. In essence, the more expenses you incur, the greater your potential savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Calculating Your Claim

To understand [[calculating_eligible_medical_expense_claims | how to calculate your eligible claim]], consider this example:
*   If your net income is $50,000, 3% of that is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   Since $1,500 is less than the $2,759 threshold, you can only claim expenses that exceed $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Therefore, if you spent $4,000 on eligible medical expenses, you can claim the difference: $4,000 minus $1,500, resulting in a $2,500 claim on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Eligible Medical Expenses

Common [[claimable_medical_expenses_for_taxes | eligible expenses]] include:
*   Prescription medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
*   Dental work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   Vision care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>
*   Mobility aids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>

### Pro Tip for Maximizing Your Claim

If you are close to the medical expense threshold, consider scheduling additional treatments or purchasing necessary medical items before December 31st to maximize your claim for the current tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. For example, getting dental work done or buying medical equipment now could increase your claimable expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Charitable Donations

Donating to registered charities by December 31st can reduce your tax bill through the charitable donation tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Tax Credit Breakdown

*   **Federal Credit:** 15% on the first $200 donated and 29% on amounts over $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Provincial Credits:** These vary by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For example, Alberta offers a high 60% donation tax credit on the first $200 donated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
    *   If you donate $100 in Alberta, you would receive the 15% federal tax credit plus the 60% provincial tax credit, totaling a $75 tax credit on that $100 donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Key Tips for Charitable Donations

*   **Donation Limit:** You can claim donations up to 75% of your net income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Carry Forward:** Unused donations can be carried forward for up to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Pooling:** Spouses or common-law partners can combine their donations to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

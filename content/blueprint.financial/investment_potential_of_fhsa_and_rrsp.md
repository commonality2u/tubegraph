Both the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) offer excellent investment opportunities in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. They allow for a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Tax-Deferred Growth
A key benefit of both accounts is that they offer tax-deferred growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This means you won't pay taxes on the gains while your investments grow, allowing for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## FHSA as an Investment Account
While the FHSA is often labeled a "savings account," it functions as both a savings and an investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. You can make strategic investments within an FHSA that have the potential to grow significantly, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Comparison of Investment Potential
Given that both the FHSA and RRSP offer the same investment potential and allow for tax-deferred growth, there is no clear winner when it comes to the investment capabilities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. You can use either account to build a well-diversified investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The main difference between the two accounts lies in how you withdraw the funds, not how you invest in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Situations Favoring RRSP for Investments
Despite the general tie in investment potential, there are two specific situations where the [[situations_favoring_rrsp_over_fhsa | RRSP]] is the smarter choice for investing:

### Investing in US Stocks
If you are investing in US Stocks, any dividends earned in an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This tax can significantly reduce your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. However, with an RRSP, thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, you can avoid this tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Therefore, it is recommended to invest in US Stocks through your RRSP to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Employer Matching Contributions
Another significant advantage of the RRSP is employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. If your employer offers to match your RRSP contributions, this is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For example, if an employer matches up to $5,000 per year, contributing $5,000 to an RRSP would result in an additional $5,000 from the employer, totaling $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The FHSA currently does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. If you have access to this benefit at work, the RRSP is the clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

For long-term investors and those with strong work benefits, the [[situations_favoring_rrsp_over_fhsa | RRSP]] takes the lead in these specific investment scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

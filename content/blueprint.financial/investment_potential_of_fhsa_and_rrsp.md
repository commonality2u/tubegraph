The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) both offer robust opportunities for investment growth.

## Investment Potential: FHSA vs. RRSP

Both the FHSA and the RRSP provide excellent platforms for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:29">[04:25:29]</a>. They allow for a wide range of investment options, including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:32">[04:30:32]</a>. A significant advantage of both accounts is their tax-deferred growth, meaning you do not pay taxes on gains while your investments grow, which allows for compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:40">[04:41:40]</a>.

While the FHSA is labelled a "savings account," it functions as both a savings and an investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>. This means you can make strategic investments within it that have the potential for significant growth, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:05">[04:58:05]</a>.

> When comparing the general [[investment_options_for_a_tfsa | investment potential]], there is no clear winner between the FHSA and RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:21">[05:09:21]</a>. Both accounts enable tax-deferred growth and offer the same powerful investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:44">[05:21:44]</a>. The primary distinction between the two lies in how funds are withdrawn, not how they are invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:08">[05:27:08]</a>.

## Situations Where RRSP Excels for Investments

Despite the general tie in investment potential, there are specific scenarios where prioritizing the RRSP for investments is a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a>:

### Investing in US Stocks
If you plan to invest heavily in US Stocks, the RRSP offers a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:07">[07:31:07]</a>. Dividends earned on US stocks within an FHSA are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can substantially reduce your returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:14">[07:33:14]</a>. However, thanks to the US-Canada tax treaty, this withholding tax is avoided when investing in US stocks through an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:04">[07:42:04]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip
> Invest in US Stocks through your RRSP, not your FHSA, to bypass the 15% withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:49">[07:47:49]</a>.

### Employer Matching Contributions
Another key advantage of the RRSP is the availability of employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:56">[07:56:56]</a>. If your employer offers to match your RRSP contributions, this is essentially free money that boosts your retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:27">[08:00:27]</a>. For example, if an employer matches $5,000 of your RRSP contributions, your account gains an immediate $5,000, totaling $10,000 for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:40">[08:23:40]</a>. Therefore, if you have access to this benefit, the RRSP is the clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:17">[08:27:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Winner: RRSP
> For [[the_importance_of_having_a_clear_rrsp_investment_strategy | long-term investors]] or those with strong work benefits, the RRSP takes the lead when it comes to avoiding US dividend taxes and leveraging employer matching benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:41">[08:33:41]</a>.

Overall, while the FHSA generally wins in most categories like flexibility, saving for a home, or [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_vs_rrsp | tax advantages]], the RRSP should be prioritized if you are heavily investing in US dividend stocks or receiving employer matching RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:03">[09:01:03]</a>.

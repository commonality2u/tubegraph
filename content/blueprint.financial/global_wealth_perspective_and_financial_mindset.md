A single person earning $30,000 in Canada is considered to be in the high-income group worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:31">[05:33:31]</a>.

Many people globally live on just a few dollars a day and have limited access to essentials like clean water and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:03">[05:52:03]</a>.

Experiencing extreme poverty firsthand, such as through travel, can foster gratitude for one's current financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:16">[05:57:16]</a>.

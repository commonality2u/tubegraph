Tracking goals can increase the likelihood of achieving them by 33%, as indicated by a study at Michigan State University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle applies directly to personal finances. The transformation observed since beginning to [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | track net worth]] in 2019 highlights its power in managing finances and growing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Power of Consistent Tracking

[[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | Tracking your net worth]] is comparable to tracking weight loss: small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw considerable improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Those who tracked 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This emphasizes that tracking is correlated with success towards goals, even if not perfectly executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The same principle holds true for finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Key Benefits of Tracking Net Worth

Like weight loss, consistency is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Identify Issues and Red Flags**: A net worth tracker allows users to identify significant dips or unusual variations in assets, such as a large drop in an RSP or LIRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. These "red flags" prompt a closer look into what happened during those periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance**: Discovering substantial drops in investment accounts might necessitate re-evaluating one's risk tolerance, especially if such market fluctuations prove difficult to endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Understand Asset vs. Liabilities Breakdown**: Visual trends show the proportion of assets versus liabilities, helping to understand where wealth is held and debt is owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Assess Progress Over Time**: The tracker displays monthly progress, showing increases or decreases in net worth and identifying periods of significant change, like a $10,000 drop due to a market dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Annual Comparison**: Creating a new spreadsheet copy each year allows for historical comparison, enabling individuals to [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | look back and see how they performed compared to previous years]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This accumulation of a "balance sheet" of net worth over the years provides valuable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

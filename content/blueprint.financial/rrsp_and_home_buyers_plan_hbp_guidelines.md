The Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), a long-time favorite for retirement savings in Canada, can also be leveraged for first-time home purchases through the Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. When strategically combined with the First Home Savings Account (FHSA), the RRSP and HBP can significantly boost a down payment, potentially reaching $200,000 or more, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) Basics

An RRSP allows individuals to contribute up to 18% of their income annually, with a maximum contribution of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Contributions to an RRSP are tax-deductible, providing a tax break each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## The Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

The HBP is a program that allows first-time home buyers to withdraw funds from their RRSPs tax-free to use towards a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Withdrawal Limits

*   **Individual:** An individual can withdraw up to $60,000 from their RRSP tax-free for a first home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Couples:** If buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, the combined withdrawal limit doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Repayment Requirements

Unlike the [[comparing_fhsa_and_rrsp_for_home_savings|FHSA]], funds withdrawn through the HBP must be repaid to the RRSP over a 15-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. The repayment period begins five years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

*   **Consequences of Missed Repayments:** If a repayment is missed, that amount is added to the individual's taxable income for the year, which increases their tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Combining RRSP (HBP) with FHSA for Home Savings

[[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_to_save_for_a_home|Combining FHSA and RRSP to save for a home]] can significantly increase the total down payment available.

### Example: Ross and Rachel

Consider Ross and Rachel, a couple saving for their first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

*   They each max out their FHSAs, contributing $40,000 each for a total of $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   They also utilize their RRSPs through the HBP, withdrawing $60,000 each for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   By combining both accounts, Ross and Rachel secure $200,000 for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

> [!info] Individual Savings Potential
> Even without a partner, an individual can use this strategy to save up to $100,000 towards a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

### Long-Term Growth Potential

If Ross and Rachel leave their combined $80,000 FHSA contributions for 10 years after reaching the limit (assuming 6% annual return), it could grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. When combined with $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals, they could have a massive $280,000 available for their down payment, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## Tax Advantages for Down Payments

Using tax-advantaged accounts like the FHSA and RRSP makes a significant difference in the total amount needed to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

*   **Without Tax Benefits:** To save $200,000 without tax-free accounts, an individual with a 30% tax rate would need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 left after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. This means saving an additional $85,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
*   **With FHSA and RRSP:** Contributions to these accounts are tax-deductible, meaning income isn't taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This allows individuals to save the full $200,000 without paying taxes on that specific income, drastically cutting down the overall amount needed to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

Many Canadians are receiving less than the maximum payout from their [[Canada Pension Plan CPP performance and growth | Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP), with the average recipient getting 40% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding the impact of your contributions and earnings history is crucial for optimizing your CPP benefits.

## How Contributions Affect Your CPP Payout

Your CPP retirement pension benefits are heavily dependent on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute to the plan based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To receive the maximum CPP benefit, you generally need to:
*   Contribute for at least 39 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The more you contribute and the longer your contribution period, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## The Role of Average Earnings

Your average earnings over your career directly affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your *best 40 years of earnings* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This means that higher average earnings throughout your career lead to higher CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If your annual earnings consistently meet or exceed the YMPE, your CPP benefits will be maximized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Impact of Gaps in Earnings

Be mindful of [[contribution_gaps_and_their_impact_on_cpp | gaps in earnings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Real-Life Example: David vs. Sarah

Consider David and Sarah, both 65 years old and receiving CPP, but with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:

*   **Sarah:**
    *   Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
    *   Consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   Received the maximum payout of $1,364.60 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

*   **David:**
    *   Had gaps in his employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Received only the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

This example illustrates that consistent contributions and higher earnings are key to maximizing your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize Your CPP Payments

To move from average to maximum CPP payments, focus on these strategies:

### 1. Max Out Your Earnings and Contributions
Try to ensure your annual income meets or exceeds the YMPE ($68,500 for 2024, which will increase over time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher contributions directly translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

*   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher-Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and higher-paying positions throughout your career, as more earnings mean higher CPP contributions and future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### 2. Longevity of Contributions
Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistently high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Since CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, a longer contribution period with high earnings will result in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### 3. Dropping Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions that can help exclude periods of low or no earnings, leading to a higher average earnings calculation:
*   **General Dropout Provision:** You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals around 8 years if you've contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Dropout:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years from your CPP calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions:** Periods of disability can also lead to adjustments that boost your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### 4. Work While Receiving CPP (Post-Retirement Benefit)
If you continue working and contributing to CPP up to age 70 while receiving benefits, these additional contributions will earn you a Post-Retirement Benefit, increasing your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Estimating Your CPP Benefits

There are several methods to [[estimating_your_cpp_benefits | estimate your CPP benefits]] for retirement:

### 1. Rule of Thumb
The CPP has been enhanced to replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Previously, it aimed to replace 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This method is a ballpark way to gauge your potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### 2. Using Online Calculators
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** This comprehensive tool provides a detailed estimate of your future CPP payments, though it can take about 30 minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier option, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Your Statement of Contributions
This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

*   **Online:** Access it via your My Service Canada account. Log in, select "CPP OAS," and navigate to the contribution section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **By Phone:** You can call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

While delaying your CPP start age significantly increases your payout, it doesn't directly boost you from the average to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The factors discussed above, such as contributions and earnings history, are what drive the difference between average and maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

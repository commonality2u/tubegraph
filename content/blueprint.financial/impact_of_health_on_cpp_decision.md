One significant factor to consider when deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is your health and anticipated [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. If you are in excellent health as you approach retirement, delaying your CPP benefits past age 60 could be a beneficial choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Why Good Health Favors Delaying CPP

*   **Increased [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp | Monthly Payouts]]**: Delaying CPP means you will receive significantly higher monthly benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For instance, starting CPP at age 60 results in a 36% reduction compared to starting at age 65, while delaying to age 70 offers a 42% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means a $1,000 baseline at age 65 becomes $640 at age 60, but $1,420 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. If you are in good health, you are more likely to live longer and benefit from these increased payments for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

*   **Longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | Life Expectancy]]**: Current [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_benefits | life expectancy]] rates in Canada are higher than many people realize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A 60-year-old in Canada today is expected to live to approximately 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. By delaying CPP, you are hedging against the risk of outliving your other retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

    > If you start CPP at 60, you lock in a lower monthly amount for life. If you live longer than average, the reduced income might not be sufficient for your needs as you get older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

*   **Break-even Point**: Calculations suggest that by delaying CPP from age 65 to 70, you would start earning more overall from CPP around age 81 or 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Therefore, if you anticipate living past this age, especially into your 90s, [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | delaying CPP]] can be an excellent choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Considerations for Individuals in Good Health

Delaying CPP can significantly enhance financial stability and provide a higher guaranteed income stream, leading to a more secure retirement in your 70s and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, the decision ultimately depends on individual circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. If you need the money at age 60, then starting CPP at that age is a valid decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. If not, it may be beneficial to hold off for as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Ultimately, individuals must evaluate the decision of when to take CPP based on their [[factors_affecting_cpp_timing_decision | unique situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

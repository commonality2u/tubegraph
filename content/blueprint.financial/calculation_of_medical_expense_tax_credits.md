In Canada, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) permits individuals to [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | claim certain medical expenses]] on their tax returns to help offset out-of-pocket healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) allows Canadians to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## [[claiming_medical_expenses_on_canadian_tax_returns | How Medical Expense Claims Work]]

To claim the METC, medical expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:999">[00:41:999]</a>:
*   **Line 33099**: For expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:000">[00:51:000]</a>.
*   **Line 33199**: For expenses for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:000">[00:57:000]</a>.

### Calculation Threshold

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:000">[01:07:000]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or a set threshold amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:000">[01:09:000]</a>. For 2024 expenses, this threshold is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:000">[01:17:000]</a>.

#### Example: Jessica's Claim

> [!example]
> Jessica earns $50,000 annually and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:000">[01:21:000]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($50,000) is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:000">[01:29:000]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (3% threshold) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:000">[01:32:000]</a>.
> Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit, reducing her taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:000">[01:38:000]</a>.

## Common Medical Expenses You Can Claim

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

[[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | Eligible prescription drugs and medications]] can be claimed as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:000">[01:59:000]</a>. These must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:000">[02:04:000]</a>. Medical marijuana is also covered under specific conditions: a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and purchase from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:000">[02:13:000]</a>. Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:000">[02:10:000]</a>.

#### Example: Sarah's Medication Claim

> [!example]
> Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:000">[02:22:000]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($60,000) is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:000">[02:28:000]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $3,000 (total expenses) - $1,800 (3% threshold) = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:000">[02:34:000]</a>.
> Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:000">[02:39:000]</a>.

> > [!pro tip]
> > Keep track of all pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:000">[02:43:000]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Many dental and vision care costs are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:000">[02:50:000]</a>. [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | Eligible expenses]] include services from licensed dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:000">[02:55:000]</a>. Covered services include routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:000">[03:02:000]</a>. Purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:000">[03:10:000]</a>.

#### Example: Alex's Dental and Vision Claim

> [!example]
> Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:000">[03:17:000]</a>.
> *   3% of his income ($150,000) is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:000">[03:35:000]</a>.
> *   The set threshold for 2024 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:000">[03:43:000]</a>.
> *   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 from his total medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:000">[03:45:000]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,100 - $2,759 = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:000">[03:52:000]</a>.
> Alex can claim $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:000">[03:52:000]</a>.
>
> > [!pro tip]
> > Higher-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:000">[03:59:000]</a>. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period to maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:000">[04:05:000]</a>.

### [[medical_travel_expenses_and_tax_deductions | Medical Travel Expenses]]

If you travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:000">[04:30:000]</a>. This applies if you travel at least 40 km one way for medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:000">[04:34:000]</a>. If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:000">[04:41:000]</a>.

[[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | Eligible travel expenses]] include:

> *   3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:000">[05:22:000]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,300 (total expenses) - $1,650 (3% threshold) = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:000">[05:27:000]</a>.
> Jennifer can claim $650 of expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:000">[05:33:000]</a>.

> > [!pro tip]
> > If a medical practitioner certifies you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:000">[05:36:000]</a>. Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:000">[05:43:000]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums

If you pay out-of-pocket for private health insurance, you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:000">[05:51:000]</a>. This includes plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:000">[05:55:000]</a>. Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:000">[06:01:000]</a>. Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed if they cover [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible expenses]] and are not reimbursed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:000">[06:08:000]</a>.

#### Example: Mark's Private Health Insurance Claim

> [!example]
> Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:000">[06:22:000]</a>.
> *   3% of his income ($90,000) is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:000">[06:28:000]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,500 (total premiums) - $2,700 (3% threshold) = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:000">[06:31:000]</a>.
> Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:000">[06:35:000]</a>.
>
> > [!pro tip]
> > If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, verify which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:000">[06:38:000]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Many medical devices and equipment qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:000">[06:46:000]</a>. This includes items like wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces, and in some cases, home modifications such as wheelchair ramps or stairlifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:000">[06:52:000]</a>. Some devices require a doctor's prescription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:000">[07:06:000]</a>, so keep records of both the prescription and receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:000">[07:09:000]</a>. Ongoing maintenance costs, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:000">[07:13:000]</a>.

#### Example: Emily's Medical Device Claim

> [!example]
> Emily earns $65,000 and purchased a CPAP machine for $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:000">[07:21:000]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($65,000) is $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:000">[07:28:000]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 (total expense) - $1,950 (3% threshold) = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:000">[07:34:000]</a>.
> Emily can claim $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:000">[07:39:000]</a>.
>
> > [!pro tip]
> > If making a large purchase for medical reasons, confirm it's on the CRA's list of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | eligible medical devices]] to ensure it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:000">[07:48:000]</a>.

## [[maximizing_medical_expense_claims_for_families | Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs]]

When you have a family, properly claiming medical expenses can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:000">[07:58:000]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:000">[08:02:000]</a>. Knowing which family member should claim them can maximize savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:000">[08:07:000]</a>.

### Example: Richard and Pauline's Family Claim

> [!example]
> Richard and Pauline are a couple with a 16-year-old daughter, Jen, and a 19-year-old son, Rob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:000">[08:11:000]</a>. Their medical expenses are:
> *   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:000">[08:29:000]</a>
> *   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:000">[08:31:000]</a>
> *   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:000">[08:33:000]</a>
> *   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:000">[08:34:000]</a>
> *   **Total**: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:000">[08:37:000]</a>
>
> Jen's expenses are combined with Richard's and Pauline's on line 33099, making $6,300 eligible for this line (Richard $2500 + Pauline $2000 + Jen $1800) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:000">[08:40:000]</a>. Rob's expenses must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:000">[08:49:000]</a>.
>
> Now, let's determine who should claim the $6,300 on line 33099:
> *   **Pauline's Income**: $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:000">[08:53:000]</a>
>     *   3% of Pauline's income: $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:000">[08:55:000]</a>
>     *   Pauline's eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:000">[08:59:000]</a>
> *   **Richard's Income**: $42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:000">[09:05:000]</a>
>     *   3% of Richard's income: $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:000">[09:08:000]</a>
>     *   Richard's eligible claim: $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:000">[09:12:000]</a>
>
> Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:000">[09:16:000]</a>.
>
> > [!pro tip]
> > Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction due to the 3% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:000">[09:21:000]</a>. Organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim can [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximize tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:000">[09:26:000]</a>.

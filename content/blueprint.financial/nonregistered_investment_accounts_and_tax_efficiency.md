Non-registered accounts serve as the final destination for investments after maximizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts like the FHSA, TFSA, and RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. While these accounts lack the inherent tax advantages of their registered counterparts, it is still possible to grow wealth wisely within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

## Asset Allocation for Tax Efficiency

To minimize taxes in non-registered accounts, strategic asset selection is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. This approach is part of [[asset_location_and_tax_efficiency|asset location and tax efficiency]] strategies.

### Assets to Prioritize

*   **Growth Stocks with No Dividends:** Avoid interest income, which is taxed at the highest possible rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Instead, focus on growth stocks that do not pay dividends, such as Shopify, Nvidia, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Capital gains from these stocks are taxed at a lower rate and only when the assets are sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Due diligence is recommended before investing in higher-risk growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.
*   **Canadian Dividend Stocks:** Take advantage of the Canadian dividend tax credit to lower taxes on eligible dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. For example, a $1,000 dividend is "grossed up" to $1,380 for tax purposes, resulting in a 15% federal tax credit that reduces taxes by $27 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Provincial credits can further reduce tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

### Assets to Avoid

*   **US Dividend-Paying Stocks:** Avoid US dividend-paying stocks in non-registered accounts, as they are subject to withholding taxes and do not qualify for the Canadian dividend tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

## Overall Investment Account Priority

Non-registered accounts are the final step in a comprehensive investment strategy, following the maximization of various tax-advantaged accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. The recommended order of priority for [[choosing_the_right_investment_accounts|choosing the right investment accounts]], assuming eligibility, is:

1.  **RDSP:** Offers the most generous government grants for disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
2.  **RRSP with Employer Matching:** Prioritize to take advantage of free employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
3.  **RESP:** Provides a 20% government match (Canada Education Savings Grant) up to $500 per year for education savings, and acts as a form of income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
4.  **FHSA:** Best for first-time home buyers, offering tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
5.  **RRSP or TFSA:**
    *   **RRSP:** Ideal for higher income earners due to immediate tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
    *   **TFSA:** Offers flexibility and tax-free growth for both short-term and long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
6.  **Non-Registered Accounts:** Focus on growth stocks or Canadian dividend stocks for [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies|tax efficiency]], while avoiding US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

This hierarchy ensures that investors maximize the benefits of [[types_of_investment_accounts_in_Canada|tax-advantaged accounts]] first, before moving to non-registered options, aligning with principles of [[investment_strategies_and_account_optimization|investment strategies and account optimization]]. The right account choice ultimately depends on individual financial goals, income, and savings needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

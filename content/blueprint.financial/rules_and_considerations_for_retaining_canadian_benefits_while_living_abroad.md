Many Canadians are choosing to [[reasons_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retire abroad]] to escape high costs and taxes, and to stretch their retirement savings further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While living abroad can offer significant financial advantages, it's crucial to understand the rules for retaining Canadian government benefits like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_when_living_overseas | Old Age Security (OAS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS)

The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For many, these benefits, along with personal savings, are vital for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Key Rules for OAS When Living Overseas

One critical rule to be aware of is how moving abroad can affect your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_when_living_overseas | Old Age Security (OAS)]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. You could lose your OAS if you retire abroad without meeting a specific residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Applying while in Canada**: If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you only need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Living outside Canada**: If you are living outside of Canada, you need 20 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to continue receiving OAS payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

*   **Exception: Social Security Agreements**: This 20-year rule does not apply if you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

> [!example] David's OAS experience in Thailand
> David, age 67, had 15 years of Canadian residency and began collecting OAS in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. After moving to Thailand, his OAS payments stopped after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This happened because Thailand does not have a social security agreement with Canada, and David did not meet the 20-year residency mark required for long-term payments while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

It is crucial to understand these rules before moving abroad to avoid losing income you have earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Tax Implications and Strategies

[[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | Tax implications for Canadian retirees abroad]] vary significantly by country. For instance, Paraguay operates on a territorial tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This means foreign income, such as CPP, OAS, Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), or pensions, is not taxed at all in Paraguay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Financial Planning for Retirement Abroad

When planning your retirement abroad, consider the following:

*   **Don't rely solely on CPP and OAS**: Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Use online tools**: Utilize resources like Numbeo to compare costs of living, including rent, food, and utilities, in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Strategic withdrawal**: Delaying CPP to age 70 and strategically managing RRSP withdrawals from age 65 to 69 can help lower taxes early and maximize CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Consider visa requirements**: Many countries, like Mexico and Portugal, have specific visa requirements for retirees based on savings or passive income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Spain's non-lucrative visa requires a higher annual income, which might necessitate planning adjustments like saving longer or adjusting withdrawal strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

Retiring abroad can be a transformative experience, but it demands careful planning regarding [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Canadian retirement benefits]], [[managing_canadian_income_tax_obligations_after_leaving_canada | tax obligations]], and [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

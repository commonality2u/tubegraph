Moving expenses are costs incurred when you relocate to a new home in Canada to be closer to your place of work or to attend a post-secondary institution full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These expenses can be deducted from your income, potentially saving thousands of dollars in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Eligibility for Claiming Moving Expenses

To be eligible to claim moving expenses, you must meet specific criteria:
*   You must move at least 40 km closer to your new work or school location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   The move must be within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Deductible Expenses

Eligible moving expenses can include:
*   Transportation and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Travel expenses, such as gas, meals, and accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Temporary living expenses for up to 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Costs associated with selling your old home, notably real estate commissions, which can be a significant amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   The cost of buying your new home, including legal fees and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Example Calculation

Consider Emma, who moved 300 kilometers for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Her expenses were:
*   Moving company: $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Travel expenses: $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Temporary living expenses: $500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Real estate commission for selling her old home: $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>

Her total eligible expenses amounted to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. If her income for that year was $70,000, deducting the $8,000 in moving expenses would reduce her taxable income to $62,000 ($70,000 - $8,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This reduction results in significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

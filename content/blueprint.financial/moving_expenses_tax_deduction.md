In Canada, one way to potentially increase your bank account is by reducing the amount spent on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. The government refunded over $30 billion to Canadians for returns received from February to June in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite this, only 18% of Canadians feel they understand the tax credits and benefits they are entitled to, indicating many opportunities for tax refunds and [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | deductions]] that could save thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

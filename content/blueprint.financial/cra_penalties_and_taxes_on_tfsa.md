Did you know your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can be [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | penalized and taxed by the CRA]]? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> There are three primary "red flags" to avoid to keep your TFSA truly tax-free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

## Red Flag #1: Turning Your TFSA Into a Business

The first red flag is treating your TFSA like a business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

### The Fared Ahamed Case

Fared Ahamed, an investment advisor, opened his TFSA in 2009 with $15,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> Within three years, this grew to $617,000. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> However, this dream turned into a nightmare when the CRA got involved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>

Ahamed was not merely buying and holding stocks; he was engaged in high-volume trading, primarily with penny stocks, flipping them rapidly, sometimes within hours or days. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a> The CRA determined that the nature and frequency of his trades indicated he was running a business within his TFSA, rather than just investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> Consequently, his $617,000 was reclassified as taxable business income, leading to hefty tax bills and potential penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> Ahamed's appeal was unsuccessful, making his case a cautionary tale. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

### Why the CRA Cares About Day Trading

Day trading involves quick buys and sells to profit from small price changes and is considered risky. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> The CRA does not view this as the intended activity for a TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> They scrutinize trading patterns and may deem an individual to be running a business if they are:
*   Flipping stocks like a "pro trader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>
*   Using short holding periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Employing expert strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Using borrowed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

The ironic part is that the CRA will only focus on your TFSA if you are a *successful* day trader. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> Once deemed a business, every dollar earned becomes taxable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>

### How to Stay on the CRA's Good Side

The CRA does not provide a definitive rule book for what constitutes "too much trading." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> Evaluations are done on a case-by-case basis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> The key is to:
*   Keep your TFSA looking like a long-term investing and savings vehicle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Stick to investments you plan to hold for a while, such as ETFs, Blue Chip stocks, or bonds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Avoid flipping stocks too frequently or using leverage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

## Red Flag #2: [[Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs and its penalties | Overcontribution to Your TFSA]]

Another significant red flag is [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontributing]] to your TFSA. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

### The $639,950 Overcontribution Case

In 2020, one taxpayer [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontributed]] $639,950 to their TFSA using borrowed funds from a line of credit, aiming to invest in stocks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> This plan backfired spectacularly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>

Under the Income Tax Act, any [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontribution]] to a TFSA incurs a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> For this individual, it resulted in a $6,393 monthly penalty for every month of [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontribution]] in 2020, plus additional penalties and interest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>

The taxpayer claimed ignorance of the rules and blamed their financial institution, pleading for leniency due to financial hardship and significant investment losses (up to 50%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> Critically, they did not withdraw the excess funds when instructed by the CRA, hoping for market recovery. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> The Federal Court ruled against them, stating the [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontribution]] was not a reasonable error and the delay in removing funds violated rules for prompt correction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>

### Non-Resident Contributions

[[Changes to TFSA when leaving Canada | Contributing to your TFSA when you are no longer a Canadian resident]] is another way [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontributions]] can occur. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> If you move abroad but continue to contribute, the CRA will apply the same 1% monthly penalty on every dollar contributed while living outside Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> For example, Jessica moved to the US and contributed $6,000 to her TFSA, unaware that non-residents cannot contribute. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> Because she didn't catch the mistake for several years, she accumulated thousands of dollars in penalties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

### Common Overcontribution Mistakes

*   **Trusting the CRA's online contribution limits:** The CRA's online records may not always be up to date. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> Always keep your own detailed records to avoid accidental [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontribution]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   **Re-contributing in the same year:** [[Taxfree savings account TFSA withdrawals | Withdrawing from your TFSA]] does not immediately restore contribution room in the same calendar year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> Room from withdrawals only resets on January 1 of the following calendar year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>
*   **Not transferring investments in kind:** When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the cash into your TFSA can inadvertently cause [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | overcontribution]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> It's safer to transfer investments "in kind" without selling them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>

## Red Flag #3: [[Prohibited investments in TFSA | Prohibited Investments in a TFSA]]

Your TFSA has clear restrictions on what you can invest in. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>

### Types of Prohibited Investments

*   **Significant interest holdings:** Owning 10% or more of a private company's shares is prohibited. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>
*   **[[Nonarms length transactions and TFSA | Non-arms length relationships]]:** Investments in businesses where you or your family have significant control or influence are banned. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> The CRA aims to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>

### Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The penalties for [[prohibited_investments_in_tfsa | prohibited investments]] are severe:
*   **50% Special Tax:** If your TFSA acquires a [[prohibited_investments_in_tfsa | prohibited investment]], you'll face a tax equal to 50% of the fair market value of the investment at the time of acquisition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains:** Any income or capital gains earned from [[prohibited_investments_in_tfsa | prohibited investments]] are taxed at 100%, effectively nullifying any benefit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>

For example, investing $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative could be deemed prohibited due to your close connection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> If your shares grow to $50,000, the result would be a 50% tax ($25,000) on the value, and the shares would need to be removed from your TFSA, meaning future gains would no longer be tax-free. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

### How to Stay Safe

Always consult the CRA's guidelines and review their list of qualified investments to ensure compliance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>

Your TFSA is a powerful wealth-building tool, but only if used wisely and by avoiding these [[red_flags_to_avoid_with_tfsa | red flags]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>

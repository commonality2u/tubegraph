When comparing TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) savings by gender, data indicates that women tend to save more than men in their TFSAs at nearly every age range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This trend is observed despite the existing income gap in Canada, where men generally earn more than women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Average TFSA Balances by Age and Gender

The differences in average TFSA balances between genders are evident across various age groups:

*   **Under 20:** Women's average TFSA balance is close to $4,000, while men's is around $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This is notable given that individuals in this age group likely have limited income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It suggests that women may be more inclined to start saving early and develop strong financial habits sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **20 to 24:** The trend of women having higher savings continues, with women saving about $7,000 on average compared to $6,000 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Late 20s (25 to 29):** The gender gap persists, with women's average balance reaching approximately $11,264, while men's holds at around $10,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **30s (30 to 34):** In this age group, the gap almost closes, with men slightly ahead at $13,920 compared to women's $13,716 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This could be the point where the gender income gap begins to play a larger role in savings ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **40s and 50s:** As Canadians move through their 40s and 50s, women begin to pull ahead once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   In the 40 to 49 age group, women hold an average of about $20,680 compared to $20,640 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   By ages 50 to 54, women lead with $27,000, while men have around $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   This might reflect a more conservative approach to spending and saving, as well as a heightened focus on long-term financial security as retirement approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **60s (60 to 64):** The gap remains, with women holding about $40,240 compared to men's $39,182 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This could be due to factors such as higher life expectancy and a more cautious withdrawal strategy in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Insights and Contributing Factors

It is notable that women maintain higher average TFSA balances despite the well-known income gap in Canada, where men earn an average of 36% more than women (e.g., $66,000 for men vs. $48,000 for women in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

This suggests that women may be prioritizing savings and making strategic decisions with their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Factors potentially driving these higher balances include:
*   Conservative spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   A strong focus on long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Lower-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>

These trends demonstrate that saving habits can often matter more than income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. With smart financial habits, even those with lower incomes can build significant long-term wealth through vehicles like the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

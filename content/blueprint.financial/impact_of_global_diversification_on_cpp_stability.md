The **Canada Pension Plan (CPP)** maintains its stability partly due to its globally [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | diversified investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. This approach helps to mitigate risk and enhance the fund's long-term resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### Diversified Global Portfolio

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | CPP fund]] is diversified across 56 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Its investments span various asset classes, including:
*   Public and private equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>
*   Infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>
*   Real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>
*   Fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>

Only 12% of the CPP's portfolio is invested in Canada, with the remaining portion spread across international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>.

### Impact on Stability

This global diversification strategy is crucial for the fund's stability because it:
*   **Reduces "home risk"** by avoiding heavy reliance on any single economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **Enhances overall fund stability** through a broad geographical distribution of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

The fund's ability to outperform expectations in the long run demonstrates the success of its [[investment_strategies_and_management_of_cpp | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_performance_and_growth | CPP Investments]] reported a 10-year net nominal return of 9.2% per year and a 5-year net nominal return of 7.7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. This performance has contributed to the fund's assets reaching $632 billion, surpassing initial projections by over $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

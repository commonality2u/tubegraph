Many Canadians have built seven-figure Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) not by being the highest earners or stock-picking geniuses, but by following a set of key principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These individuals share common "secrets" that allow them to build substantial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Principle 1: Making RRSP Contributions "Hurt" (In a Good Way)

Unlike average savers who contribute what feels comfortable, [[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] push themselves to save more, even when it's a little uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This approach is likened to a tough workout where soreness signifies progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Most people save whatever is left after expenses, often resulting in little to no savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Paying RRSP First
[[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] prioritize their RRSP contributions, paying themselves before rent, bills, or any other expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. They view RRSP savings as non-optional, similar to rent or mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Force Scarcity Trick
This strategy involves increasing RRSP contributions every time a raise is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For example, if they get a 5% raise, they might immediately increase their RRSP contributions by 2-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This way, they don't feel or miss the extra money, as it's diverted to savings before it can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They also round up their savings, pushing a $500 monthly saving goal to $550 or $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This small, consistent stretch accumulates significantly over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Avoiding Lifestyle Creep
While most people upgrade their lifestyle with every raise (new car, bigger apartment), [[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] prioritize upgrading their savings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Finding the Right Balance
It's crucial to find a balance in saving; pushing too hard can lead to burnout, while not pushing enough results in stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. If saving causes stress, isolation, or consistently saying no to valued activities, it might be "overtraining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Why This Works
Consider Jennifer, who saves whatever is left each month, often resulting in $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. In contrast, John follows a "painful but productive" method, contributing at least $600 a month and increasing contributions with every raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. After 30 years, John retires with hundreds of thousands more than Jennifer, due to his consistency and willingness to push himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. As Warren Buffett stated, "Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Principle 2: Automating Savings & Contributions

[[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] understand that building wealth doesn't solely rely on discipline, but also on tricking oneself into saving more through automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Pre-Authorized Contributions
Setting up pre-authorized RRSP contributions ensures money is transferred automatically on payday, preventing opportunities to spend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Automatic Annual Increases
They arrange for a 1% automatic increase in contributions annually, allowing savings to grow effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Reinvesting RRSP Tax Refunds
Instead of spending their tax refunds on vacations or gadgets, [[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] reinvest them back into their RRSP, potentially adding tens or hundreds of thousands to their portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This contrasts with common [[rrsp_tax_refund_misconceptions_and_optimization|RRSP tax refund misconceptions and optimization]] approaches.

### Taking Advantage of Free Money
*   **Employer RRSP Matching:** They never leave employer matching contributions on the table, maximizing this "free money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **[[spousal_rrsp_contributions_for_tax_efficiency|Spousal RRSPs]]:** They utilize [[spousal_rrsp_contributions_for_tax_efficiency|spousal RRSPs]] to balance taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Deduction Carry Forwards:** They claim deduction carry forwards strategically when it results in the most significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Why This Works
James tries to save manually, remembering to transfer money to his RRSP some months, but often forgetting or needing the money for other things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Sophie, however, automates all her RRSP contributions, which occur without her intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. By retirement, Sophie is significantly wealthier because she removed human error from the saving equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Principle 3: Stoic Investing

[[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] adopt a stoic approach to investing, controlling what they can and ignoring what they cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Many investors are swayed by emotion, reacting impulsively to market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. In contrast, stoic investors follow a rules-based system and stick to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This approach helps avoid [[problems_with_rrsp_investment_strategies|problems with RRSP investment strategies]] driven by emotion.

### Ignoring Market Noise
Stoic investors disregard the daily financial media filled with doom and hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. They recognize that short-term market moves are irrelevant to their long-term success and remain focused on their plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Not Letting Fear or Greed Control
When stocks are high, average investors get greedy, chasing "hot stocks" and making risky bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. When the market drops, they panic sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. [[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaires]] do the opposite; they don't get caught up in hype or panic during downturns, trusting their strategy to beat emotional decisions in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### Accepting Volatility as Part of the Game
Markets naturally fluctuate, but most people panic at portfolio drops, mistaking temporary losses for permanent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Stoic investors see downturns as buying opportunities, continuing to invest with the knowledge that markets recover and grow over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Why This Works
Josh, the emotional investor, checks his portfolio constantly, panicking and selling during drops, and rushing to buy hot stocks during rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This often leads him to sell low and buy high, hurting his returns due to emotional decisions and added trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Ashley, the stoic investor, invests consistently, unaffected by day-to-day market news, and continues contributing to her RRSP regardless of market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. After 30 years, Ashley is far wealthier, not from brilliant stock picks, but from staying calm and adhering to her plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Major Mistake: Lack of RRSP Exit Strategy

Even many [[rrsp_savings_strategies_by_age_group|RRSP millionaire]] clients make a costly mistake: focusing solely on growing their RRSP without a plan for [[importance_of_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies|tax-efficient withdrawal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Without an exit strategy, they risk paying significantly more in taxes during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### The Problem
RRSPs are tax-deferred, not tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While contributions lower current taxable income, every dollar withdrawn is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Without a plan, large sums could be withdrawn at a high tax rate, or heirs could face a substantial tax bill upon the account holder's death, as the RRSP is fully taxed then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Solutions and Approaches for [[strategies_to_minimize_rrsp_tax_burdens|Tax Minimization Strategies for RRIF]] and [[taxefficient_rrsp_withdrawal_strategies|Tax-efficient RRSP Withdrawal Strategies]]
*   **Early Withdrawals:** Starting withdrawals earlier can spread taxable income and prevent tax spikes when RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) withdrawals begin after age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Shifting Funds to TFSA:** Transferring funds to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) allows investments to continue growing tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Coordinating Withdrawals:** Aligning RRSP withdrawals with other income sources like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) can help avoid higher tax brackets and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning with Life Insurance:** Life insurance policies can offset the tax burden upon death, ensuring more wealth remains with the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Most retirees unknowingly lose tens of thousands of dollars in taxes by failing to properly plan their RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

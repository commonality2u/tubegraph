Many Canadians are choosing to retire abroad, seeking to escape high costs and taxes, and address concerns about outliving their [[financial_planning_for_retirees | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This strategy allows them to stretch their money further, often enabling a more comfortable lifestyle than in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Canadian Retirement Challenge

Living in Canada can be expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income, which might have been sufficient 30 years ago, often falls short in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For example, a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto averages about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. With additional costs like $200 for utilities, $400 for groceries, and a $150 transit pass, monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000 for a modest lifestyle without homeownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. CPP and OAS combined barely cover a third of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Numbeo data suggests a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, escalating to $3,500 to $4,000 monthly with a one-bedroom rental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This financial pressure leads many Canadians to delay retirement or seek options abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, a hypothetical individual retiring in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   He spends approximately $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   He receives about $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   The remainder is covered by RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Initially, his plan seems viable, but issues quickly arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. By age 70, his TFSA is depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, and by 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals, taking out over $46,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Effective tax rates on these withdrawals creep above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. By age 74, Seth runs out of savings, and by 76, his net worth turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Even with a modest lifestyle, his savings couldn't sustain his high costs in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Top Destinations for Canadian Retirees

Retiring abroad can transform financial outcomes, allowing savings to stretch further and provide a better quality of life.

### Mexico

Mexico is a popular choice for Canadian retirees due to its warm climate, affordability, and proximity to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

*   **Lifestyle**: Offers year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Private clinics are modern, affordable, and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper (e.g., 20% of Canadian prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners, making private insurance essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visa**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring approximately $103,000 CAD in savings, depending on the consulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom apartment spends around $1,700 CAD per month, totaling about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Seth's Outcome in Cancun**: With the same savings as in Toronto ($281,000), but with much lower expenses, Seth's CPP and OAS cover most costs, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. His portfolio grows:
    *   Age 70: $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    *   Age 80: $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
    *   Age 90: Over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
    This demonstrates the significant impact of location on [[strategies_for_balancing_spending_and_saving_in_retirement | financial stability]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal

Portugal offers a relaxed European lifestyle with old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable living costs for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Lifestyle**: Mild winters, sunny summers, and beach weather nearly all year in the Algarve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Porto and Lisbon are cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with access to the public system for residents and affordable private care widely used by expats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring steady income (e.g., CPP, pensions, investments) of about €870 per month ($1,400 CAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: Between Canada and Mexico in cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In cities like Porto, rent can be around $1,300 per month, with other expenses adding $1,700, leading to a total of about $3,000 per month ($36,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Seth's Outcome in Portugal**: With $281,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, Seth covers the rest by drawing down his TFSA first, then his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   By age 75, savings drop to around $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   By age 80, he's down to just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   By age 84, his savings are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    Portugal offers a better runway than Toronto, but for Seth's initial plan, it still wasn't enough to last past age 90, which is often a target for [[financial_planning_for_retirees | long-term planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

#### Small Adjustments to Seth's Plan

Seth could make smart adjustments to extend his savings, applying [[tips_for_managing_retirement_budgets | budget management]] and [[strategies_for_maximizing_retirement_income | income maximization]] principles:
*   **Delay CPP to age 70**: This allows CPP to grow to its maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Melt down RRSP from age 65 to 69**: This covers the income gap and potentially lowers early taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
This single move extends his savings by another two years, running out at age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Further adjustments could include working an extra year, trimming spending, earning from a hobby, or rethinking travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Thailand

Thailand is a top-value retirement destination, offering diverse environments from mountains to beaches, a developed expat scene, and rich culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and highly regarded, with many doctors speaking English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visa**: To qualify for a retirement visa, individuals must be 50 years or older and show 800,000 Thai Baht (about $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: A full lifestyle in Chiang Mai, including rent, food, and leisure, can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. For someone like Seth, receiving $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this means basic needs are covered, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay

Paraguay is an emerging option, not just for its low cost but also its tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Taxes**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income (like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions) is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asunción, living expenses are about $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent around $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This allows for a good lifestyle on just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Offers simple paths to permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Financial Sweet Spot**: For Seth, Paraguay represents a financial sweet spot due to its very low cost, tax efficiency, and ease of settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain

Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents like Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,057, with a city center one-bedroom rent at about $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Total monthly expenses are roughly $2,400-$2,500, comparable to parts of Canada or slightly cheaper than some areas in Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Visa**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, which requires about $40,000-$45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is a higher bar but achievable with prior planning, such as earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Critical Financial Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### Old Age Security (OAS) Rules

A significant mistake is losing OAS payments when moving abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **In Canada**: Only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are required to qualify for OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Outside Canada**: 20 years of Canadian residency are required to continue receiving OAS payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Interim Period**: If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving Canada, unless your destination country has a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

For instance, David, aged 67, had 15 years of Canadian residency and started collecting OAS in Calgary. When he retired to Thailand (which has no social security agreement with Canada), his OAS stopped after 6 months because he did not meet the 20-year mark for payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Understanding these rules is crucial to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### General Financial Planning Tips

*   **Cost Comparison**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs of rent, food, and utilities in potential retirement destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Beyond Government Pensions**: Do not rely solely on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Factors like inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. [[diversifying_retirement_income | Diversifying income sources]] is key.
*   **Tax Implications**: Be aware of the [[tax_implications_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax implications for Canadian retirees abroad]], as failing to plan can lead to significant financial traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This also includes understanding the [[impact_on_rrsp_when_moving_abroad | impact on RRSP when moving abroad]].
*   **Personal Suitability**: Life abroad isn't for everyone; consider the distance from family, adapting to new systems, and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

A low-cost retirement can be rewarding, but it must be supported by a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Where you live transforms your retirement, but it also involves complex tax rules and major financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

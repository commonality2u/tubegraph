From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

The average [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of raising a child]] in Canada from birth to age 17 is estimated at $293,000, or approximately $17,235 per year for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. This amount is comparable to the cost of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

Families earning over $135,000 annually tend to spend more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. In contrast, families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a significant tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It can cover a substantial portion of the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of raising a child]], potentially over 50% for lower-income families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

Key features of the CCB include:
*   **Indexed to inflation**: The payment amounts grow over time to keep pace with [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | rising costs]], meaning future payments will be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Tax-free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions or surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Maximum Payments

The maximum CCB payments over 18 years for one child can be up to $125,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Breakdown per child:
*   **For children under six**: Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **For children aged 6 to 17**: The annual maximum is $6,570, adding up to $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Total for one child**: Up to $125,512 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

There is no limit to the number of children for whom you can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>:
*   **One child**: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
*   **Two children**: Doubles to $251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Three children**: Reaches $376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
*   A family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### Spending the CCB Money

There are no restrictions on how the CCB money can be spent; families can use it for any needs, such as food, housing, education, or household upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## CCB Eligibility and Calculation

The CCB is based on a family's Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, it's the combined income of both spouses minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

As net income increases, the CCB decreases, with lower-income families receiving the full benefit and higher-income families seeing reduced or no payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

The reduction happens in two stages:
1.  **Income between $36,525 and $79,000**: The CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Income above $79,000**: An additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over $79,000 after the initial reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

**Example for one child under six (annual benefit)**:
*   **$35,000 or less net income**: Full benefit of $7,777 per year ($649 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **$50,000 net income**: Reduced to about $6,884 per year ($570 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **$100,000 net income**: Drops significantly to around $2,776 per year ($231 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   **$130,000 net income**: Further reduces to about $1,814 per year ($151 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   At very high income levels, the benefit is phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

For exact numbers, especially with multiple children, the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) CCB calculator is recommended, or contacting the CRA directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Getting Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward as the CRA automatically calculates payments once taxes are filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. No additional application is needed, provided you and your partner file taxes annually and your child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>.

For faster payments, setting up direct deposit with the CRA is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. CCB payments are typically issued between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.

It is crucial to keep your information updated with the CRA. Changes in family income (e.g., job loss), life events (e.g., marriage, birth, divorce), or shared custody arrangements should be reported immediately, as they may impact eligibility for higher payments or require payment adjustments (e.g., 50/50 split in joint custody) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of the CCB

The CCB was introduced as a key tool to reduce child poverty and support families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Its impact has been substantial:
*   In 2021 alone, it helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
*   It supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   The CCB also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

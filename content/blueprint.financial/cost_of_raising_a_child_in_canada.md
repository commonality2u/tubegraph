From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This figure is comparable to the cost of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. For a two-parent, middle-income family, this averages out to approximately $17,235 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Varying Costs Based on Income

The cost of raising a child can vary significantly based on family income:
*   **Higher-Income Families** Families earning over $135,000 annually tend to spend more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Lower-Income Families** Families earning less than $83,000 spend approximately 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## The Role of the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_canada_child_benefit | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It can significantly offset the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | financial burden]] of raising children, with potential total benefits of up to $125,500 per child over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### CCB Payment Breakdown Per Child
The maximum CCB payments are broken down by age:
*   **Children Under Six** Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,722 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Children Aged 6 to 17** An annual maximum of $6,570, adding up to $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Total Over 18 Years** Altogether, this amounts to $125,500 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Impact on Overall Costs
For lower-income families, the CCB could potentially cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Multiple Children and CCB
There is no limit to the number of children for whom a family can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   **One child** Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Two children** Doubles to $251,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Three children** A total of $376,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Large Families** A family with 18 children in Abbotsford could theoretically receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Key Features of CCB
The CCB has two important features:
1.  **Indexed to Inflation** The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  **Tax-Free** Every dollar received is tax-free, with no deductions or surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Spending the CCB Funds
Families have complete flexibility in how they spend the CCB money; there are no restrictions. Funds can be used for necessities like food, housing, education, or any other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_canada_child_benefit | Eligibility and Calculation]]

The CCB amount is based on a family's adjusted family net income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, AFNI combines both spouses' incomes minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. As net income increases, the CCB decreases, meaning lower-income families receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced or no payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Income-Based Reductions
The reduction in CCB occurs in two stages:
1.  **Stage 1** If AFNI is between $36,525 and $79,849, the CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,000, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
2.  **Stage 2** If AFNI is above approximately $79,000 (after the initial reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over the $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

#### Example for One Child Under Six
*   **Families earning $35,000 or less** Receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year ($649 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Families earning $50,000** Annual benefit reduced to about $6,840 ($570 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Families earning $100,000** Annual benefit drops to around $2,776 ($231 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Families earning $130,000** Benefit reduces further to about $1,814 per year ($151 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

At very high income levels, the benefit is phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. For exact numbers, the Canada Revenue Agency's (CRA) CCB calculator can provide accurate results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Receiving Payments
The CRA automatically calculates and issues CCB payments once taxes are filed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. No extra application is needed, provided both partners file taxes annually and the child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the climate action incentive payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Payments are typically made between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Setting up direct deposit with the CRA can ensure faster payment receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Keeping Information Up-to-Date
It is crucial to update the CRA if a family's income changes (e.g., job loss, marriage, birth of a new baby, or divorce) or if there are changes in shared custody arrangements, as this can affect payment eligibility and amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. In joint custody situations, payments are typically split 50/50 between parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Purpose of the CCB
The CCB is a key government tool aimed at [[impact_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | reducing child poverty]] and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone, supporting 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging family growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

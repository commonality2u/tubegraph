From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

The average cost of raising a child in Canada from birth to age 17 is estimated at a significant $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, or approximately $17,235 per year for a two-parent middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This amount is comparable to the cost of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. It can potentially cover a substantial portion of child-raising expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Key Features of the CCB
*   **Indexed to inflation**: The payment amount increases over time to keep pace with [[impact_of_inflation_on_grocery_costs_in_canada | rising costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Tax-free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### What Can CCB Money Be Used For?
There are no restrictions on how CCB funds can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Families can use it for:
*   Food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   Housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   Education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   Other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>

## CCB Payment Breakdown

A family can receive up to $125,500 per child over 18 years, tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Maximum Annual Payments
*   **Children under six**: Up to $7,778 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   Totals $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Children aged 6 to 17**: Up to $6,570 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
    *   Totals $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Total Payments Over 18 Years
Combining these, the maximum CCB for one child over 18 years is up to $125,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Impact of Multiple Children
There is no limit to the number of children for whom one can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **One child**: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Two children**: Approximately $251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Three children**: Approximately $376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   An Abbotsford family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Cost of Raising a Child by Income Level

The cost of raising a child varies significantly with family income:
*   **Middle-income families**: Average $293,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Families earning over $135,000 annually**: Spend even more, averaging $43,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. (Note: Transcript says $43,000 per child, which seems low compared to total cost figures, likely an error in the transcript).
*   **Families earning less than $83,000**: Spend about 52% less than middle-income families, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB could cover over 50% of the total cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## CCB Eligibility and Calculation

The [[impact_of_income_on_canada_child_benefit | Canada Child Benefit]] is based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, this is the combined income of both spouses minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   As your AFNI increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Lower-income families receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced or no payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Benefit Reduction Stages
The reduction happens in two stages:
1.  **Income between $36,525 and $79,000**: CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
2.  **Income above $79,000**: An additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over $79,000, after the initial $3,000 reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Example: CCB Reduction for One Child Under Six
*   **Income $35,000 or less**: Receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year, or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Income $50,000**: Annual benefit reduced to about $6,840, or $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Income $100,000**: Annual benefit drops to around $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Income $130,000**: Benefit further reduces to about $1,814 per year, or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   At very high income levels, the benefit is phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

For exact numbers with multiple children, the CRA's CCB calculator is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Receiving CCB Payments

### How to Get Paid
The CRA automatically calculates and issues payments once you file your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   No extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Ensure you and your partner file taxes annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Your child must be registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   Set up direct deposit with the CRA for faster payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### Payment Dates
CCB payments are typically issued between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Keeping Information Up-to-Date
It is crucial to inform the CRA about any changes in your family's circumstances, such as:
*   Changes in income (e.g., job loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
*   Life events (e.g., marriage, birth of a new baby, divorce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
*   Changes in shared custody arrangements (CCB payments are typically split 50/50 in joint custody situations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>

Updating this information can qualify you for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of CCB

The CCB is a key government tool for [[effect_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | reducing child poverty]] and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   In 2021 alone, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   The CCB also aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

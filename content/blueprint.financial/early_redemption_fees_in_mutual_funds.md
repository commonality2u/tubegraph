Early redemption fees are a type of hidden investment fee that acts as a costly exit penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These fees are charged by some [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] and other investment products if you sell your investment too soon after buying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact
Often called "short-term trading fees," these charges are intended to discourage quick turnover and help maintain fund stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. However, they can significantly reduce your investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Where You'll Find Them
Early redemption fees are generally found in [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Many [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] charge these fees if units are sold within a specific period, typically 30 to 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The fee usually ranges from 1% to 2% of the investment's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Example
For instance, an RBC US Equity Fund may have a short-term trading fee of 2% on the value of units sold or switched within 7 days of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Long-Term Holding** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>: Hold your investments for longer periods to avoid triggering redemption penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Choose ETFs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>: Consider investing in ETFs instead of [[comparison_with_traditional_mutual_funds | mutual funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

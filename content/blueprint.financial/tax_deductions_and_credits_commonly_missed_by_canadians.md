Tax season is an opportunity to keep more of your hard-earned money, but certain simple mistakes can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) cross-checks income records, and forgetting to report income can lead to penalties and audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Many Canadians also overlook valuable [[lesserknown_canadian_tax_deductions | tax deductions]] and [[common_and_overlooked_tax_credits_for_canadians | tax credits]] that could reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Common Tax Filing Mistakes to Avoid

Ignoring key aspects of tax filing can lead to missed savings or penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Here are some common mistakes Canadians make:

### 1. Forgetting to Report All Income

The CRA has access to T4s, T5s, and other income records, which they cross-check against your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Failing to report employment income, rental income, side hustle earnings, or investment dividends can result in penalties and a potential audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now report income directly to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return and previously missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA might impose a penalty of 10% of the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Always check your My CRA account to confirm all tax slips are included before filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Keeping accurate records of all income sources helps prevent costly tax surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### 2. Overcontributing to RRSPs or TFSAs

Exceeding your RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) or TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) contribution limit can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Excess RRSP contributions are subject to a 1% monthly penalty until withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   TFSA contributions incur a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

These mistakes often happen because taxpayers don't carefully track their contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Many assume the CRA will notify them, but penalties can accumulate quietly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Track your own contributions rather than relying solely on your My CRA account, as it isn't always updated in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If you realize you've overcontributed, withdraw the excess as soon as possible to minimize penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. You are allowed to exceed your RRSP limit by up to $2,000 without incurring penalties, providing a small buffer for RRSPs, but not for TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 3. Missing Out on Valuable Deductions and Credits

Many Canadians miss out on [[overlooked_canadian_tax_breaks | valuable tax deductions]] and [[common_and_overlooked_tax_credits_for_canadians | credits]] that could significantly reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Commonly missed deductions include:
*   **[[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions_in_canada | Medical expenses]]**: This includes prescription drugs, dental treatments, and travel costs for medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Moving expenses**: Deductible if you moved for work or school in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Union and professional membership dues**: These can also be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Tuition credits**: Students often forget they can carry forward unused tuition credits or transfer them to a parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Review your eligibility for these deductions, as it can lead to a larger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Always keep receipts and records, as the CRA may request proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For a deeper dive, explore other resources on [[common_and_overlooked_tax_credits_for_canadians | tax deductions]] you must claim in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### 4. Claiming Ineligible Write-Offs

The CRA is strict about [[simple_tax_deductions_for_Canadian_small_businesses | business]] and employment [[intermediate_tax_writeoffs_for_businesses_in_canada | deductions]], and incorrect claims can lead to audits and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Home office expenses**: Only deductible if your workspace is your primary place of work or used exclusively for work-related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Eligible expenses include utilities, rent, and internet for that portion of your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **[[simple_tax_deductions_for_Canadian_small_businesses | Business expenses]]**: Deductions for meals, travel, and vehicle costs must be reasonable, directly related to earning income, and supported by receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Personal expenses disguised as business costs can be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Paying family members**: If you hire a spouse or child, their salary must reflect actual work performed; unjustified payments may be rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 5. Forgetting to Claim Capital Losses

If you've sold investments (stocks, ETFs) or property at a loss, you may be able to use those losses to offset capital gains and reduce your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The CRA allows you to carry forward capital losses indefinitely or apply them to the past three years of gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Many investors forget to claim these losses, leading to higher taxes than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Keep track of your investment transactions and report losses in the same year they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Even if you don't have gains this year, filing them for future use can be a valuable tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### 6. Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency

If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (stocks, real estate, offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Failure to do so can lead to hefty penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Cryptocurrency is also on the CRA's radar, and unreported gains from selling or trading crypto can result in a tax audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Some crypto exchanges now report transactions to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Keep detailed records of foreign assets and crypto trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Report all taxable gains and ensure you're following the correct tax rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### 7. Overlooking Income Splitting Opportunities

Income splitting can significantly reduce a household's overall tax burden, but many Canadians fail to take advantage of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Spousal RRSP contributions**: The higher-earning spouse can contribute to the lower-earning spouse's RRSP, leading to [[retirement_tax_credits_in_canada | tax savings in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Pension income splitting**: [[tax_saving_tips_for_Canadian_retirees | Retirees]] can split up to 50% of eligible pension income, lowering their combined tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **TFSA and FHSA accounts**: These are excellent for income splitting since they aren't subject to income attribution rules, allowing spouses or family members to contribute and grow investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### 8. Failing to Pay Installments if Required

If you owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec), the CRA may require you to make quarterly tax installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. These usually apply to [[tax_tips_for_selfemployed_canadians | self-employed individuals]], landlords, investors, and high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Missing these payments can lead to interest charges and penalties, as the CRA charges compound daily interest on unpaid amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> You may face an additional penalty if your installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Set reminders and budget accordingly for timely and sufficient installment payments to prevent unnecessary interest costs and large lump-sum tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 9. Ignoring Tax Planning Until April

Tax planning should be a year-round process, not just something done when filing your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Many tax-saving strategies, such as contributing to a FHSA (First Home Savings Account), making charitable donations, and capital loss harvesting, need to be completed before December 31st to count for that tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Waiting until April means missing out on deductions and scrambling to organize documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> [[simple_tax_deductions_for_Canadian_small_businesses | Business owners]] and investors should plan for capital gains, tax-efficient withdrawals, and income splitting throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Set up a tax review before year-end to optimize your strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Using "Autofill My Return" to Prevent Mistakes

The CRA offers a tool called "Autofill My Return" (AMR), built into NetFile certified tax software like TurboTax and Well Simple Tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

**How it works:**
1.  **Instantly pull tax slips**: When you log into your My CRA account and connect it to your tax software, Autofill automatically imports T4s, T5s, RRSP contributions, and other tax slips directly from the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
2.  **Prevents audit triggers**: It ensures that your reported income matches what the CRA expects, reducing the risk of a reassessment from forgotten income sources like a second job, dividend payment, or side hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
3.  **Saves time and finds missed credits**: It eliminates manual data entry and helps identify and claim every possible [[common_and_overlooked_tax_credits_for_canadians | deduction]] and [[common_and_overlooked_tax_credits_for_canadians | credit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

To use it, simply log into your My CRA account before filing, connect your tax software, and import your tax slips with one click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. This eliminates manual entry and helps avoid mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## TFSA Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility for a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is based on three key factors:
1.  **Age:** You must be at least 18 (or 19 in some provinces) to start accumulating TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
2.  **Residency:** You need to be a Canadian resident, as non-residents cannot accumulate new contribution room while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
3.  **SIN Number:** A valid Social Insurance Number (SIN) is required to open and contribute to a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

It is important to note that not everyone will qualify for the full [[tfsa_contribution_limits_for_2025 | $102,000 limit]] (as of 2025); the total available room depends on when you first became eligible for a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Accumulation Examples

Here are some common examples illustrating how TFSA contribution room accumulates based on different eligibility scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>:

### Example 1: Eligible Since 2009 (Alex)
Alex turned 18 in 2009 and has been eligible for a TFSA ever since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. By 2025, Alex will have accumulated the full [[tfsa_contribution_limits_for_2025 | $102,000]] in contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Even if Alex has not contributed anything to his TFSA, he will have the option to invest up to $102,000 tax-free in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Example 2: Turning 18 in 2015 (Sarah)
Sarah turned 18 in 2015, so she was not eligible to accumulate contribution room before then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Her TFSA contribution room began accumulating from 2015, when the limit was $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. By 2025, Sarah will have accumulated $72,000 in total contribution room, starting from the year she turned 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Example 3: Becoming a Canadian Resident in 2020 (David)
David moved to Canada and became a resident in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He began accumulating TFSA contribution room from that year onward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By 2025, David will have $38,500 in available contribution room, as his accumulation started only when he became a resident in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Example 4: Non-Resident Status (Emily)
Emily lived in Canada and contributed to her TFSA since 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In 2019, she moved abroad to Costa Rica and became a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. By that time, she had accumulated $57,500 in contribution room, including the 2019 limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. After becoming a non-resident, she stopped accumulating new room, so no additional contribution room was added after 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Although Emily can keep her existing TFSA while living abroad, she will not accumulate new contribution room as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

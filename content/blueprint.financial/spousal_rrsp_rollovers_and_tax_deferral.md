Upon the death of an individual, their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance is generally added to their income for that year and taxed at their highest marginal tax rate, which can be as high as 53% in Ontario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. For example, an RRSP balance of $700,000 could result in $371,000 in taxes, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

To mitigate this significant tax impact, [[spousal_rrsp_contributions_in_canada | spousal RRSP rollovers]] offer an effective strategy to defer taxes and preserve wealth for loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## How Spousal Rollovers Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

If an individual has a spouse or common-law partner, their entire RRSP balance can be rolled over to the surviving partner's RRSP or Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) tax-free upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This means no immediate taxes are due, allowing the surviving spouse to defer paying taxes until they begin withdrawing funds from the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Example: Michael and Emily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

If Michael passes away with an RRSP balance of $700,000, instead of his estate being taxed 53% on this amount, the funds can be transferred tax-free to his wife Emily's RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Emily will not owe taxes until she starts making withdrawals from her account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Pros of Spousal Rollovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>

*   **Immediate Tax Deferral**: Taxes are not due immediately upon the original RRSP holder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Control over Withdrawals**: The surviving spouse gains control over when to withdraw funds, enabling potential tax savings in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Cons of Spousal Rollovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

*   **Marital Status Requirement**: This strategy only applies if the deceased has a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Temporary Solution**: Taxes are deferred, not eliminated. The tax liability will still be due when the surviving spouse begins withdrawing funds and also when they pass away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This strategy is considered a temporary solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | RRSP Income Splitting]] (Spousal RRSP Contributions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

Another strategy involving spouses is [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | RRSP income splitting]]. This involves the higher-earning spouse contributing to a [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]] in the name of their lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The lower-income spouse can then withdraw these funds gradually in retirement, leading to a lower overall RRSP balance and reducing the large tax hit upon the death of the original RRSP holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

For instance, Mark, in a 45% tax bracket, contributes $20,000 annually to his wife Susan's spousal RRSP. Susan is expected to be in a 20% tax bracket during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Mark receives a tax deduction at his higher rate, and Susan's withdrawals are taxed at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This approach reduces the overall balance of Mark's RRSP by the time he passes away, leading to a smaller tax bill for his estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

#### Pros:
*   **Reduced RRSP Balance at Death**: Shifting withdrawals to a lower-income spouse reduces the RRSP balance, lowering the tax bill when one spouse passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Tax-Efficient Withdrawals**: Allows for lower tax rates during retirement and at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

#### Cons:
*   **Income Disparity Required**: Only effective if one spouse is in a lower income bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Careful Planning**: Requires careful planning and consistent contributions to a spousal RRSP over time to achieve maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Combining Strategies for [[estate_planning_and_rrsp | Estate Planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>

Financial planning can involve combining multiple strategies for optimal tax efficiency. For example, Jerry, who earns more than Kim, contributes to her [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | spousal RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. In retirement, Kim withdraws from her RRSP at a lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Concurrently, David (another individual in the example, likely Jerry in context) makes gradual RRSP withdrawals to spread out the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. To further protect their estate, they might purchase life insurance to cover the taxes owed on David's RRSP after he passes, ensuring their children inherit the full estate tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. David could then use his gradual RRSP withdrawals to cover these insurance premiums, reducing the tax hit further and effectively trading RRSP income for a tax-free life insurance payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This combined approach smooths out the tax burden and maximizes inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The average Canadian's RRSP balance experienced a significant decline between 2022 and 2023, dropping by over $30,000 in just one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This downturn resulted in the national [[average_rrsp_balance_trends_and_fluctuations | average RSP account values]] falling to $113,000 in 2023, down from approximately $144,000 in 2022, representing a 28% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While this drop might seem concerning, it actually reflects a return to more typical savings levels after temporary spikes in 2021 and 2022, which were driven by pandemic-related savings habits where people cut expenses and contributed more to their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Understanding the Difference: Median vs. Average

When examining savings data, it is crucial to understand the difference between median and average figures. The median generally provides a more realistic snapshot of what most Canadians have saved, as it is less skewed by very high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Average numbers can be heavily influenced by a small number of individuals with exceptionally large balances. For the data on RRSP holdings by age, information combining RRSPs, RRIFs, and LIRAs from Statistics Canada's latest available information (2019) was used to determine median data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## RRSP Holdings by Age (2019 Data)

There is a significant difference between median and average RRSP holdings across various age groups:

*   **Age 65 and Older**: For this group, the median balance was $224,000, which is well over double the average of $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This stark difference highlights how the average numbers are skewed towards high-income outlier earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Therefore, the median is a more suitable comparison for most individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Under 35**: Younger Canadians have a median of just $12,500 saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This suggests that many young adults have minimal retirement savings, emphasizing the importance of starting early and saving consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **35 to 54 (Midlife Savings Growth)**: Savings improve in these age groups, but the median of $30,000 to $70,000 is still considerably below what is generally needed for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Many individuals in this stage are managing mortgages, family expenses, and careers, which can make prioritizing retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **55 to 64 (Nearing Retirement)**: The median savings for this group grow to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, this amount is often insufficient to sustain a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While some individuals are in better financial shape with an average of over $216,000, many will still need to rely on additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **65+ (Retirees)**: The median savings remain at $100,000 for this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, indicating that many retirees heavily depend on government benefits like CPP, OAS, or other income streams, as private savings alone may not cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Factors Influencing RRSP Balances

### Economic Family Types
RRSP data includes both combined households and individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Households typically exhibit higher savings due to shared financial responsibilities and additional incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. For individuals reviewing this data, it's important to note that household figures will generally be higher than what most individuals might save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Regional Breakdowns (2023 Survey)
The 2023 survey indicates varying RRSP engagement across Canada:
*   Ontario leads with the highest [[average_rrsp_balance_trends_and_fluctuations | average RSP balance]] at $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Atlantic Canada showed the highest average contribution, at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
Despite regional differences, Canadians across the country remain engaged with their RRSPs, either building larger account balances or making consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Household Sizes and Contributions
Larger households tend to contribute more to their RRSPs, likely due to greater collective income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   Two-person households lead, with 4.2 million households contributing and a median contribution of $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Single-person households contribute significantly less overall, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
This pattern suggests that dual-income households are often better positioned to prioritize and increase their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Financial planning, particularly for retirement, is closely tied to household dynamics and available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Age-Based Contribution Patterns (2023 Data)
Despite [[economic_challenges_affecting_rrsp_contributions | economic challenges]] and rising costs, Canadians continue to prioritize their RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   In 2023, the average contribution increased to $651, up from $575 in 2022, demonstrating a steady focus on retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   Contributions vary by age, with those closer to retirement increasing their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The 55 and above age group contributes a median of $5,490, while younger Canadians aged 15 to 24 contribute a median of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This indicates that as Canadians approach retirement, they prioritize growing their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Economic Challenges
Saving for retirement has faced hurdles due to [[economic_challenges_affecting_rrsp_contributions | economic challenges]] like inflation and rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   In 2023, 74% of Canadians were concerned about how inflation and rising prices affected their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   By 2024, 63% of Canadians still reported that current economic conditions negatively impacted their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
Despite these difficulties, Canadians show resilience by continuing to focus on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Regular RRSP contributions are essential for long-term security, even in challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

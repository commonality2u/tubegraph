A significant number of Canadians are opting to permanently leave the country, with many choosing to [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retire abroad]] to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This decision, however, comes with its own set of [[common_retirement_planning_mistakes_and_their_consequences | challenges and potential errors]] if not planned carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## The Canadian Retirement Landscape: A Catalyst for Moving Abroad

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives approximately $1,300 to $1,500 combined from CPP and OAS monthly at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This income is often insufficient to cover modest living expenses, particularly in cities like Toronto, where a one-bedroom apartment rent averages around $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Including utilities, groceries, and transit, monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000, meaning CPP and OAS barely cover a third of basic costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This makes [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement in Canada]] feel like "running on a treadmill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Consider Seth, who retired in Toronto in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Spending about $50,000 annually, relying on $18,000 from CPP and OAS, and supplementing from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>:
*   By age 70, his TFSA was drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relied solely on RRSP withdrawals (over $46,000/year), with taxes eating into savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   By age 74, he was out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   By age 76, his net worth was negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Seth's situation highlights how high costs in a city like Toronto can quickly deplete even a "decent nest egg," underscoring the [[challenges_of_retiring_alone | challenges of retiring alone]] with limited savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## General Challenges When Retiring Abroad

While moving abroad can significantly stretch retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, several [[factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | factors to consider when moving abroad]] present potential difficulties:

*   **Bureaucracy and Patience**: Dealing with local bureaucracy can require "a lot of patience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Language Barriers**: Some proficiency in the local language, such as Spanish in Mexico, "helps a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, and can be "extremely difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Distance from Family**: Being physically separated from family can be "extremely difficult" for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **New Systems**: Adapting to new systems, whether public services or daily routines, can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Costs**: Inflation, currency shifts, or healthcare surprises can "throw off your budget completely," especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Country-Specific Challenges

### Mexico
While a top pick for its warmth and affordability, Mexico presents some trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
*   **Safety Concerns**: Safety "really depends on the region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: Infrastructure can be "hit or miss in the smaller towns and other places" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners, making private insurance "essential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Portugal
Portugal offers a European lifestyle with relatively affordable costs, but still poses financial challenges for some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   **Cost of Living**: Portugal falls between Canada and Mexico in terms of cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Seth's financial modeling showed that even in Porto, with expenses similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending ($3,000/month or $36,000/year), his $300,000 savings would still run out by age 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   This illustrates that even a "softer landing" than Canada can "still end with the hard truth" if the math doesn't work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Spain
Spain offers a desirable European lifestyle, but has a higher barrier to entry for its [[visa_options_for_retiring_abroad | non-lucrative visa]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>:
*   **Income Requirement**: The non-lucrative visa requires approximately $40,000 to $45,000 Canadian per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This is a "higher bar" that might necessitate strategic planning, like earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## The Old Age Security (OAS) Mistake

One significant [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | impact of retiring outside Canada on Canadian benefits]] is the potential loss of OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

> [00:10:55] "Many Canadians don't realize you could lose your OAS payments if you retire abroad without meeting a key rule."
> [00:11:00] "If you apply while living in Canada, you only need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify. But then if you're living outside of Canada, you need 20 years to keep receiving payments long term."
> [00:11:11] "So if you have between 10 and 20 years, say, of living in Canada, you might only get OAS for 6 months after leaving. Unless you're in a country with a social security agreement with Canada."

For example, David, with 15 years of Canadian residency, moved to Thailand after starting OAS payments in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Six months later, his OAS stopped because Thailand lacks a social security agreement with Canada and he didn't meet the 20-year residency mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This highlights a critical error that can result in losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Essential Steps for Planning a Retirement Abroad

To avoid [[common_retirement_planning_mistakes_and_their_consequences | common retirement planning mistakes]] and ensure a successful retirement abroad, it's crucial to have a "solid plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>:

*   **Research Living Costs**: Utilize tools like Numbeo to compare rent, food, and utilities in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Don't Rely Solely on CPP and OAS**: Account for inflation, currency fluctuations, and unexpected healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Understand Tax Implications**: Be aware of tax traps when leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Paraguay, for instance, operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions is not taxed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Plan for Longevity**: People are living longer, so plan for retirement to last at least until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Consider Adjustments**: Small adjustments, like delaying CPP to age 70 while drawing down RRSP early, can significantly extend savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Seek Professional Advice**: Financial planning can help map out costs, taxes, and "what-ifs" to prevent running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

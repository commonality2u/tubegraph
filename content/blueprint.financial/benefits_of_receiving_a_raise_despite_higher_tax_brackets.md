A common misconception exists that receiving a salary [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | raise]] might lead to taking home less money due to being "bumped into a higher tax bracket" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This is a [[myths_about_tax_brackets_and_raises | classic myth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>; it is always beneficial to accept a [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | raise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Understanding Canada's Progressive Tax System

Canada operates on a [[understanding_tax_brackets | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of your income are taxed at different rates, corresponding to specific [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | tax brackets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

For instance, if an individual's current [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]] is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, and they are offered a [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | raise]] that pushes their total income above a certain threshold (e.g., $57,375 for the 20.5% bracket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, only the income earned *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Income earned *below* the threshold remains taxed at the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, if an individual's salary increases from $56,000 to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, the portion up to $57,375 is still taxed at 15%, while only the $2,625 above that amount (up to $60,000) is taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Why a Raise is Always Beneficial

Because of the progressive nature of the tax system, a [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | raise]] always results in a net increase in take-home pay. The higher tax rate only applies to the additional income, not the entire salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Therefore, accepting a [[how_tax_rates_apply_to_salary_raises | raise]] is always financially advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>-<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Many Canadians have successfully built seven-figure RRSPs, not necessarily because they were the highest earners or stock-picking geniuses, but because they followed a set of key principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article outlines three common secrets shared by these individuals, and a major mistake many RRSP millionaires still make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Secret 1: Making RRSP Contributions "Hurt" (in a good way)

Building substantial RRSP wealth is akin to a brutal workout; the initial discomfort is proof of pushing limits and getting stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In contrast, merely saving what's comfortable yields no significant progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. RRSP millionaires push themselves to save more, even when it feels challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The common approach is to save what's left after bills, groceries, and other expenditures, which often results in little to no savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. RRSP millionaires reverse this by prioritizing their RRSP contributions first, before any other expenses like rent or bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. They understand that if they don't force themselves to save, it simply won't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### How they implement this "painful but productive" method:

*   **The Force Scarcity Trick:** They increase RRSP contributions every time they receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For instance, a 5% raise might prompt an immediate 2-3% increase in RRSP contributions, ensuring they don't "feel" or miss the extra money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Treating Savings as Non-Optional:** RRSP savings are viewed like essential payments such as rent or a mortgage; they are not optional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Rounding Up Savings:** If they plan to save $500 a month, they aim to push it to $550 or $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This seemingly small stretch, similar to "squeezing out extra reps at the gym," adds up significantly over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Lifestyle Creep:** Instead of upgrading their lifestyle with every raise (e.g., new car, bigger apartment), RRSP millionaires prioritize upgrading their savings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Finding the Right Balance

It's crucial to find a sweet spot where saving is challenging but not miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. If saving leads to stress, isolation, or constant deprivation of valued activities, it might indicate "overtraining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

As Warren Buffett wisely stated, "Do not save what is left after spending, but spend what is left after saving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Secret 2: Stoic Investing

RRSP millionaires adopt a stoic approach to investing, controlling what they can and ignoring what they can't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Unlike many investors who are swayed by emotion—getting excited when stocks rise, panicking when they fall, and constantly second-guessing decisions—stoic investors adhere to a rules-based system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### What Stoic Investors Do Differently:

*   **Ignoring Market Noise:** They disregard the daily financial media filled with doom, hype, and short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. They know that short-term moves are irrelevant to their long-term success and stay focused on their plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Controlling Fear and Greed:** When stocks hit record highs, average investors might chase hot stocks or take on risky bets. When markets drop, they panic sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. RRSP millionaires do the opposite, trusting their strategy and avoiding emotional decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Accepting Volatility:** They understand that market fluctuations are a normal part of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Instead of panicking during downturns, they see them as buying opportunities, knowing that markets tend to recover and grow over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

This disciplined approach allows stoic investors to build significantly more wealth over the long term, not through brilliant stock picks, but by staying calm and consistently executing their plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Secret 3: Tricking Your Future Self into Being Rich

Many believe building wealth requires immense discipline, but RRSP millionaires know the secret: you can "trick" yourself into saving more without even noticing, primarily through automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### The Secrets to Effortless Saving Through Automation:

*   **Pre-Authorized RRSP Contributions:** They set up automatic contributions to occur on payday, preventing them from having the chance to spend the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Automatic Annual Contribution Increases:** They set up a 1% automatic increase in contributions annually, ensuring savings grow effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting RRSP Tax Refunds:** While many spend their tax refunds on vacations or gadgets, RRSP millionaires reinvest their refunds, potentially adding hundreds of thousands to their portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Maximizing "Free Money":**
    *   **Employer RRSP Matching:** They always take full advantage of employer matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   **Spousal RRSPs:** They utilize spousal RRSPs to balance taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   **Deduction Carry Forwards:** They claim these when it yields the most tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

By removing human error from the equation through automation, individuals can become far wealthier, regardless of their income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## One Major Mistake Most RRSP Millionaires Make

Despite their success in building wealth, many RRSP millionaire clients make one [[costly_misconceptions_about_rrsps | costly mistake]]: they focus solely on growing their RRSP without a clear [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | strategy for withdrawing it tax-efficiently]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

The fundamental issue is that RRSPs are tax-deferred, not tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While contributions lower current taxable income, every dollar withdrawn is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Without a plan, this can lead to:

*   Withdrawing large sums at high tax rates in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   Leaving heirs with a substantial tax bill upon the RRSP holder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Solutions and Approaches to RRSP Exit Strategy:

*   **Early Withdrawals:** Starting early withdrawals helps spread taxable income and avoid tax spikes when RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) withdrawals become mandatory after age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. This is part of [[advanced_strategies_for_managing_rrif_withdrawals | advanced strategies for managing RRIF withdrawals]].
*   **[[rrsp_to_tfsa_strategy_for_tax_savings | RRSP to TFSA Strategy]]:** Shifting funds from an RRSP to a TFSA can keep investments growing tax-free, leading to [[utilizing_tfsa_and_rrsp_for_tax_efficiency | utilizing TFSA and RRSP for tax efficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Income Coordination:** Coordinating RRSP withdrawals with other income sources like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) can help avoid higher tax brackets and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning with Life Insurance:** Life insurance policies can offset the tax burden upon death, ensuring more wealth remains with the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Many retirees unknowingly lose tens of thousands of dollars in taxes by not properly planning their RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Creating a personalized, tax-efficient withdrawal strategy is crucial for retaining more retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

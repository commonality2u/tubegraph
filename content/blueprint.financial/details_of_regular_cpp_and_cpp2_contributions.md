The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) has undergone significant changes since 2019, including the recent [[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_contribution_updates | CPP2 enhancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These changes introduce two levels of contributions with updated thresholds and rates designed to enhance retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Regular CPP Contributions (Tier 1)

Regular CPP contributions are calculated on earnings up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For 2025, the YMPE is set at $71,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

*   **Contribution Rate**: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Exemption**: A $3,500 exemption is applied before calculating pensionable earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Employer Match**: Employers match employee contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed**: Self-employed individuals pay the combined employee and employer rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Example: Mark's Regular CPP Contributions (2025)

Consider Mark, who earns $71,500 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>:
*   His pensionable earnings for regular CPP are calculated as: $71,400 (YMPE) - $3,500 (exemption) = $67,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   At a 5.95% contribution rate, Mark contributes approximately $4,033 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   His employer matches this amount, resulting in a total contribution of over $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## CPP2 Contributions (Tier 2)

CPP2 applies to earnings between the YMPE and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For 2025, the YAMPE is capped at $81,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Contribution Rate**: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Application**: This rate applies only to earnings within the YMPE and YAMPE range (e.g., $71,400 to $81,200) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **No Further Contributions**: If you earn more than the YAMPE, you do not pay any more in CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Example: James's Combined CPP Contributions (2025)

Consider James, who earns $81,300 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. His contributions include both regular CPP and CPP2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:
*   **Tier 1 (Regular CPP)**: His first tier contribution is the same as Mark's, approximately $4,030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Tier 2 (CPP2)**: For earnings between the YMPE and YAMPE (approximately $9,900 range for James), he contributes an additional 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This amounts to another $396 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Total Employee Contribution**: His total contribution is $4,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Total Combined Contribution**: With his employer's match, the total contribution will be close to $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Maximum CPP Contributions

At an income level of $81,300, both regular CPP and CPP2 contributions reach their respective caps, totaling $4,440 (employee portion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For incomes above $81,300, total contributions remain the same as there are no further contributions beyond the YAMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Purpose of Enhancements

The end goal of these CPP enhancements is to replace more of an individual's income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The income replacement rate is set to rise from the previous 25% to 33.33% (one-third) of average lifetime earnings, to be phased in over 40 years starting in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This change aims to strengthen the first pillar of Canada's retirement income system, which is based on government benefits like CPP, in response to declining employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Criticisms

While the enhancements aim to provide greater financial security, concerns exist regarding the added costs for workers, employers, and self-employed individuals, contributing to a [[perspectives_on_mandatory_cpp_contributions | debate about mandatory contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Many express financial strain due to increased contribution rates, which can impact take-home pay for employees and lead to higher payroll costs for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Self-employed individuals are particularly affected as they pay both employee and employer portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

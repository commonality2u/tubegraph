The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] is a federal benefit based on contributions made during an individual's working life in Canada, not on their residency at the time of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This means that [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP benefits]] are portable and will travel with you if you decide to retire abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The amount received remains the same, regardless of whether you live in Canada or a foreign country like Portugal, Thailand, or Costa Rica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## [[tax_implications_of_cpp | Tax Implications of CPP]] Abroad

While your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP benefits]] are portable, there are important tax considerations once you're outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Withholding Tax
[[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP payments]] may be subject to withholding tax if you are considered a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Without a tax treaty between Canada and your destination country, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP payments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Tax Treaties
If Canada has a tax treaty with the country you are moving to, the withholding tax on your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] could be reduced or even eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For instance, the tax treaty with the U.S. may allow you to avoid withholding tax entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. It is crucial to carefully review your destination's tax treaty with Canada, as these agreements vary widely and significantly impact the net amount of your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Social Security Agreements
Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. These agreements help avoid double contributions, ensure continuous [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] coverage, and coordinate benefits if you have worked in both Canada and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Local Tax Laws
While your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] amount doesn't change, your new country of residence might tax these payments differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It is advisable to check local tax laws to avoid being caught off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Other [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] Benefits Abroad
[[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP survivor benefits]] and child benefits also continue while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Receiving [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP Payments]] Abroad
You have several options for receiving your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP payments]] while abroad:
*   Direct deposit into a Canadian bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   Direct deposit in local currency to a local bank account in many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Mailed as a check in Canadian dollars if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Planning Strategies
*   **Choosing a Treaty Country**: Delaying a move or choosing a country with a social security and tax treaty with Canada, like Portugal, can help reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. For example, in Portugal, a reduced 15% withholding tax may apply to [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Drawing Down RRSPs**: Consider drawing down your Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) before becoming a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

[[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Retiring abroad]] involves significant financial changes, and understanding how your government income behaves is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] is a loyal companion that travels with you, be mindful of [[tax_implications_of_cpp | potential withholding taxes]] at your destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

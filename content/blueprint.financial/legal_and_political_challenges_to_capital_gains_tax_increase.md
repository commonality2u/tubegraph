The Canadian Finance Minister has announced a [[Deferral of Canadian capital gains tax hike | delay]] of the capital gains tax hike until January 1, 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tax, which was introduced in June 2024, aimed to raise the inclusion rate of capital gains from 50% to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. However, it is now encountering significant legal and political challenges that could lead to its complete repeal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Reasons for Uncertainty and Potential Reversal

Several factors contribute to the growing doubt about whether the capital gains tax increase will ever take effect:

### Legal Challenges
The Canadian Taxpayers Federation is pursuing legal action against the government, asserting that the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) lacks the legal authority to collect the higher tax since the legislation was never officially passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Should the court rule against the government, the tax increase could be nullified before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Political Opposition and Internal Divisions
*   **Conservative Party Stance**: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre has denounced the tax hike as a direct attack on investors, business owners, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. He argues it harms investments, slows business growth, and diminishes Canada's global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Poilievre has pledged to reverse the tax if elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Betting markets currently indicate a 95% chance of a Conservative victory in the next Canadian federal election, scheduled for October 20, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Liberal Party Internal Conflict**: Support within the Liberal Party is weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Chrystia Freeland, the former Finance Minister who originally introduced the change, has stated she would scrap it if she became Liberal leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Other leadership candidates are also distancing themselves from the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Economic Pressures
*   **US Tariff Threats**: US President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from Canada, intensifying pressure on the Canadian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. These threats could push businesses and investments away from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **High Business Costs**: Canada already faces high business costs due to corporate tax rates, regulations, and labor expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The capital gains tax increase adds an additional burden, making it more challenging for companies to expand, sell, or reinvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The government may prioritize defending Canadian industries over implementing an unpopular tax increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Arguments For and Against Reversal

There are strong arguments on both sides regarding the reversal of the capital gains tax hike:

> [!info]- Reasons Against Reversal
> *   **Revenue Loss**: The tax was projected to generate approximately $17 billion over five years to fund housing, dental care, and pharmacare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Reversing it would necessitate the government finding alternative revenue sources or reducing spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
> *   **Tax on the Wealthy**: The Liberals have framed this tax as a means to ensure wealthier Canadians contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. A rollback could be perceived as benefiting the top 1%, carrying political risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

> [!success]- Reasons For Reversal
> *   **Impact on Business Growth**: Higher capital gains taxes can discourage investments, hinder business exits, and limit reinvestment within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
> *   **US Tariff Threats**: The new tariffs from the US exacerbate the economic challenges, making an additional tax burden undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
> *   **High Business Costs**: The tax increase adds to existing high corporate tax rates, regulations, and labor costs, further impeding companies' ability to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios and Outcomes

The future of the capital gains tax is contingent on legal and political developments. Three possible outcomes are:

1.  **Full Reversal**:
    *   **Judicial Review**: If the legal challenges succeed, courts could prevent the CRA from enforcing the higher inclusion rate, effectively reversing the tax hike before the next election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   **New Government**: If Pierre Poilievre's Conservative Party wins the election and fulfills his promise, the inclusion rate would likely revert to 50% for all taxpayers, benefiting investors, business owners, and retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

2.  **Middle Ground (Partial Rollback or Temporary Freeze)**:
    *   A newly elected Poilievre government might lower the inclusion rate but not fully restore it to 50%, potentially applying different rules for corporations versus individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   A new Liberal leader distancing themselves from the tax might reduce the inclusion rate slightly, but not revert it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

3.  **No Reversal (Worst-Case Scenario)**:
    *   If the legal challenges fail, the CRA would continue collecting at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   If Poilievre wins but does not follow through on his promise due to economic pressures or other priorities, the tax would remain in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   If the Liberals surprisingly retain power, a reversal might be off the table, forcing businesses and investors to adapt to the new tax reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Estimated Probabilities
Given the widespread opposition, legal and political challenges, the new [[Deferral of Canadian capital gains tax hike | deferral]], and Trump tariffs, the following probabilities are estimated:
*   Full reversal: 80% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
*   Partial rollback: 5% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>
*   Tax remains unchanged: 15% chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

While a full reversal is highly likely, investors and business owners should prepare for all possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

*   **Stay Informed**: Monitor court rulings, political shifts, and election timelines, as any reversal will likely take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Utilize Tax-Efficient Strategies**: Protect wealth by maximizing Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), and corporate structures to reduce taxable capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This falls under [[strategies for managing increased tax liabilities | strategies for managing increased tax liabilities]].
*   **Plan for Multiple Outcomes**: If considering selling a business, assets, or real estate, evaluate whether to sell now in case the tax hike proceeds as planned next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Although the capital gains tax hike is on shaky ground due to court battles, political infighting, and a possible Poilievre victory, nothing is guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Strategic planning is crucial for investors and business owners to safeguard their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

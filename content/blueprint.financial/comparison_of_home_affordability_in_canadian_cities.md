The [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | Canadian housing market]] has become a significant hurdle for many first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. With home prices [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | skyrocketing]], particularly in major cities, owning a home can feel increasingly out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Housing Market Challenges

In cities like Toronto and Vancouver, home prices have soared, making it difficult for individuals to save enough for a substantial down payment, let alone afford the ongoing mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Even in more affordable areas, a rapid rise in prices is compelling buyers to accumulate larger down payments to compete effectively in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Down Payment Impact by Region

A $200,000 down payment, achievable by combining savings tools like the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) Home Buyers' Plan (HBP), demonstrates varying impacts depending on the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

| City           | Impact of $200,000 Down Payment |
| :------------- | :------------------------------ |
| Montreal       | Covers approximately 32% of the total home cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a> |
| Calgary        | Covers approximately 32% of the total home cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a> |
| Toronto        | Covers only about 16-19% of the total home cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> |
| Vancouver      | Covers only about 16-19% of the total home cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> |

### Implications for Buyers

*   **Higher-priced markets (e.g., Toronto, Vancouver):** Buyers will need to take on significantly larger mortgages to cover the remaining cost, as a $200,000 down payment makes up a smaller percentage of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **More affordable cities (e.g., Montreal, Calgary):** A larger down payment can make it substantially easier to enter the market and potentially secure more favorable mortgage terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

## The Role of Tax-Free Savings Tools

It is crucial for buyers to utilize tax-free savings tools like the FHSA and the Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. For those in more expensive cities, every bit of savings helps to reduce the larger mortgage burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

A real estate agent noted that once couples understand how to combine the FHSA and RSP, they realize that home ownership can become achievable much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This strategic financial planning transforms what once seemed impossible into a genuine opportunity to own a home in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

The tax advantages of accounts like the FHSA and RSP can significantly impact the amount needed to save for a $200,000 down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. For example, to save $200,000 without these tax-free accounts, an individual with a 30% tax rate would need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 remaining after taxes, which is an additional $85,000 to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. However, using these tax-deductible accounts allows individuals to save the full $200,000 without paying taxes on that income, drastically reducing the overall amount needed to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

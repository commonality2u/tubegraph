Reviewing and optimizing investments is a critical step in managing personal finances, particularly at the start of a new year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This process helps refine investment strategy, maximize growth, and minimize tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Reviewing Investment Performance

Reviewing the previous year's portfolio is essential for refining your strategy for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Investments are influenced by market conditions, economic trends, and geopolitical events, making reflection on successes and setbacks crucial for making better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Understanding what worked and what didn't prepares investors to make more resilient decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### How to Review

1.  **Review Performance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>:
    *   Assess how each investment has performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   Examine underperforming sectors to determine if losses stemmed from trends or specific holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   If you had a strong year, consider what drove that success, such as diversification, strong stock picks, or favorable markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   If you experienced losses, analyze the causes, such as overexposure to a certain sector, emotional reactions to dips, or insufficient diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
2.  **Assess Allocation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
    *   Check if your portfolio reflects your goals and [[portfolio_management_and_risk_assessment | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   Determine if it's too equity-heavy or overly conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Spot Cognitive Biases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
    *   Avoid pitfalls like recency bias (overweighting recent trends) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Avoid loss aversion (focusing too much on avoiding losses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Pro Tip

Focus on your long-term goals when reviewing investments to avoid reacting emotionally to short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Additional Actions

*   **Rebalance Your Portfolio** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>: If your portfolio is overweighted in one sector, rebalance it at the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Identify Opportunities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>: Explore sectors with long-term growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Document Your Strategy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>: Write a clear plan, including when to rebalance and how to manage volatility, to stay focused and disciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Optimizing Investment Accounts

Optimizing investments also involves prioritizing contributions to tax-advantaged accounts. Tax-advantaged accounts like TFSAs, FHSAs, and RRSPs offer unmatched tax savings and compounding growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Contributing early in the year gives investments more time to grow, helping to build wealth for specific goals or retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Account Prioritization

*   **TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:
    *   Aim to max out the annual contribution room (e.g., $7,000 for 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
    *   Offers tax-free growth, making it a powerful wealth-building tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **FHSA (First Home Savings Account)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:
    *   Ideal for first-time home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   Offers tax deductions similar to an RRSP and tax-free withdrawals for a home purchase, like a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>:
    *   Review whether to contribute for the previous year or wait for the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
    *   Perfect for high-income earners who expect a lower tax bracket in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Be mindful of contribution limits and deadlines (e.g., March 3rd for the previous year's contributions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>:
    *   If you have children, contribute regularly to maximize government grants (up to $500 annually per child) and tax-sheltered growth for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Prioritization Rule of Thumb

*   **High-income earners**: Consider prioritizing RRSP contributions for tax breaks, especially if your employer offers matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Moderate or low-income earners**: Focus on the TFSA for its flexibility and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Saving for a home**: Utilize the FHSA for its unique tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Automating Contributions

Automating contributions ensures consistent progress by removing the need for constant decision-making, reducing procrastination and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

*   **Savings**: Set automatic transfers to a high-interest savings account or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Investments**: Use pre-authorized contributions for RRSPs, FHSAs, or other accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Optimizing Retirement Income

For retirees or those nearing retirement, reviewing retirement income and benefits is crucial. Managing income sources, taxes, and benefits ensures savings last and helps sustain lifestyle without overpaying taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

*   **CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security)**:
    *   Consider optimizing timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Delaying CPP to age 70 increases payments by 42% for the rest of your life, providing more stable income later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
    *   Avoid OAS clawbacks if income exceeds the threshold (e.g., almost $91,000 for 2024) by deferring OAS or adjusting income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Pension Splitting**:
    *   Split eligible pension income with a lower-income spouse to reduce household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   Transferring $20,000 can lower tax brackets for both partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund) Withdrawals**:
    *   Withdraw strategically to avoid higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    *   Transfer excess withdrawals into a TFSA to further shelter growth from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Government Credits and Benefits**:
    *   Claim the age credit and pension credit if eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Utilize the home accessibility tax credit for renovations improving home safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Pro Tip

Stress test your plan for scenarios like market downturns or unexpected medical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. For example, check if your portfolio can handle a 20% drop or an extra $10,000 in annual expenses for healthcare or travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Proactive planning ensures maximization of income, minimization of taxes, and maintenance of [[strategies_for_wealth_optimization | financial peace of mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

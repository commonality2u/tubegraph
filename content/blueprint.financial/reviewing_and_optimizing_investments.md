Regularly reviewing your [[monitoring_and_managing_investment_performance | investment performance]] is crucial for refining your financial [[investment_strategies_and_account_optimization | strategy]] and ensuring your portfolio aligns with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Investments are influenced by market conditions, economic trends, and geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, making reflection on both successes and setbacks essential for making better decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Why Review Your Investments?

Reviewing your portfolio helps you understand what contributed to its performance in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
*   **For strong performance:** If you experienced a strong year, like a 30% return on investments, identify what drove that success. Was it diversification, strong stock picks, or favorable market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>?
*   **For losses:** If you incurred losses, analyze the causes. This could include overexposure to a certain sector, reacting emotionally to market dips, or insufficient diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Understanding what worked and what didn't prepares you to make more resilient [[investment_strategies_and_account_optimization | investment decisions]] for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## How to Review and Optimize

### Step 1: Review Performance
Assess how each investment has performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. Examine underperforming sectors to determine if losses resulted from broader trends or specific holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Step 2: Assess Allocation
Check if your portfolio's allocation reflects your goals and [[understanding_risk_tolerance_and_investment_choices | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Determine if it is too equity-heavy or overly conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### Step 3: Spot Cognitive Biases
Be aware of common pitfalls that can affect [[investment_strategies_and_account_optimization | investment choices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>:
*   **Recency bias:** Overweighting recent market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Loss aversion:** Focusing too much on avoiding losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Focus on Long-Term Goals
When reviewing investments, concentrate on your long-term objectives to avoid emotional reactions to short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Additional Optimization Actions
*   **Rebalance your portfolio:** If your portfolio has become overweighted in one sector due to market performance, rebalance it at the beginning of the year to realign with your target asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Identify opportunities:** Explore sectors with long-term growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   **Document your strategy:** Write a clear plan for the upcoming year, including when to rebalance and how to manage volatility, to stay focused and disciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

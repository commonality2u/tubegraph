Mutual funds hold a significant presence in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This figure is nearly five times greater than the $429 billion invested in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating that mutual funds remain considerably more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## What is a Mutual Fund?

When discussing mutual funds in this context, the focus is specifically on high-cost, actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from many investors to acquire a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Professional portfolio managers or teams typically oversee these funds, making strategic decisions to buy and sell assets with the aim of outperforming a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, Canadian mutual funds often fail to achieve this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Why Mutual Funds Remain Popular

Despite several drawbacks, mutual funds in Canada maintain their popularity due to aggressive distribution channels and perceived benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>:

### Easy Access and Convenience
Mutual funds are highly accessible and convenient for the average investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. They provide a straightforward way to diversify across various asset classes without requiring extensive market knowledge or large amounts of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. With banks readily available across Canada, financial advisors often promote mutual funds due to aggressive sales targets, leading many Canadians to invest in them over more cost-effective options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Mutual funds are also high-profit products for banks, which incentivizes their promotion to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Perceived Professional Expertise
Many investors are drawn to mutual funds because they are managed by professional portfolio managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. These managers are seen as experts capable of making informed investment decisions, appealing to those who prefer a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. People often believe in the expertise of these fund managers, hoping for high returns, a narrative skillfully painted by financial advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The marketing and the established trust and reputation of large financial institutions further convince investors to choose mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Misleading Marketing Tactics
Marketing techniques, such as Morningstar's five-star ratings, can mislead investors into believing they will achieve better performance with certain funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. However, many studies indicate that these five-star funds tend to underperform in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Hidden Downsides of Mutual Funds

Despite their popularity, mutual funds in Canada have significant drawbacks:

### [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | High Fees Associated with Canadian Mutual Funds]]
Canadian mutual fund fees are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The average asset-weighted management expense ratio (MER) for equity funds in Canada is around 1.76%, for allocation funds it's approximately 1.9%, and for fixed-income funds, it's 0.89%, as per Morningstar's 2022 report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Many equity fund MERs, particularly from large banks, can exceed 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

This seemingly small percentage can drastically reduce investment returns over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For example, a $100,000 investment earning 7% annually would grow to approximately $387,000 over 20 years without fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, with a 2% annual fee (resulting in a 5% actual return), the investment would only reach $265,000â€”a difference of $122,000, or nearly a third of potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Over 30 years, the difference becomes even more pronounced: $761,000 without fees versus $432,000 with a 2% fee, a staggering $329,000 difference (43% of potential returns lost to fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This impact is largely due to the power of compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

While mutual fund fees in Canada have seen slight decreases in recent years due to fee-based advice and regulatory changes like client-focused reforms, they remain a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Low Returns and Underperformance
A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada underperform their respective benchmarks across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For instance, over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed the S&P/TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The S&P/TSX Composite Index gained an annualized return of 7.62% over that decade, while Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This difference closely mirrors the average 2% fees charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

This underperformance extends across categories:
*   98% of Canadian-focused Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   88.6% of Canadian Dividend and Income Equity Funds fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   76.19% of Canadian small- to mid-cap equity funds underperformed their benchmark over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This consistent underperformance highlights a systemic issue within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Deceptive Marketing and Survivorship Bias
Banks and financial institutions often highlight only the success stories among mutual funds, showcasing top-performing funds while omitting underperforming ones that were closed or merged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This selective reporting creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

This phenomenon is known as survivorship bias, where performance reports only consider surviving funds, excluding poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This creates a misleadingly positive picture of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

*   Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   On average, across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   Specifically, only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived, and for Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### [[tax_inefficiency_of_mutual_funds_in_canada | Tax Inefficiency Concerns]]
Mutual funds can be tax inefficient, particularly when held in non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>:

*   **Capital Gains Distribution**: Mutual funds must distribute realized capital gains to investors annually, meaning investors can pay taxes on gains even if they haven't sold any shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed funds often trade frequently, leading to short-term capital gains taxed at higher rates (regular income tax rates) than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control Over Tax Timing**: Investors are subject to the fund manager's decisions on realizing gains or losses, which can result in taxable events at inconvenient times, increasing tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

To avoid these [[tax_inefficiency_of_mutual_funds_in_canada | tax inefficiencies]], investing in a [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] (Tax-Free Savings Account) is an option, as it eliminates concerns about tax implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Alternatives to Mutual Funds
Given these downsides, several alternatives to mutual funds in Canada offer potentially better value:

*   **Robo-advisors**: Offer convenient, cost-effective investing with lower fees than traditional mutual funds, typically about half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Examples include Questwealth and Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Hiring a Portfolio Manager**: Can be more cost-effective than mutual funds, offering personalized investment strategies tailored to goals and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Building Your Own ETF Portfolios**: Offers greater flexibility, lower fees, and better tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The trend is shifting, with ETFs experiencing net sales of $4.4 billion in May 2024, compared to mutual funds' net redemptions of $1.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Do-It-Yourself Stock Portfolio**: The most hands-on and potentially rewarding alternative, allowing direct control, fee minimization, and portfolio tailoring, though it requires significant knowledge, research, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

Despite their continued popularity, the high fees and consistent underperformance of mutual funds can significantly impact long-term returns and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

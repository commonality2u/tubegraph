Nearly 40% of new Canadians are considering leaving their province or even the country, primarily due to skyrocketing living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the dream of waking up to a sunrise in Portugal or a sunset in Thailand is appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, a solid financial plan is crucial before packing your bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Prioritizing What Matters

As Voltaire famously said, "Perfect is the enemy of good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. No country is perfect, so the decision to move abroad hinges on what truly matters to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It's recommended to select your top three to five factors and priorities to evaluate any country you are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Top Seven Factors to Consider

Based on common considerations for moving abroad, here are key factors to evaluate:

1.  **Healthcare**
    It's important to know you'll have access to good doctors and hospitals nearby, and that your health insurance will provide adequate coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

2.  **Cost of Living**
    Understanding what you'll spend on housing, groceries, and daily living expenses is essential to avoid financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

3.  **Safety**
    Feeling safe is key, so research crime rates, political stability, and potential natural disaster concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This aligns with [[safety_and_cultural_considerations_for_canadians_moving_internationally | safety and cultural considerations for Canadians moving internationally]].

4.  **Job Market**
    Whether you're actively job hunting or planning to work remotely, knowing the local job market is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

5.  **Visa and Citizenship**
    Consider how easy it is to obtain and maintain a visa in the country you're considering. For long-term plans, research the citizenship process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This directly relates to [[visa_options_for_canadians_moving_abroad | Visa options for Canadians moving abroad]].

6.  **Taxes**
    Investigate what you'll owe on income and property in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This is a significant part of [[tax_considerations_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax considerations for Canadian retirees abroad]].

7.  **Weather**
    For Canadians, the climate is often a huge deal, with many seeking sunnier and warmer places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Other factors beyond these seven can also be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Example: Homer's Approach

To illustrate, consider Homer, who chose healthcare, cost of living, and safety as his top factors for moving abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. After research, he is looking at Spain, Portugal, and New Zealand because they offer good healthcare, lower costs than Canada, and strong safety records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Conversely, he is avoiding Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico due to inconsistent healthcare, varying living costs, and safety concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Understanding Logistics When Moving Abroad

Beyond personal preferences, it's crucial to understand the logistics of moving abroad. This includes topics like tax treaties, departure tax from Canada, and how your accounts will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. These are key elements of [[effects_of_relocating_on_canadian_retirement_savings_and_benefits | effects of relocating on Canadian retirement savings and benefits]].

## Finding Balance

Choosing the best place to move involves balancing strategic planning with personal comfort, acknowledging that compromises are part of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. There is no single "perfect" country, and what matters most is understanding your priorities in a new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If you are seriously considering moving abroad, having a solid financial plan that addresses logistics from tax treaties to asset management and departure taxes is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

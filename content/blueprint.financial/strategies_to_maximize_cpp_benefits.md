Many Canadians do not receive anywhere near the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefit of around $2,000 per month, even after decades of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The average payment for those starting at age 60 is approximately $530 per month, a 74% drop from the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. To get as close to the maximum $2,034 per month as possible, it's crucial to understand the [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | three biggest factors affecting your payout]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Factor 1: Earning a High Salary Doesn't Guarantee a Max CPP

To receive the maximum CPP payout, your salary and income must be high enough to meet the maximum contribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, what counts as "maximum" has changed over time, particularly with the introduction of CPP2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### The Second Earning Ceiling (YMPE)

Starting in 2024, CPP introduced a second earning ceiling, meaning higher-income earners contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In 2024, this new second ceiling, called YMPE, is $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This is the amount you need to earn annually to receive maximum CPP payments when you retire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The maximum threshold has steadily increased, making it harder to reach maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example:
*   In 1990, you needed to earn $28,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   In 2000, it was $37,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   In 2010, it was $47,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

What qualified as a high enough salary to max out CPP in the past is insufficient today, and it will continue to rise, requiring younger Canadians to earn even higher salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] James's Payout
> James earned at least the maximum YMPE every year for nearly four decades and decided to start collecting CPP at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Despite this, he receives around $917 per month, which is less than half of the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This illustrates that even with a very high income, you might not get anywhere near the maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Factor 2: Delaying CPP – Why Timing Matters

One of the biggest [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | factors in determining your CPP payout]] is when you start collecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The longer you wait, the higher your monthly payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Here's how CPP payments change based on when you start:
*   **Age 60:** Average monthly payment is $540, with a maximum possible amount of $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Age 65:** Average jumps to $838, with a maximum of $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Age 70:** Delaying until age 70 boosts your pay by 42% compared to taking it at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Conversely, starting CPP at 60 reduces your payments by around 36%, and this reduction lasts for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Despite the significant financial benefits of waiting, less than 2% of Canadians actually delay CPP until 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Inflation Indexing
> CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning your payments will continue to rise over time to keep up with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In recent years, CPP payouts have increased significantly due to higher inflation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Delaying OAS
> Consider [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | delaying Old Age Security (OAS)]] alongside CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. OAS also increases by 0.6% per month after age 65, which can significantly impact your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

While delaying CPP offers benefits, it's not for everyone. Many [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | factors]] must be considered, such as your life expectancy, financial situation, and income needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Factor 3: Contribution Gaps – Why Even High Earners Can Fall Short

Even if you earn a high salary and delay CPP to age 70, you still might not receive the full $2,034 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This is because CPP is based on your lifetime contributions, not just your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. To get the maximum CPP payout, you need to have at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Many people fall short due to gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Common reasons for contribution gaps include:
*   **Career Breaks:** Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care can result in years with no CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership:** If you were self-employed and paid lower or inconsistent CPP contributions, this can lower your lifetime average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment:** Missing a few years of contributions due to unemployment can drag down your average, even if you later had a very high salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry:** If you retire before 65 or started working late, you might not accumulate the full 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Jerry and Elaine
> Elaine received the full $2,034 per month at age 70 because she had 39 years of maximum contributions with no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Jerry, who also delayed CPP to 70, ended up with less than $1,500 because he had many contribution gaps, perhaps due to time off for starting a business, going back to school, or unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Even though he maxed out his salary in working years, those missing years pulled his average down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### How Contribution Gaps Affect Your Final CPP Pay

CPP uses your best 39 years of contributions to calculate your retirement benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To help, CPP includes a general Dropout provision, allowing you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Given 47 years of potential contributions from ages 18 to 65, this means you could drop about 8 years of low or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you delay CPP to 70, your total working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains roughly 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

While this provision reduces the impact of short gaps, if you miss more than 8 years of contributions, your final payout will be lower, even with a high salary and delayed CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This is precisely what happened to Jerry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_payouts | How to Maximize Your CPP Benefits]]

Think of CPP as a three-legged stool: your payout depends on salary, timing, and consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. To achieve the maximum CPP payout, you need to optimize all three factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### 1. Delay CPP as Late as Possible

The biggest boost comes from delaying CPP, which is the easiest way to increase your payout as it doesn't require earning more or changing your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Delaying past age 65: Your CPP increases by 8.4% per year, up to a 42% boost at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   Starting before age 65: Your CPP decreases by 7.2% per year, up to a 36% reduction at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Financial Planning
> It's crucial to plan to have other income sources, such as investments, TFSAs, and RRSPs, to cover expenses while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### 2. Earn at Least the YMPE for as Many Years as Possible

This is often the hardest factor, as increasing income requires effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. However, increasing your income over time directly increases your CPP payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Negotiate higher wages and promotions:** The more you earn, the more you can contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Start a side hustle or business:** If self-employed, ensure you pay into CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Level up your skills:** Invest in certifications, training, or new skills that can lead to a higher-paying job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Switch jobs strategically:** Changing employers can often result in faster salary growth than staying in the same position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

### 3. Avoid Contribution Gaps and Maximize Your Contribution Years

Even with delayed CPP and a high salary, too many missing years will prevent you from receiving the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Work for at least 39 years:** Aim for strong contributions during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Utilize dropout provisions:** CPP allows you to drop up to 8 years of low or no contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. However, missing more than that will lower your payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Use the child rearing provision:** Exclude low-income years if you took time off to raise children under seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

[[cpp_payment_strategies_and_optimization | Maximizing your CPP]] isn't just about earning more; it's about making smart decisions regarding your contributions and timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The right [[strategies_to_supplement_cpp_and_oas_income | strategy]] can mean hundreds more per month in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

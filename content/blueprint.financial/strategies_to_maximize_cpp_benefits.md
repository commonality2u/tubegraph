The majority of Canadians are not maximizing their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, with the average Canadian receiving 40% less than the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article will explore the factors influencing CPP payouts and provide [[strategies_for_maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | strategies to help you get closer to the maximum amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Average vs. Maximum CPP Payouts (2024)

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, with payouts varying significantly based on the age you begin receiving your pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

| Age to Start Pension | Maximum Monthly Amount | Average Monthly Amount | Difference |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------- |
| 60                   | $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>           | $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>           | 40.21% less |
| 65 (Standard)        | $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>     | $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>     | 40.16% less |
| 70                   | $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>     | $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>      | 40.16% less |

## [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | Key Factors Determining Your CPP Payouts]]

The amount of CPP you receive is primarily influenced by two major factors:

### Contributions
Your CPP retirement pension benefits are heavily dependent on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To receive the maximum benefit, you typically need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The more you contribute and the longer your contribution period, the higher your pension will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Average Earnings
Your average earnings over your career also directly affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Consistently high annual earnings at or above the YMPE will maximize your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Conversely, years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

#### Example: David and Sarah
David and Sarah are both 65 and receiving CPP, but with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>:

*   **Sarah:** Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a long contribution period and consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. She receives the maximum payout of $1,364 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **David:** Had gaps in employment, started contributing later, and had many years of much lower earnings, resulting in fewer years of contribution and reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He receives the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

In essence, the more you earn and contribute to CPP from your paycheck, the higher your eventual CPP benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize Your CPP Payments

Here are ways to potentially move from below-average or average CPP payments to the maximum:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working while receiving CPP up to age 70, you can still contribute to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. These additional contributions will earn you a Post-Retirement Benefit, increasing your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For example, Sarah, at 67, still works part-time and contributes, boosting her monthly CPP payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 2. Utilize Drop-Out Provisions
The CPP allows for provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings, which can result in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **General Drop-Out Provision**: You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals around 8 years if you contributed for 47 years (from age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Child Rearing Drop-Out**: If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years from your CPP calculation, which can increase your benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Disability Provisions**: Periods of disability can also adjust your lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### 3. Maximize Your Earnings and Contributions
This is a challenging but effective way to increase your CPP. Aim to ensure your annual income meets or exceeds the YMPE (e.g., $68,500 for 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher contributions directly translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. For example, Alex started a successful online business, which helped him exceed the YMPE and increase his CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher paying positions throughout your career, as more earnings mean more contributions to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Longevity in Contributions**: Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Your CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings will result in higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## [[estimating_cpp_benefits | Estimating Your CPP Benefits]]

To determine if you're on track to hit your target CPP benefits, you can use these estimation methods:

### 1. Rule of Thumb
The CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Previously, it replaced 25% of average work earnings, but with the new enhancement, it can now replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

> For example, if your average annual earnings were $40,000:
> *   **Before Enhancement**: CPP would replace 25%, providing about $10,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
> *   **After Enhancement**: CPP now replaces about one-third, providing $13,332 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
This method is best used as a ballpark estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### 2. Online Calculators
For a more tailored estimate, you can use online calculators:
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator**: This comprehensive tool provides a very detailed estimate of your future CPP payment but can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Ativa's Calculator**: A quicker and easier-to-use option, though its accuracy may decrease the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 3. Statement of Contributions
This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Online**: Access it via your My Service Canada account. Sign in (e.g., through your bank), select "CPP OAS," and scroll to the contribution section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **By Phone**: You can call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Distinction: Delaying CPP Payments

While delaying your CPP start age significantly increases your payout, it does *not* inherently boost you from an average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The strategies mentioned earlier (contributions, earnings, drop-outs) are what bridge the gap to the maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Deciding when to start CPP is a separate financial consideration, which is covered in more detail in other discussions on [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_payments | the benefits of delaying CPP payments]] and [[advantages_of_delaying_cpp_benefits | advantages of delaying CPP benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

It's a misconception that starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. For most clients, it's generally better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you're not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

If you're still wondering if you're getting the most out of your CPP, financial professionals can guide you in optimizing your payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is a monthly payment available to most Canadians aged 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While these payments can reach up to $948 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, the entire amount can be clawed back by the government if your income exceeds certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This reduction is formally known as the OAS recovery tax, or the "OAS clawback" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## How the OAS Clawback Works

The [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | OAS clawback]] is triggered when your net income exceeds a specific threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The clawback amount is calculated as a 15% recovery tax on every dollar of income above this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

There are also specific income levels at which the entire OAS benefit is eliminated:
*   If your income reaches or exceeds $148,179 for those under age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   If your income reaches or exceeds $153,700 for those age 75 and over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. (Note: The transcript states $153,700 "per month" which is likely a transcription error given the annual context provided immediately after).

### Example: David's OAS Clawback

Consider David, a 75-year-old collecting OAS in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. If his income hits $160,000, which is well over the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, he will lose all of his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The 15% recovery tax on the amount over the $90,997 threshold would add up to $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Since David's annual OAS benefit is below that at $9,481, he would receive nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce or Avoid OAS Clawback

By understanding and implementing specific [[investment_strategies_for_minimizing_oas_clawback | investment strategies for minimizing OAS clawback]] and tax planning, retirees can potentially save over $9,000 a year by reducing or avoiding the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Here are seven ways to achieve this:

### 1. Delay Your CPP Payments

Delaying your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments until a later age (e.g., 68, 69, or 70) is an effective strategy to reduce the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This approach offers a dual benefit:
*   **Increased CPP Payments**: Your CPP payments can increase by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For instance, if you're eligible for $1,000 per month at age 65, delaying until age 70 could increase it to $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These higher payments are also indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Lower Taxable Income**: It lowers your taxable income between ages 65 and 70, a period when the OAS clawback often begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

#### Example: Peter Parker's CPP Delay
Peter Parker, age 65, faces an OAS clawback of $8,111 due to high taxable income from drawing both CPP and other retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By delaying his CPP, his taxable income is reduced, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $5,841 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This represents a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. Delay Your OAS Payments

Similar to CPP, delaying your OAS payments up to age 70 can be a smart strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This increases your monthly OAS payments by 36%, giving you more income later while potentially reducing or eliminating the clawback in earlier retirement years when income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. For example, delaying a $500 monthly OAS payment from age 65 to age 70 increases it to $680 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

#### Example: Peter Parker's OAS Delay
Peter faces an $8,111 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. By delaying OAS until age 70, the entire clawback is eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This strategy helps avoid losing benefits when income is high and secures a higher monthly OAS payment (36% increase) after age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Important Note**: Delaying CPP and OAS is not always the best option. Factors like health issues or a shorter life expectancy might make it less beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Personal circumstances require specific planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### 3. Use Your TFSA Wisely

A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is an excellent tool to help [[using_tfsa_to_reduce_taxable_income_and_prevent_oas_clawback | avoid the OAS clawback]] because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This means you can access funds for living expenses without increasing your taxable income, helping you stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

#### Example: TFSA for Living Expenses
If you have $100,000 in your TFSA and withdraw $20,000 per year for living expenses, this amount is not taxed and does not count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In contrast, withdrawing the same $20,000 from a taxable account like an RRSP could push your income over the threshold, triggering the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The TFSA offers crucial flexibility for tax-free income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip: RRSP to TFSA Ladder**: Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing it to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This keeps your taxable income lower later on and allows tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement, minimizing the clawback effect on your OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting

Pension income splitting can significantly reduce your household's taxable income and help avoid the OAS clawback, especially if one spouse earns much less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This strategy allows you to transfer up to 50% of eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

#### Example: Peter and Mary Jane
Peter Parker earns $60,000 annually from his pension, while his wife Mary Jane earns a lower amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. By splitting income, Peter can transfer $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000, putting him in a lower tax bracket and reducing the risk of the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Mary Jane, being in a lower tax bracket, pays less tax on the transferred income, leading to a lower overall tax burden for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Crucially, this helps keep Peter's income below the OAS clawback threshold of $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### 5. Manage Your RRIF Withdrawals

When you turn 71, your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) converts to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), requiring minimum annual withdrawals that are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These withdrawals can push your income over the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

One clever way to minimize this impact and help with [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks_with_rrif_withdrawals | avoiding OAS clawbacks with RRIF withdrawals]] is to use your younger spouse's age to reduce the withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

#### Example: Peter and Mary Jane's RRIF Strategy
If Peter is 71 and Mary Jane is 65, they can base Peter's RRIF withdrawals on Mary Jane's younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Normally, Peter would need to withdraw 5.28% from his RRIF at age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, by basing it on Mary Jane's age, the rate drops to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For a $200,000 RRIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering their taxable income by $2,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This reduction helps them stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### 6. Invest Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts

The type of income you earn from non-registered accounts can significantly increase your taxable income and trigger the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Interest income** (from bonds, GICs, savings accounts) is fully taxable at your marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Capital gains** are only taxed at 50% of your marginal tax rate, making them a more tax-efficient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

By focusing on growth [[investment_strategies_for_minimizing_oas_clawback | investments]] like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, you can reduce your taxable income and stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. For instance, $10,000 in interest income is fully taxed, but $10,000 in capital gains only results in $5,000 being taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Being mindful of how different income types count towards your taxable income is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### 7. Capture Capital Gains Before Age 65

Timing is crucial for managing capital gains to avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. By capturing capital gains before you turn 65, you can avoid large taxable events once OAS benefits begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While capital gains are taxed favorably (50% inclusion rate), large gains can still push you over the clawback threshold in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

A smart approach is to realize these gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This allows you to pay taxes earlier and avoid increasing your taxable income during the crucial years when OAS begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. For example, selling a property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain won't count towards your taxable income when OAS starts, saving thousands in reduced benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Effective [[pension_and_retiree_tax_updates_including_cpp_and_oas | retirement planning]] involves understanding how strategies like delaying CPP and OAS, using your TFSA, and managing RRIF withdrawals can help you avoid the OAS clawback and retain more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. These smart moves can potentially save retirees tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. For complex cases, such as those with retirement properties or businesses, professional guidance is often beneficial to navigate these tax strategies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

Accurately reporting all income is crucial for maintaining compliance with tax authorities and avoiding significant penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) actively cross-references your tax return with various income records, including T4s and T5s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Consequences of Underreporting Income

Forgetting to report income sources can lead to severe consequences, including penalties and potential tax audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This is considered one of the [[common_tax_filing_mistakes_to_avoid | common tax filing mistakes to avoid]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

### Types of Income to Report

It is vital to report all forms of income, which may include:
*   Employment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Side hustle earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Investment dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

Platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now directly report income to the CRA, meaning unreported earnings can trigger automatic reassessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Penalties for Unreported Income

If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return, and you've also missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a penalty of 10% of the unreported amount (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. To avoid these costly penalties, all income sources must be accurately reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

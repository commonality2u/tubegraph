## Payment Dates in 2025

The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) in 2025, meaning recipients will receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. These dates typically fall in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a scheduled payment date occurs on a weekend or holiday, the payment will be issued slightly earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

For enhanced convenience and security, it is recommended to set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account. This ensures payments arrive in your account promptly and offers a more reliable alternative to waiting for mail checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

[[inflation_considerations_regarding_cpp | CPP payments are subject to an annual increase to align with inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For 2025, the adjustment is set at 2.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This means if you were receiving $1,000 per month in CPP in 2024, your 2025 monthly payment will rise by 2.6% ($26), resulting in a new monthly payment of $1,026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. While this adjustment helps retirees maintain their purchasing power as costs rise, it is noted as a relatively small increase for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## [[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_implications_for_payroll | Two-Tier CPP System (CPP Enhancement)]]

The CPP enhancement, also known as the two-tier CPP system, means that higher earners will contribute more to their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

This system is structured as follows:

*   **Tier 1: Base CPP (BCPP)**
    *   Applies to earnings up to $71,500, which is known as the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Employees contribute 5.95% of their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Employers match this contribution at 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   Self-employed individuals contribute the combined rate of 11.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Tier 2: Enhanced CPP (CPP2)**
    *   Applies to earnings between $71,300 and $81,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Both employees and employers contribute 4% on earnings within this range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Self-employed individuals contribute 8% for this tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

CPP contributions are capped at $4,420 for incomes exceeding $81,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Contribution Examples by Income Level (2025)

The following table illustrates total CPP contributions at various income levels, factoring in the $3,500 income exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>:

| Income Level   | Total CPP Contribution (Employee) | CPP2 Contribution (included) |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| $40,000        | $2,171                            | N/A (does not reach Tier 2)  |
| $80,000        | $4,388                            | $348                         |
| $100,000       | $4,420                            | N/A (capped at maximum)      |

The maximum CPP contribution for 2025 is $4,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

This enhanced system is designed to help higher earners accumulate more for retirement, with CPP potentially replacing up to 33.33% of lifetime earnings, an increase from the previous 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It can be viewed as an upgrade, where contributing more now leads to better payouts in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

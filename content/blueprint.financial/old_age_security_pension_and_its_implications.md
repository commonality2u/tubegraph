Many Canadians believe that the [[reliability_of_cpp_and_oas_for_retirement_in_canada | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, for many retirees who rely heavily on these benefits, life can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down what you can expect from OAS and how it impacts retirement living.

## What is Old Age Security (OAS)?

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a universal benefit for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Unlike the [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]], OAS is not based on employment income or work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Eligibility Criteria
To qualify for OAS, you must be:
*   A Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   Aged 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   Have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and whether you choose to defer payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### OAS Payment Amounts
As of March 2025, the maximum monthly OAS payments are:
*   **Ages 65 to 74**: Approximately $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
*   **Age 75 and older**: This amount automatically increases by 10% to approximately $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, and October) and adjusted based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
If your total income is very low, you may qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This government benefit is designed to help very low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

*   The maximum GIS for 2024 is $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   GIS is reduced dollar for dollar if you have any additional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Even small withdrawals from RRSPs can impact eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   Notably, OAS itself does not count towards the GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Total Estimated Income with OAS and GIS
For a retiree with no other income sources, a potential monthly income combining [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP]], OAS, and GIS might look like this:
*   CPP: ~$800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
*   OAS: ~$700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>
*   GIS: ~$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>
*   **Total**: ~$2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>

However, this total income is barely above the poverty line, making reliance solely on [[reliability_of_cpp_and_oas_for_retirement_in_canada | CPP]], OAS, and GIS a challenging and not very comfortable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Implications for Retirement Living
Living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada requires serious sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

### Major Expenses
*   **Housing**: The largest cost. If you own your home outright, costs are lower but still include property taxes, maintenance, and utilities (~$500+ per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Renting, even in smaller cities, can cost a minimum of $1,000 per month, potentially wiping out half of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. Major cities like Toronto or Vancouver have rents exceeding $2,000 per month for a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: A basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300-$500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Eating out is generally not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be major expenses, especially if private insurance is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: Electricity, heating, internet, and phone are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Car ownership adds $200-$500 per month, while public transit can be at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations
On such an income, there's typically:
*   No travel budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   No budget for big purchases like furniture or a new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>.
*   Little to no emergency fund, meaning unexpected bills can derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. This often necessitates reliance on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

This constitutes a barebones lifestyle, making it difficult to enjoy golden years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

## When Relying on OAS Alone Might Work (or Not)
Living solely on [[reliability_of_cpp_and_oas_for_retirement_in_canada | CPP]] and OAS is challenging, but it might be possible in specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

### Scenarios Where it Could Work
*   **Homeownership (outright)**: No mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Homeowners can also borrow against their home or downsize to free up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Low-cost living area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **Shared housing costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   **Extra support**: Help from family, investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

For instance, a mortgage-free retiree in a small town in Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.

### When it Falls Apart
For most retirees, living on [[reliability_of_cpp_and_oas_for_retirement_in_canada | CPP]] and OAS alone is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
*   **Major city costs**: High costs of living in major cities make it very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Unexpected expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.
*   **No savings**: Without emergency funds, every month becomes a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement worrying about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Supplement OAS
If OAS and [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP]] won't cover your expenses, several strategies can help bridge the gap:
*   **Delay OAS Payments**: OAS payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70, with a 36% increase by delaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This strategy relates to [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | the benefits and drawbacks of delaying CPP and OAS payments]].
*   **Part-time Work or Delay Retirement**: Working part-time or delaying full retirement can ensure money lasts longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**: Downsizing your home or relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or abroad can make your money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.
*   **Government Benefits**: Explore other programs like the Allowance for the Survivor for additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Planning**: Strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal can lower your tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

### Creative Retirement Approaches
Some retirees use innovative methods to manage limited income:
*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming house sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Hobbies into Income**: Monetizing skills by teaching music, selling crafts, tutoring, or becoming local tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Using programs like Trusted Housesitters to live for free by house sitting globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend of slow traveling through low-cost countries, utilizing extended tourist visas, and living for months in places where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. For example, some retirees live on $1,500 a month in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

For Canadians considering living outside the country, it's important to understand what happens to [[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP]] and OAS when you leave Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal can offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access might be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Most retirees pursuing this are in their 60s or early 70s, active and healthy enough to embrace the lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Planning
If you're relying solely on [[reliability_of_cpp_and_oas_for_retirement_in_canada | CPP]] and OAS, a backup plan is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. The sooner you plan, the more options you have to ensure financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

Understanding and actively managing your net worth is crucial for achieving financial freedom, even more so than focusing solely on income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While a high income might seem like a mark of success, someone earning significantly less but investing wisely can be in a better long-term financial position than a high earner who spends all their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Net worth represents the total value of what you own (assets like cash, investments, and property) minus what you owe (debts like mortgages, loans, and credit cards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Tracking your net worth allows you to assess your current financial standing and make necessary adjustments to reach your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

To begin assessing your financial position and creating a [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_financial_data | strategy for building wealth]], you can utilize tools like a free net worth tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## RRSP Rollovers for Dependent Children

In specific situations, you can transfer your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to a dependent child or grandchild without immediate tax consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>. This is typically applicable if the child is financially dependent due to their age or a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>

This strategy allows for the tax-free transfer of an RRSP balance to a qualifying dependent child or grandchild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:14">[02:41:14]</a>. The recipient then defers paying taxes on the funds until they begin making [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | withdrawals]] from the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

#### Example: David and Lily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:43">[02:52:43]</a>
Consider David, who passes away with a $500,000 RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:43">[02:52:43]</a>. His 17-year-old granddaughter, Lily, qualifies as a dependent due to her disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Through this rollover, the RRSP is transferred to Lily tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:23">[03:00:23]</a>.

Without this rollover, the $500,000 would be taxed at a high marginal rate (e.g., 53%), leaving only $235,000 for his beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:26">[03:02:26]</a>. With the rollover, Lily does not owe taxes until she starts making [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies | withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Pros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:33">[03:15:33]</a>

*   **Avoids Immediate Taxes:** It prevents immediate taxation of the RRSP balance at death if the dependent child meets the qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:33">[03:15:33]</a>.
*   **Financial Support:** It offers vital financial support to children or grandchildren who are in need due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Cons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:25">[03:23:25]</a>

*   **Strict Rules:** This strategy is subject to quite strict eligibility rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:25">[03:23:25]</a>.
*   **Dependency Requirement:** The child must be deemed dependent either due to their age or a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Availability:** It is generally not an option for most adult children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:41">[03:29:41]</a>.

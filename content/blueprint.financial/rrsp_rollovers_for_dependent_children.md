Upon the death of an RRSP holder, the entire RRSP balance is typically added to their income for that year and taxed at their highest marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. For instance, an RRSP balance of $700,000 could be taxed at 53% in Ontario, leaving only $329,000 for beneficiaries after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. However, there are strategies to minimize this tax impact.

One such strategy involves RRSP rollovers for dependent children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## How it Works

In specific situations, you can transfer your RRSP to a dependent child or grandchild tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This is typically applicable if they are financially dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

### Example

Consider David, who passed away with a $500,000 RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. His 17-year-old granddaughter, Lily, qualified as a dependent due to her disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. The $500,000 RRSP was transferred to her tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Without this rollover, the $500,000 would have been taxed at 53%, resulting in only $235,000 for his beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. With the rollover, Lily will not owe taxes until she begins making withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Pros

*   **Avoids Immediate Taxes** This approach helps avoid immediate taxes if the dependent child qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Support** It provides financial support for children or grandchildren in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Cons

*   **Strict Rules** The rules for this type of rollover are quite strict; the child must be dependent due to age or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Availability** This strategy is generally not available for most adult children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

When leaving Canada, a critical step is to properly establish your tax residency status to avoid continued Canadian tax obligations on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Failure to clearly define this status can lead to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) still considering you a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## The NR73 Form: A Common Pitfall

Many individuals assume that filing Form NR73, the "Residency Determination Form," will help confirm their non-resident status with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, this form can actually work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. When submitted, a CRA official reviews your case and may determine that you remain a Canadian tax resident, even if you believe you've completely cut ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This could result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Alternative to Filing NR73

Instead of filing Form NR73:
*   **Skip the form** It is not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **File a departure tax return** Report your departure date and pay any applicable exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Let your actions prove non-residency** Actively sever significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Understanding Canadian Tax Residency Status

Canada taxes individuals based on residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If this "umbilical cord" isn't cut properly, Canada may still consider you attached and subject to tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

There are four main types of tax residency status when considering moving countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:

*   **Factual Resident**: Someone who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties to the country, even if temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Emigrant**: An individual who leaves Canada permanently and severs significant residential ties with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The CRA considers an individual an emigrant for tax purposes if they leave Canada and establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Non-resident**: An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Non-residents do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but can be taxed on Canadian-sourced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Deemed Non-resident**: Occurs when you qualify as a tax resident in another country with which Canada has a tax treaty, meaning Canada won't tax you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The key difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident is how tax residency is determined and whether a tax treaty applies, though both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Severing Residential Ties to Confirm Non-Residency

The CRA assesses your residential ties to determine if you remain a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Failing to properly sever these ties can result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Primary Residential Ties
These are the strongest indicators of residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>:
*   **Home in Canada**: Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada**: If they remain in Canada, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada**: Such as children or other dependents living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
Maintaining any of these ties strongly suggests you are still a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Secondary Residential Ties
These may also influence residency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>:
*   **Personal Property**: Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Social Ties**: Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Ties**: Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Canadian Documentation**: Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Mailing Address**: Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can keep you classified as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### How to Sever Residential Ties
To confirm non-residency, consider these actions:
*   **Sell or Rent Out Your Canadian Home**: Leasing it to unrelated parties demonstrates you have left Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Move Your Family Abroad**: Bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Close or Convert Canadian Financial Accounts**: Terminate accounts or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Update Government Records**: Change your address, cancel health coverage, and surrender your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Establishing Residency in a New Country

Properly establishing legal residency in another country is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Failing to secure official tax residency status elsewhere can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident, making you liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

Steps to properly establish residency elsewhere include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>:
*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency**: Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Set Up Financial Ties**: Open a bank account, rent or buy a house, obtain an ID card, and register for health insurance in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in Your New Country**: Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Leaving Canada involves complex tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Without proper planning, you could face unexpected liabilities or even double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

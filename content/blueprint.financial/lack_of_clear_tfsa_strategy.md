One of the most common "silent wealth killers" in a [[Taxfree savings account TFSA and withdrawal strategies | Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)]] is using it without a clear strategy, or worse, treating it like a piggy bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Consequences of Poor Strategy

Frequent withdrawals and redeposits not only disrupt the power of compounding but can also lead to overcontribution penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. While the TFSA is designed as a powerful tool for tax-free growth, it cannot fulfill its purpose when treated as a revolving door for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Without a long-term vision, thousands of dollars in potential growth can be left unrealized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Lack of Coordination with Other Accounts

A significant issue arising from a lack of strategy is poor coordination with other financial accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. For example:
*   Many individuals use their TFSA to save for a first home, unaware of potentially better tools like the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) or the enhanced Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   In [[Role of TFSA in retirement planning | retirement planning]], there's often a lack of coordination between TFSA and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This oversight frequently results in missed opportunities for tax savings and investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Solutions and Intentional Goal Setting

Individuals who succeed with their TFSA are those who set intentional goals for its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. For instance, a personal goal might be to use the TFSA to fund an early retirement, which provides discipline and shapes a strategy that works in conjunction with other accounts like RSPs, FHSAs, and future Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Consider these questions to clarify your TFSA strategy:

> *   What exactly is my TFSA for? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>
> *   How will it fit into my overall financial plan in the future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

Potential goals for your TFSA include:
*   Growing wealth to leave a legacy for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>
*   Supplementing [[Role of TFSA in retirement planning | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>
*   Saving for significant life milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

By treating your TFSA like a fortress for your future, you can avoid this silent killer and unlock its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

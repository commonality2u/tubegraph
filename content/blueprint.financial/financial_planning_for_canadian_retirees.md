Many [[Financial planning for retirement | Canadian retirees]] often overlook opportunities to reduce their tax burden by not effectively managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals [00:00:08]. A key strategy involves leveraging the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) in conjunction with RSP/RRIF withdrawals to reduce taxes, enhance tax-free growth, and ultimately secure a more comfortable retirement [00:00:15].

## The Problem: Unused TFSA Room [00:00:24]

Despite the advantages of TFSAs, many Canadians do not fully utilize their contribution room [00:00:43]. Out of 17.77 million Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to maximize their contributions [00:00:32]. This results in missed opportunities for tax-free growth [00:00:45].

For retirees, this issue is particularly prevalent, with many entering their retirement years holding tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room [00:00:53]. Among Canadians aged 60 and older, a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions [00:01:04]. For instance, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60-64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions [00:01:10]. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75-79, before slightly declining to 14% for those 80 and older [00:01:20]. This trend is linked to the strategic use of RRIF withdrawals for TFSA contributions [00:01:38].

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances [00:01:56]

While RSPs are beneficial for saving during working years, withdrawals are considered taxable income, which can elevate a retiree's tax bracket [00:02:03]. Upon turning 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requires conversion of RSPs into Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs) and mandates annual withdrawals, regardless of whether the funds are needed [00:02:07].

## The Strategy: RRIF to TFSA Tactic [00:02:16]

If a retiree's mandatory RRIF withdrawals exceed their immediate spending needs, the surplus funds can be contributed to a TFSA and invested [00:02:18]. This approach has the potential to save thousands of dollars over the long term [00:02:23].

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan [00:02:25]

Consider Eddie, a 71-year-old who has converted his RSP to a RRIF [00:02:27]. The CRA requires Eddie to withdraw $30,000 annually from his RRIF [00:02:32]. As Eddie is in a 30% tax bracket, $9,000 of this withdrawal is owed in taxes, leaving him with $21,000 after tax [00:02:37].

Eddie's situation is that his existing income sources, such as Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions, cover most of his living expenses, requiring only $11,000 of the $21,000 RRIF withdrawal [00:02:48]. This leaves him with $10,000 in excess RRIF income [00:02:57].

Instead of placing this surplus in a regular savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a diversified portfolio of stocks and ETFs [00:03:09].

#### TFSA Growth Comparison [00:03:19]

Assuming an average annual return of 6%, here's how Eddie's TFSA grows compared to a non-registered account:

| Account Type        | Annual Contribution | Annual Growth Rate (Net of Taxes) | Balance After 10 Years | Tax Savings (vs. Non-Registered) |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------- |
| **TFSA**            | $10,000             | 6% (tax-free)                     | ~$132,000              | ~$12,000                         |
| **Non-Registered**  | $10,000             | ~4% (after 30% tax on gains)      | ~$120,000              | N/A                              |
| **Taxable Savings** | $10,000             | 1% (taxable)                      | ~$55,000 (estimated)   | N/A                              |

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27"></a>
*   **TFSA Scenario:** Eddie contributes $10,000 annually. After 10 years, he has contributed $100,000, and his TFSA grows to approximately $132,000, all completely tax-free [00:03:46].
*   **Non-Registered Account Scenario:** If Eddie invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, his investments would grow at 6% annually, but 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, resulting in an effective growth rate of around 4% [00:03:56]. Over 10 years, his non-registered account would grow to approximately $120,000 after taxes [00:04:19].
*   **Taxable Savings Account Scenario:** If the money were placed in a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the growth would be significantly lower, potentially closer to $55,000 over 10 years [00:04:31].

### Key Takeaways [00:04:38]

By consistently contributing his excess RRIF income into his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes due to avoiding annual tax on growth [00:04:41]. His TFSA balance grows to $132,000, significantly more than the $120,000 in a non-registered account or an estimated $55,000 in a savings account [00:04:46]. This approach maximizes retirement savings and offers flexibility for future needs or continued tax-free compounding [00:04:57].

:::info Pro Tips
*   Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room available [00:05:15].
*   Avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years when you anticipate high income from other sources, such as the sale of property or assets [00:05:25].

## Does This Strategy Eliminate RSP Taxes? [00:05:39]

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals [00:05:46]. RSP withdrawals are still considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate [00:05:51].

However, by strategically combining RSP/RRIF withdrawals with TFSA contributions, you can effectively manage and potentially reduce your overall taxable income [00:05:57]. This approach can also help avoid additional penalties like Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks [00:06:02]. The goal is to minimize tax impact while maximizing overall retirement income [00:06:07].

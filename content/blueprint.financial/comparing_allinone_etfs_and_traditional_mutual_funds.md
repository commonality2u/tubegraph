All-in-one ETFs, also known as asset allocation ETFs, are designed to simplify investing by bundling multiple Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) into a single product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. They offer instant diversification across stocks, bonds, and global markets, eliminating the need to select individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## How All-in-One ETFs Work

An example of a popular all-in-one ETF in Canada is Vanguard VGRO, which manages over $6 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. VGRO provides exposure to a wide array of global stocks and bonds, resulting in an instantly diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Typically, an all-in-one ETF like VGRO includes:
*   **Stocks** A significant allocation, for example, 80% in VGRO, with a mix of Canadian, US, International, and emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This can offer access to over 13,000 companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Bonds** A smaller allocation, for example, 20% in VGRO, consisting of a blend of Canadian and global bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Bonds help to stabilize the portfolio during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

This diversification approach reduces risk and can enhance returns by spreading investments across various countries, industries, and asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## All-in-One ETFs vs. Traditional Mutual Funds

All-in-one ETFs offer several advantages when compared to traditional mutual funds, particularly in terms of cost and management.

### Cost Structure
*   **All-in-One ETFs** One of the most significant advantages of [[benefits_of_investing_in_allinone_etfs | all-in-one ETFs]] is their low fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They typically charge a Management Expense Ratio (MER) between 0.2% and 0.25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For instance, VGRO has an MER of 0.24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Traditional Mutual Funds** In Canada, traditional mutual funds commonly charge MERs around 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This higher fee significantly eats into investor returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Examples from RBC's site show many mutual funds charging approximately 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Auto-Rebalancing
*   **All-in-One ETFs** These ETFs automatically rebalance their asset mix, buying and selling internally to maintain the intended stock-to-bond ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This means investors do not need to manually adjust their portfolio, keeping it on track effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Traditional Mutual Funds** While some mutual funds may rebalance, the mechanism and transparency can vary. The auto-rebalancing feature of all-in-one ETFs is a key benefit for low-maintenance investing.

### Diversification & Management
*   **All-in-One ETFs** They provide a professionally managed portfolio with exposure to thousands of investments worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This instant diversification makes them perfect for smaller accounts, as a single ETF gives broad exposure without needing to spread money across multiple funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. They are designed to be standalone investments, and adding more funds can actually disrupt their carefully designed balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Traditional Mutual Funds** While mutual funds also offer diversification, the range and type of holdings can vary widely, and some may suffer from [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexing]] where they mirror an index but charge active management fees. The high fees on [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | mutual funds]] are a significant concern that can lead to [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformance]] compared to low-cost index funds or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The [[First Home Savings Account FHSA benefits and strategies | First Home Savings Account (FHSA)]] is considered a top tax deduction for a registered account in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. It's a new registered account designed to help Canadians save for their [[Financial planning and tax advantages for home ownership in Canada | first home]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Key Advantages
The FHSA combines some of the best features of both the [[Comparison between FHSA and RRSP | RRSP]] and [[Taxfree savings account withdrawal strategy | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. It is often recommended that those who qualify invest in the FHSA before contributing to their [[Situations favoring RRSP over FHSA | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Key benefits include:
*   **Flexibility** If you don't end up buying a home, you can transfer your savings to an [[RRSP | RRSP]] or RRIF without losing tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **No Impact on [[RRSP | RRSP]] Room** Contributions to your FHSA do not affect your [[RRSP | RRSP]] contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **No Repayment Required** Unlike the Home Buyers' Plan under the [[RRSP | RRSP]], you are not required to repay amounts withdrawn from your FHSA when buying a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Tax-Deductible Contributions** Contributions made to your FHSA are tax deductible, similar to an [[Tax benefits of FHSA versus RRSP | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals** Funds withdrawn from your FHSA for a home down payment are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This significantly boosts your ability to afford a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Tax-Deferred Growth** If you transfer your FHSA funds to an [[RRSP | RRSP]] or RRIF because you didn't buy a home, the savings will continue to grow tax-deferred until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The FHSA is considered a win-win, whether you purchase a home or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Eligibility
To qualify for an FHSA, you must meet the following criteria:
*   Be a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   Be at least 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   Be a [[Strategies for maximizing taxfree savings for a down payment | first-time home buyer]], meaning you have not owned a home in the current year or the previous four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Example Scenario: Sarah's FHSA
Sarah, 30 years old, aims to buy her [[Financial planning and tax advantages for home ownership in Canada | first home]] within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. She opens an FHSA and contributes [[First Home Savings Account contributions and benefits | $8,000 annually]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Her marginal tax rate is 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

After five years:
*   Sarah has contributed $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Her account grows to $50,000 with tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   She has saved $12,000 in taxes due to the deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Two potential scenarios:
1.  **Sarah buys a home:** She withdraws the $50,000 from her FHSA completely tax-free for her down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
2.  **Sarah does not buy a home:** In 15 years, she can transfer the amount in her FHSA to her [[RRSP | RRSP]] or RRIF tax-free, allowing her savings to continue growing tax-deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

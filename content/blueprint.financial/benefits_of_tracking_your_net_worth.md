Tracking your goals significantly increases the likelihood of achieving them; a study at Michigan State University found it makes individuals 33% more likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This principle applies directly to personal finances. For example, tracking net worth since 2019 transformed financial management and contributed to wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?

Tracking your net worth is comparable to tracking weight loss: small, consistent actions drive substantial results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Research from the University of Connecticut and the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets experienced significant outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Those who tracked approximately 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while participants who tracked 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The key takeaway is that tracking correlates with success towards your goals, even if it's not perfectly executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The same principle extends to your finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can:
*   Spot financial trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Make smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Stay on course towards your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Just like weight loss, consistency is more important than perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics such as total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Steering Your Financial Ship

[[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | Tracking your net worth]] is akin to steering a ship with a compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Without this compass, you wouldn't know if you were drifting off course from your financial objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Practical Benefits of Net Worth Tracking

Tracking doesn't have to be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. [[using_spreadsheets_for_financial_tracking | Using tools like a simple Google Sheet]] makes the process easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Setting up such a system can take as little as 10 to 20 minutes, with subsequent monthly updates requiring only about two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

A dedicated net worth tracker can display:
*   Your current net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   The shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Visual representations and summary data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

It is recommended to set a recurring monthly reminder to update your tracker, which helps maintain commitment to the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. When assessing your financial goals, it can be helpful to consider resources like videos on average net worth in Canada and how net worth increases after reaching the [[importance_of_reaching_the_first_100000_net_worth_milestone | $100,000 milestone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

As you [[tracking_and_comparing_net_worth_annually | track your net worth]] throughout the year, you should ideally observe a gradual increase in your net worth trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. However, dips are likely to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Tracking helps you:
*   **Identify Causes of Dips:** By looking at your data, you can pinpoint what happened during periods of decline, such as significant drops in specific long-term assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Re-evaluate Strategies:** A clear representation of changes, especially significant asset drops, can serve as a red flag, prompting you to re-evaluate your risk tolerance or investment [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_financial_data | strategies for increasing personal net worth using financial data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Monitor Asset vs. Liability Trends:** The tracker provides a breakdown of assets versus liabilities and their trends over time, helping you understand where variations occur (e.g., primarily in assets rather than liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Annual Comparison:** After each year is complete, you can create a new copy of your tracker to fill in data for subsequent years (e.g., 2026, 2027) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This allows you to accumulate a balance sheet of your net worth over time and compare your performance year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Alternative Tracking Methods

While [[using_spreadsheets_for_financial_tracking | using a custom spreadsheet]] is highly effective, other tools are available for Canadians to track their net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. However, these often come with costs or limitations:
*   **Wetha:** Connects to financial accounts for an automatic overview but locks advanced features behind a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Quicken (replacing Mint):** Mint was previously a popular free option but has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While comprehensive, its cost may not be justified when free alternatives exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard:** A budgeting app with a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

For many, a personal spreadsheet remains the preferred method because it is completely free, offers full control, and is highly customizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Updating it monthly can be a rewarding process, keeping you engaged with your finances and providing a clear visual overview of your net worth goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Conclusion

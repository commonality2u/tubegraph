Canada offers numerous tax credits, making it easy to overlook significant opportunities for refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide outlines key tax credits, including common ones and often-overlooked "hidden gems," and explains how to [[strategies_for_stacking_multiple_credits_for_larger_tax_savings | stack multiple credits]] for even greater tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_stacking_multiple_credits_for_larger_tax_savings | Stacking Multiple Credits]] for Bigger Refunds

The key to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | maximizing tax savings]] isn't just knowing about individual credits, but about [[strategies_for_stacking_multiple_credits_for_larger_tax_savings | stacking them together]] for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many Canadians don't realize how certain tax credits and deductions can work together effectively, reducing taxable income or boosting refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Savings Combo
This strategy involves combining the pension income amount and the age amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Amount**: Up to $2,000 per person for eligible pension income, reducing taxes for those 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Example**: If John and Linda are both retired, and John has a large pension while Linda has a smaller income, they can each claim the pension income amount. If John is also over 65, he qualifies for the age amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Stacked Savings**: Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Bonus Tip**: Pension income splitting can save even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds, especially if they have kids or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefit (CCB)**: Tax-free monthly payments for parents with kids under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Example**: Sarah and Mike have two young kids in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   They receive CCB for child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   They receive the Canada Caregiver Amount due to their child's disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Stacked Savings**: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Bonus Tip**: Families can also split income by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

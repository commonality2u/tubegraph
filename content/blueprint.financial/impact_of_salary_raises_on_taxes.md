The [[impact_of_salary_increases_on_taxation | impact of salary increases on taxation]] is often misunderstood, leading to common myths about taking home less money after a raise.

## Understanding the Myth

A prevalent misconception suggests that if a salary raise pushes an individual into a higher [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]], they might end up with less take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. For example, an employee earning $56,000 might be hesitant to accept a raise to $60,000 if their current federal [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] is 15% and the new income would place them in a 20.5% [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] upon crossing the $57,375 income threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This concern stems from a misunderstanding of how Canadian taxes are structured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## How Canadian Taxes Work

Canada operates under a [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of your income are taxed at different rates, depending on the [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] they fall into. Specifically:
*   Only the income earned *above* a certain threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For instance, if the threshold is $57,375 and the higher rate is 20.5%, only the income exceeding $57,375 will be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   All income earned *below* that threshold continues to be taxed at the lower, original rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. So, income below $57,375 would still be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Always Better to Get a Raise

Given the nature of the [[progressive_tax_system_explained | progressive tax system]], it is always financially beneficial to accept a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The idea that you might take home less money due to a raise is a "classic myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This demonstrates the [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | benefits of earning more despite higher taxes]], as an increase in gross income will always result in an increase in net (take-home) income.

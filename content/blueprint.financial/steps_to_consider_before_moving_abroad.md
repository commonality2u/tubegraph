Many Canadians are choosing to leave the country. In 2022, the number of Canadians moving to the U.S. alone reached 126,340, a significant 70% increase from the 75,752 who made the move in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It's estimated that approximately 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad in 2016, and this number has likely grown since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Why Canadians Are Moving Abroad

Several factors contribute to the decision to leave Canada:

*   **Cost of Living** The primary reason many people want to leave Canada is the rising cost of living, particularly in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where housing prices have significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Moving to countries like Mexico, Portugal, or certain parts of the United States can substantially reduce expenses for things like housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Harsh Winters** Canada's harsh winters, with temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, drive many to seek milder climates, trading snow shovels for beach towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Healthcare System** Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces challenges, including long wait times for medical services and a low doctor-to-population ratio, leading to dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. According to the Commonwealth Fund, Canada ranks poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Adventure and New Experiences** Living abroad offers adventure, allowing individuals to immerse themselves in new cultures, cuisines, and ways of life, providing opportunities for personal growth and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Steps to Take Before Moving Abroad

### Step 1: Make Sure You Want to Leave Canada

Before making the permanent move, consider a trial run. Spend a few weeks or months living in the country (or countries) you're considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This hands-on experience is crucial for gaining insights into the local lifestyle, culture, safety, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. It allows you to determine if the new environment truly fits your lifestyle or if you might miss aspects of Canadian life, such as its healthcare system or established friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Trying to live like a local during this period is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Step 2: Making Money Abroad

Unless you are financially independent, you will need a plan for [[ways_to_make_money_while_living_overseas | making money while living overseas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Three common paths include:

*   **Expat through a Company Transfer**
    *   **How to Pursue**: Seek opportunities within your current company, express interest to HR in international positions, and network with colleagues who have worked abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Offers job security, maintains existing job and benefits, provides relocation assistance, and boosts career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Less flexibility over location and work assignments, requires adapting to new work culture, and usually demands a longer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Remote Work**
    *   **How to Pursue**: Find jobs on websites like Remote.co, We Work Remotely, and FlexJobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Set up a home office with reliable internet and essential tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Manage time effectively with tools like Trello or Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Provides flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection, saving time and money on commuting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Can be isolating without office social interaction, requires high self-motivation and time management skills, and may offer less job security or benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Common fields include software, IT, HR, sales, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Digital Nomad**
    *   **How to Pursue**: Develop a marketable skill or service (e.g., freelance writing, graphic design, programming, consulting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Build an online portfolio and find clients on platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Offers freedom to travel and experience new cultures, working for multiple clients can provide stability, and fosters personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Income can be unpredictable, balancing work and travel is challenging, navigating visas and work permits can be complicated, and not having a home base can be tiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Digital nomads engage in diverse fields such as digital marketing, startups, content creation, and even therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Step 3: Understanding How to Become a Non-Resident of Canada

To become a non-resident of Canada for tax purposes, you must sever significant residential ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This includes [[considerations_for_selling_your_house_before_leaving_canada | selling your home]], closing Canadian bank accounts, and relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The most significant factor is where you spend your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **Documentation**: Keep documentation of your new residency status, such as rental agreements and utility bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Departure Tax**: Be aware of the departure tax, which applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. You'll pay tax on unrealized gains of investments and real estate, though RRSPs, RIFs, and certain real estate are exempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. These deemed dispositions must be reported on your final tax return, and any capital gains tax paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **TFSA**: Your TFSA can remain open, but you cannot make contributions as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Earnings within it remain tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **RSP/RIF**: You can keep your RSP and RIF accounts, but withdrawals will be subject to a 25% withholding tax, which may be reducible by tax treaties with your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **[[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | CPP benefits for Canadians moving abroad]]**: You can continue to receive CPP payments abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **[[gis_benefits_and_the_implications_of_retiring_abroad | OAS benefits for Canadians moving abroad]]**: You are eligible to receive OAS payments outside Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Step 4: Understanding Your New Country's Rules

Understanding the rules of your new country can be more challenging than Canadian non-residency rules, especially due to distance and potential language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. To ensure a smooth transition, research the following:

*   **Residency and Tax Laws**: Research the residency requirements of your new country, including temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Some countries require address registration upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident and investigate tax treaties with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **[[visa_options_for_retiring_abroad | Visa Laws]]**: Understand the different visa options and choose the one that fits your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Familiarize yourself with required documents, timelines, conditions (e.g., work, study, length of stay), and renewal procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Learn how to open a local bank account by choosing a reputable bank and preparing necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Understand the local currency, exchange rates, and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Other Important Regulations**:
    *   **[[safety_and_healthcare_abroad | Healthcare]]**: Learn about the local healthcare system and whether you need to purchase health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Driving**: Understand local driving laws and requirements, including international driving permits or converting your Canadian license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   **Legal Requirements**: Learn about local laws and emergency services to avoid legal issues and ensure your safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Step 5: Explore Getting Citizenship Elsewhere

Securing [[pathways_to_citizenship_in_a_new_country | citizenship in a new country]] offers benefits like stability, access to local services, and full integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Common pathways include:

*   **Citizenship by Naturalization**: This usually involves living and working in a country for a specific period (e.g., 5 years in Germany if working there and meeting language/integration requirements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Requires continuous residency, compliance with local laws, and often a language test or cultural integration demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Investment**: Countries grant citizenship in exchange for significant financial investments (e.g., Turkey offers citizenship for purchasing real estate worth at least $400,000 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This involves making the required investment, providing proof of funds, and meeting any additional residency or legal requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Relatives and Ancestry**: If you have parents, grandparents, or sometimes great-grandparents from another country, you might be eligible for citizenship by descent (e.g., Italian citizenship through Italian ancestry or Irish citizenship with an Irish grandparent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This process typically involves gathering relevant certificates (birth, marriage) and submitting them to the consulate or embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Other Ways**: Marrying a citizen of another country can often speed up the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Some countries, like the UAE, grant citizenships for exceptional skills in fields such as science or culture, usually involving nomination or demonstrating contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Bonus Tip: Researching Cost of Living with Numbeo

For a quick estimate of the cost of living in a new country, use the website Numbeo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
1.  Go to Numbeo's "Cost of Living Comparison" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  Type in your current city (e.g., Toronto) and the city you want to move to (e.g., Mexico City) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
3.  The tool provides a breakdown of various costs, showing comparisons between the two cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. For example, the cost of living in Mexico City might be 37% lower than in Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, with specific categories like eating out being significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

While the data is user-entered, it's generally accurate for more popular cities and provides a good ballpark estimate of expected costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

If you are seriously considering moving countries, it is highly recommended to consult with a cross-border tax specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

A significant number of Canadians, approximately 106,000, permanently left the country in 2024, often driven by high costs, high taxes, and concerns about outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many are choosing to retire abroad to make their money stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, enabling a better quality of life than what might be possible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The High [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | Cost of Living in Canada]]

Living in Canada, particularly for retirees, is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount, which might have been sufficient decades ago, is often inadequate in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For instance, modest monthly expenses in Toronto for a single person who doesn't own a home can easily exceed $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
*   **Rent (one-bedroom)**: Around $2,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>
*   **Utilities**: Approximately $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   **[[average_grocery_spending_in_canada | Groceries]]**: Around $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
*   **Transit Pass**: $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

CPP and OAS payments barely cover a third of these expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. According to Numbio, a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month *without* rent, meaning total modest monthly costs with rent are $3,500 to $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This reality leads many Canadians to delay retirement or seek [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | smarter options abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Toronto

Seth, with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes, retired in Toronto at age 65 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He aimed to spend $50,000 annually, relying on $18,000 from CPP and OAS, with the rest from RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   By age 70, his TFSA was drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relied solely on RRSP withdrawals (over $46,000 annually), with effective tax rates above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   By age 74, he was out of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   By age 76, his net worth was negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
Seth's modest living costs were simply too high for his savings to sustain in Toronto, even without accounting for [[inflation_and_food_prices_in_canada | inflation]], market returns, or unexpected costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Retiring Abroad: A Comparison of Living Costs and Quality of Life

Retiring abroad can transform retirement, allowing savings to stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Numbio is a useful tool for estimating global living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 1. Mexico (Cancun)

Mexico is a top choice for Canadian retirees due to its warm climate, affordability, and proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns like Cancun and Puerto Vallarta, or mild spring-like weather in cities like Guadalajara <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and fast private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Dental work can be 20% of the price in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Public healthcare is generally not available to foreigners, making private insurance essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Visas**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings, depending on the consulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Convenient direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs**: Safety concerns vary by region, infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, bureaucracy requires patience, and some Spanish language skills are helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

#### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Cancun

If Seth retired in Cancun instead of Toronto, with the same $300,000 savings:
*   **Monthly Cost**: According to Numbio, a single person renting a one-bedroom spends about $1,700 CAD per month all-in, totaling around $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: With much lower living costs, his CPP and OAS covered most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. His portfolio grew:
    *   Age 70: $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>
    *   Age 80: $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
    *   Age 90: Over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
This illustrates the significant impact location can have on retirement wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### 2. Portugal (Porto)

For those preferring a European lifestyle, Portugal offers old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable [[living_costs_and_quality_of_life_in_different_countries | cost of living]] for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers. The Algarve has beach weather nearly all year, while Porto and Lisbon are cooler and breezier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent. Residents can access the public system, and private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Visas**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring steady income (e.g., CPP, pensions, investments) of about â‚¬870 per month ($1,400 CAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Farther than Mexico, but Lisbon and Porto offer direct flights to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

#### Case Study: Seth's Retirement in Portugal (Porto)

Portugal's costs fall between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. If Seth chose Porto:
*   **Monthly Cost**: Rent around $1,300, plus $1,700 for other expenses, totaling about $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This is similar to the lower end of Canadian retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: With $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP/OAS, Seth's plan seemed manageable initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   By age 75, savings dropped to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   By age 80, savings were just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   By age 84, he was out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
While Portugal offered a longer runway than Toronto, $3,000 per month in expenses was still too high for his savings to last long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

**Adjustments for Seth in Portugal**: If Seth delayed CPP to age 70 and started drawing from his RRSP from 65-69, he could extend his savings by two years, running out at age 86 instead of 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Further adjustments, like working longer, trimming spending, or earning from a hobby, could make his plan comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### 3. Thailand

Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Diverse options from cool mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) or city energy (Bangkok). Features a well-developed expat scene, rich culture, and incredible food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and considered among the best in Asia, with many English-speaking doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Visas**: Retirement visa requires being 50 years or older and showing 800,000 Thai Baht (about $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can cost $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For someone with $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, this covers most basic needs, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 4. Paraguay

Paraguay is an emerging destination, particularly due to its tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Tax System**: Runs on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income like CPP, OAS, RIFs, or pensions is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asuncion, living expenses are about $628 per month, with rent for a one-bedroom around $583, totaling just over $1,200 per month for a good lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Visas**: Offers relatively easy permanent residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
Paraguay offers a "financial sweet spot" with very low costs, tax efficiency, and simple long-term settlement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### 5. Spain (Alicante)

Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, Numbio data suggests monthly living costs around $1,057, with one-bedroom rent in the city center at about $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Total monthly expenses are around $2,400 to $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, which is comparable to parts of Canada but potentially cheaper than some parts of Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Visas**: Canadians can apply for the non-lucrative visa, requiring about $40,000 to $45,000 CAD per year in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is a higher bar, but achievable with planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
Spain provides a higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Moving Abroad

### Old Age Security (OAS) Rule

It's crucial to understand that OAS payments can be lost if retiring abroad without meeting a key rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>:
*   If you apply while living in Canada, only 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 are needed to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   However, if living outside Canada, **20 years of residency** are required to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

**Example**: David, aged 67, had 15 years of Canadian residency and collected OAS in Calgary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. When he retired to Thailand, his OAS stopped 6 months later because Thailand doesn't have a social security agreement with Canada, and David didn't meet the 20-year residency mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Make sure to understand the rules before moving to avoid losing income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_living_abroad | CPP benefits]] may have different rules.

### Other Considerations for Moving Abroad
*   **Research Costs**: Use tools like Numbio to compare rent, food, and utilities in your target country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Financial Planning**: Do not rely solely on CPP and OAS. Inflation, currency shifts, or unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Personal Challenges**: Life abroad is not for everyone. Distance from family, adapting to new systems, and language barriers can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Professional Guidance**: A low-cost retirement must be backed by a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Consulting with financial experts who specialize in expatriate finances can help map out costs, taxes, and potential "what-ifs" to ensure a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

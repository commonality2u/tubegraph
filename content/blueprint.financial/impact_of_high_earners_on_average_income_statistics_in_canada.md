High-income earners significantly influence and can skew average income statistics in Canada, leading to a notable disparity between average and median income figures. This phenomenon highlights [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | growing income concentration]] and [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | income inequality]] at the very top of the income spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

## Discrepancy Between Median and Average Incomes

The difference between median and average incomes serves as a key indicator of how top earners impact overall statistics. The median income represents the midpoint of all incomes, while the average income is calculated by summing all incomes and dividing by the number of earners. A larger gap between these two figures suggests that a smaller number of high earners are significantly "lifting" the average.

### Top 10% Earners
For the top 10% of individual income earners in Canada as of 2022:
*   The median income was $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.
*   The average income was $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

This represents a gap of over $50,000 between the average and median income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. This significant difference illustrates how a small number of ultra-high earners can considerably raise the average income for this group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Billionaires like Jim Patterson, with an estimated net worth over $11 billion, are explicitly noted to skew the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Top 5% Earners
For the top 5% of earners in 2022:
*   The median income was $193,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   The average income was $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

The average income for this group was over $75,000 more than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, again indicating a growing [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | income concentration]] at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

### Top 1% Earners
For the top 1% of earners in 2022:
*   The median income was $388,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   The average income was $586,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

In this exclusive group, the average income was nearly $200,000 higher than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. This substantial gap is a clear indication of how much income is concentrated among the ultra-elite, particularly within the top 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Contrast with Average Canadian Incomes

The impact of high earners becomes even starker when compared to the median income for the general Canadian population. The median income for most Canadians ranges between $35,000 and $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

For instance, the highest median income by age group (45 to 54 years old) is $51,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. This figure is significantly below the threshold for the top 10% ($111,900) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, which is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

The rising median and average incomes within the top 10%, 5%, and 1% groups, which grow faster than national income averages, consistently point to a [[income_distribution_and_inequality_trends_in_canada | continued widening of income inequality in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This suggests that while average income figures may show overall growth, the benefits of this growth are disproportionately concentrated at the top.

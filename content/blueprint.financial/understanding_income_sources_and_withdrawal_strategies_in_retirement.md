Understanding and strategically managing your income sources and withdrawals is a crucial step in ensuring a financially secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. A clear understanding of where your money will come from and how much you'll need sets you up for financial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Current Income Streams

As you approach retirement, it's important to have a strong income base. For example, Pam and Jim, a fictional couple, had a combined total employment income of $160,000 in 2024, with additional sources bringing their total to $190,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Their income remained strong up until retirement, allowing them to comfortably save and prepare for their long-term [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Strategic Withdrawals from Savings Accounts

Careful planning for withdrawals from registered and non-registered accounts can help maximize your savings and ensure a steady income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **TFSAs (Tax-Free Savings Accounts)**: Jim and Pam planned to start withdrawing from their TFSAs when Jim turned 65 in 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **RRSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans)**: They intended to start withdrawing from their RRSPs when Jim turned 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This gradual approach helps them maximize their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Government Benefits: CPP and OAS

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) are vital components of retirement income for many Canadians. Deciding when to start these benefits is key to maximizing your [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | retirement income]] and should align with your broader [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

*   **Starting Age**: Jim and Pam planned to start their CPP and [[investment_strategies_and_managing_withdrawals_to_maintain_oas_benefits_in_retirement | OAS benefits]] at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, expecting almost $30,000 combined from both sources in 2042 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This strategy balanced well with their overall retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Delaying Benefits**: You have the option to delay both CPP and OAS until age 70 for larger payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Starting Early**: Alternatively, you could start taking benefits earlier, at age 60, but this comes with a reduction of up to 36% for your CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

It is important to continually reassess your strategy for these benefits closer to retirement, based on your evolving [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | financial needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

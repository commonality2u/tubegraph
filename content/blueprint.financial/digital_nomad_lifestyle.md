The concept of a digital nomad describes an individual who has a source of income, typically online, that grants them the flexibility to travel globally and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Origins of the Dream
The founder of Wealth Awesome harbored a long-standing dream of becoming a digital nomad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This aspiration stemmed from a desire for the freedom to work from any location and be their own employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Early experiences backpacking across Asia in their teens and early twenties instilled a love for the adventure, culture, and energy associated with that lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The goal was to build a life that offered similar freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Enabling the Lifestyle
The financial success of the website Wealth Awesome played a crucial role in enabling this lifestyle. The income earned from the site, which significantly surpassed the initial goal of $3,000 per month, provided ample funds to support the digital nomad lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

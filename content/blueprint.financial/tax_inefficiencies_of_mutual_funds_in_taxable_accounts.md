[[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds | Tax inefficiency]] is an often-overlooked concern with mutual funds in Canada that can significantly impact returns, especially when these funds are held in a [[nonregistered_accounts_and_taxefficient_investments | non-registered taxable account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Reasons for Tax Inefficiency

### Capital Gains Distribution
Mutual funds are required to distribute any realized capital gains to their investors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This means investors may incur a tax bill on gains even if they haven't sold any shares themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. For example, if a fund sells appreciated holdings in December, an investor who bought in January could be hit with a capital gains distribution and a tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Frequent Trading
Actively managed mutual funds frequently engage in trading, which often results in numerous short-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. These short-term gains are taxed at a higher rate compared to long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. If a fund manager buys and sells within the same year, the profits are taxed at an investor's regular income tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Lack of Control Over Tax Timing
With mutual funds, investors are dependent on the fund manager's decisions regarding when to realize gains or losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This lack of control can lead to taxable events occurring at inconvenient times, increasing an investor's tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. An investor's plan to hold investments long-term for lower tax rates can be disrupted by a fund manager's frequent trading and taxable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

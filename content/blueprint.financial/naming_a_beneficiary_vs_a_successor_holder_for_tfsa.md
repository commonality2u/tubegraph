One of the most impactful, yet easiest, mistakes to correct when managing a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) is the designation of a beneficiary instead of a successor holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For individuals who are married or in a common-law relationship, it is crucial to name your spouse as a successor holder for your TFSA, rather than just a beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Why a Successor Holder is Crucial

The distinction between a beneficiary and a successor holder has significant financial implications, particularly concerning tax-free growth and contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

### Impact of Naming a Beneficiary

If a TFSA holder names their spouse as a beneficiary:
*   When the TFSA holder passes away, the spouse inherits the funds, but the TFSA account is subsequently closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   The inherited funds must then be transferred to a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   Any future gains on that money will be subject to tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   Crucially, the TFSA contribution room associated with the deceased's account is lost permanently, meaning future growth isn't tax-sheltered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   For example, if a spouse inherits $100,000 and earns a 5% annual return, they could owe taxes on $5,000 of gains each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Advantages of Naming a Successor Holder

When a spouse is named as a successor holder:
*   The surviving spouse takes over the TFSA completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   The funds remain within the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   All future gains continue to be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   The surviving spouse's own TFSA contribution room remains unaffected, allowing them to continue contributing to their personal account while benefiting from the deceased's TFSA as if it were their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Using the previous example, if the successor holder earns a 5% return on $100,000, they would owe zero taxes on the $5,000 annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This ensures the money continues working harder for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## How to Correct This Mistake

The process to fix this is straightforward:
1.  Contact your bank or TFSA provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
2.  Request to update your account to name your partner as a successor holder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

This simple 10-minute task can prevent your loved ones from losing out on significant tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Optimizing your savings across various accounts, including the FHSA, RRSP, and TFSA, can save you thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the FHSA is often prioritized for first-time home buyers due to its tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, and the TFSA offers flexibility and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, there are three crucial exceptions that offer significant "free money" opportunities: the RDSP, the RESP, and [[utilizing_tfsa_and_rrsp_for_tax_efficiency | RRSP]] employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. These accounts should be prioritized even before a TFSA or FHSA due to the "free money advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

## Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)

The RESP is designed to help families save for post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)
*   The Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) matches 20% of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.
*   It matches up to $500 per year per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
*   There is a lifetime maximum of $7,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.
*   For example, contributing $2,500 annually can yield a $500 grant from the CESG, boosting your savings and providing an automatic 20% return on investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

### Canada Learning Bond (CLB)
*   Lower-income families can also benefit from the Canada Learning Bond (CLB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   The CLB adds up to $2,000 without requiring contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

Starting early with an RESP maximizes growth, especially when combined with compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Additionally, the RESP can act as a form of income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## RRSP Employer Matching

If your employer offers [[spousal_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] matching, it's considered "free money" and should not be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

*   For instance, if an employer matches 50% of contributions up to $1,500, a $3,000 contribution yields an instant 50% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   Employer matching helps grow [[retirement_savings_using_fhsa_and_rrsp | retirement savings]] faster and adds discipline to saving habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
*   It is always advisable to maximize [[rrsp_to_tfsa_strategy_for_tax_savings | RRSP]] matching if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

## Account Prioritization

When considering where to invest your savings, the following order of priority is recommended, assuming you qualify for each account:

1.  **RDSP:** Prioritize the RDSP if you qualify, as it offers the most generous government grants for disability savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.
2.  **[[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | RRSP]] with Employer Matching:** Prioritize this to take advantage of free employer contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
3.  **RESP:** This account provides a 20% government match (up to $500 per year) for education savings and can also function as a form of income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
4.  **FHSA:** Best for first-time home buyers due to tax-deductible contributions and tax-free withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
5.  **[[rrsp_to_tfsa_strategy_for_tax_savings | RRSP]] or TFSA:** Choose [[rrsp_to_tfsa_strategy_for_tax_savings | RRSP]] for higher income tax deductions or TFSA for flexibility and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
6.  **Non-registered accounts:** These are the final destination after maximizing other tax-advantaged accounts, focusing on growth or Canadian dividend stocks for tax efficiency, while avoiding US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

The most suitable account depends on your individual financial goals, income, and savings needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

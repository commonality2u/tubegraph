Tipping culture in Canada is currently undergoing significant evolution, with various factors shaping its trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:48">[07:17:48]</a>. While it's unlikely to disappear overnight, shifts in consumer sentiment and business practices are paving the way for a more diverse landscape of service remuneration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:04">[07:22:04]</a>.

## Will Tip Percentages Keep Rising?
Over recent years, standard tip percentages have crept up from 15% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:43">[07:29:43]</a>. This upward trend might continue as costs of living increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:80">[07:33:80]</a>. However, there is a growing "tipping fatigue" among Canadians, leading many to push back against these higher expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:83">[07:35:83]</a>.

## No-Tipping Models and Service-Included Pricing
A notable development is the emergence of no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:25">[07:45:25]</a>. Some restaurants, including one in Vancouver, are abandoning tips entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:82">[07:47:82]</a>. Instead, they pay staff higher wages and integrate service costs directly into menu prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:75">[07:51:75]</a>. This approach offers a hassle-free experience for customers and is gaining traction, potentially leading to more establishments adopting European-style service-included pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:56">[07:56:56]</a>.

## The Impact of Technology
The widespread use of [[impact_of_digital_tipping_machines|digital tipping screens]] has made tipping a more public and often pressured experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:23">[08:07:23]</a>. This increased pressure could inadvertently accelerate the shift towards no-tipping models or, at the very least, encourage consumers to be more vocal about their preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:77">[08:10:77]</a>.

## Cultural Stubbornness
Despite these potential changes, tipping is deeply ingrained in [[evolution_of_tipping_culture_in_canada|Canadian culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:15">[08:19:15]</a>. It is often perceived as a means to reward good service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:92">[08:22:92]</a>. Therefore, it is unlikely to disappear entirely anytime soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:60">[08:24:60]</a>. The future will likely see a blend of rising tip expectations, more aggressive [[impact_of_digital_tipping_machines|tipping tech]], and experimental no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:10">[08:27:10]</a>.

## What This Means for Consumers
For consumers, the future of tipping in Canada means navigating a landscape with both traditional tipping and emerging no-tipping models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:58">[08:36:58]</a>. The decision of what works best ultimately rests with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:48">[08:40:48]</a>. While the current [[public_perception_of_tipping_in_canada|tipping culture]] and pressure are robust, the consumer's increasing vocalness may lead to more choice in how service is compensated in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:34">[08:45:34]</a>.

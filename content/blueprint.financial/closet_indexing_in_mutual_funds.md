[[Deceptive marketing tactics in the mutual fund industry | Closet indexing]] is described as one of the biggest "ripoffs" in the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It occurs when a mutual fund claims to be actively managed but, in practice, closely tracks a specific market index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Despite this passive approach, investors are charged the higher fees typically associated with actively managed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This means investors pay for expert decision-making without actually receiving it, getting similar returns to a cheaper ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Why it's a Problem
[[High fees associated with mutual funds | Closet indexing]] is problematic because investors pay high fees for what is essentially an index-tracking strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This leads to [[Mutual funds underperformance compared to benchmarks | underperformance]] compared to the benchmark once fees are factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Example: TD Canadian Equity Fund
The TD Canadian Equity Fund is cited as a "classic closet indexer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This $7.4 billion fund markets itself as actively managed, but its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Why TD Canadian Equity Fund Falls Short
*   **Underperforms the Index:** Over 10 years, this fund returned 6.87% annually, while the S&P TSX Composite Index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Excessive Fees:** It charges a Management Expense Ratio (MER) of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This significantly eats into returns compared to a low-cost Canadian index ETF like XIC, which has an MER of 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Low Active Share:** With a low turnover rate of 12%, the fund is not making significant trading decisions, yet it charges high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Investor Impact
An investor with $100,000 in the TD Canadian Equity Fund over 10 years missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains due to the fund trailing the index by 1.72% per year, all while paying steep management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Prevalence in Canada
Canada has a poor track record with [[Deceptive marketing tactics in the mutual fund industry | closet indexing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds are invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   A Morningstar study found that many actively managed mutual funds in Canada have low active share scores, meaning they barely deviate from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## How to Identify a Closet Indexer
Closet indexers will not admit they are expensive index funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Here are ways to identify them:
*   **Compare Holdings:** If a fund's stock allocations are nearly identical to a benchmark ETF, you're likely paying high fees for no added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Returns:** If a fund's performance moves in lockstep with an index but charges higher fees, it's highly likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Turnover Rate:** A low turnover rate (under 20%) suggests minimal trading and active decision-making, despite high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Tracking Error:** If a fund's returns closely match an index year-over-year, it's likely a closet indexer in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Alternatives to Avoid Closet Indexing
To avoid [[Closet indexing in mutual funds | closet indexing]] and its drawbacks, consider alternatives such as:
*   **[[Introduction to allinone ETFs | ETFs]]**: Generally have much lower MERs (starting at 0.05%) and can offer better [[Tax inefficiency of mutual funds in Canada | tax efficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. They often outperform mutual funds due to their low-fee approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors**: Automated investment platforms that provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **DIY Stock Investing**: For those willing to manage their own portfolio, investing directly in individual stocks and ETFs can be a lower-cost alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers**: Professional portfolio managers can provide customized strategies with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4%, often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

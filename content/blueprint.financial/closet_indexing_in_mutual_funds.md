[[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | Closet indexing]] is a significant issue within the [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual fund]] industry, representing a hidden cost that can quietly erode an investor's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It occurs when a [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual fund]] is marketed as actively managed but, in practice, closely mirrors a market index while still charging the high fees typically associated with active management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Investors are misled into believing they are paying for expert decision-making, when in reality, they are paying more for returns they could achieve with a much cheaper [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | ETF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## The Problem with Closet Indexing
The core issue with [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | closet indexing]] is the significant discrepancy between the fees charged and the value provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. It's akin to paying for a five-star chef at a Michelin restaurant but receiving a frozen TV dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This practice disproportionately benefits banks and fund managers through high fees, rather than providing investors with superior returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## Case Study: TD Canadian Equity Fund
The TD Canadian Equity Fund serves as a classic example of a [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | closet indexer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This fund, with $7.4 billion in assets under management, is marketed as actively managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. However, its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Key issues with this fund include:
*   **Underperformance** Over a 10-year period, the fund returned 6.87% annually, while the index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Excessive Fees** It charges a high Management Expense Ratio (MER) of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. In contrast, a low-cost Canadian index [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | ETF]] like XIC charges only 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Low Active Share** The fund has a low turnover rate of 12%, indicating that it isn't making significant, bold investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Despite this, it charges [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | high active management fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Over a decade, an investor with $100,000 in this fund could have missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains due to the fund trailing the index by 1.72% per year, all while paying steep management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | Closet Indexing in Canada]]
Canada has a notable history of [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | closet indexing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Research suggests that approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual funds]] are invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. A Morning Star study also found that many [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | actively managed mutual funds in Canada]] exhibit low active share scores, meaning they deviate minimally from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Identifying [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | Closet Indexers]]
Since [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | closet indexers]] will not openly admit to being expensive index funds, investors need to be proactive in identifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Here are key indicators:
*   **Compare Holdings to Benchmark [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | ETFs]]** If a fund's stock allocations are nearly identical to a benchmark [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_emutual_funds | ETF]], it suggests high fees are being paid for no added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Analyze Long-Term Returns** If a fund's performance consistently moves in lockstep with an index but charges [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | higher fees]], it is highly likely a [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | closet indexer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Check the Turnover Rate** A low turnover rate, typically under 20%, indicates minimal trading activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This suggests the fund is not making significant active decisions, yet charges high active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Tracking Error** If a fund's returns closely match the index year-over-year, it's likely a closet indexer in disguise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Alternative Investment Options
To avoid the pitfalls of [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | closet indexing]] and other issues prevalent in [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual funds]], investors should consider more transparent options with potentially lower fees:
*   **[[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | ETFs]]** Exchange-Traded Funds typically have much lower Management Expense Ratios (MERs), starting from 0.05%, offer better [[tax_inefficiencies_in_mutual_funds | tax efficiency]], and often outperform [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | mutual funds]] due to their low-fee approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors** Automated investment platforms provide diversified [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | ETF]] portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Fee-Only Financial Planners** These professionals prioritize investor interests and provide transparent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers** For those seeking active management with customized strategies, professional portfolio managers can offer services with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4%, often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Ultimately, investors should prioritize their financial future over loyalty to a bank or advisor and demand transparency in their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. [[tracking_and_managing_investment_performance | Tracking]] one's net worth and understanding [[risk_management_in_mutual_fund_investments | risk]] tolerance are also crucial for making informed investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

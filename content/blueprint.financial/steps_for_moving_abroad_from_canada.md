Many Canadians are considering [[reasons_for_leaving_canada | leaving Canada]] due to concerns like high taxes, inflation, and cold winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This sentiment is reflected in recent [[relocation_and_migration_trends_in_canada | migration trends]], with 126,340 Canadians moving to the U.S. alone in 2022, a 70% increase from 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It's estimated that approximately 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad in 2016, a number that has likely increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## [[reasons_for_leaving_canada | Why People Want to Leave Canada]]

The primary driver for Canadians considering a move abroad is the rising [[cost_of_living_comparison_in_canada_and_abroad | cost of living]], particularly the skyrocketing housing prices in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Other significant [[factors_to_consider_when_moving_abroad | factors to consider when moving abroad]] include:
*   **Affordable Living**: Moving to countries such as Mexico, Portugal, or parts of the United States can significantly reduce the [[cost_of_living_comparison_in_canada_and_abroad | cost of living]] due to more affordable housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These are examples of [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | affordable countries for Canadians to live abroad]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Milder Climates**: Canada's harsh winters, with temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, prompt many to seek warmer climates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Healthcare System Challenges**: Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces challenges such as long wait times for medical services and a low doctor-to-population ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Commonwealth Fund ranks Canada poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Adventure and Personal Growth**: Living abroad offers the opportunity for adventure, new experiences, and immersion in different cultures, cuisines, and ways of life, fostering personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Steps for Moving Abroad

### Step 1: Make Sure You Want to Leave Canada
Before making a permanent move, it's crucial to be certain about your decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A trial run can prevent future regrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

*   **Trial Run**: Spend a few weeks or months living in the country (or countries) you are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This hands-on experience allows you to assess if the lifestyle fits you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Try to live as much like a local as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Considerations**: During your trial, you might discover issues such as safety concerns, a closed-off culture making it difficult to form connections, or a newfound appreciation for aspects of Canadian life, including the healthcare system and social ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Step 2: Making Money Abroad
Unless you are financially independent, securing income is vital for living overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Here are three common paths, from easiest to hardest:

1.  **Expat through Company Transfer**:
    *   **Process**: Seek international opportunities within your current company and express interest to HR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Network with colleagues who have worked abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Offers job security, maintained benefits, and relocation assistance from the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. International experience can boost your career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Less flexibility over location, potential adaptation challenges to a new work culture, and often requires a longer commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

2.  **Remote Work**:
    *   **Process**: Find remote jobs on websites like remote.co, weworkremotely.com, and flexjobs.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Set up a home office with reliable internet and necessary tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Manage time effectively using tools like Trello or Asana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Flexibility to work from anywhere with an internet connection, eliminating daily commute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Can be isolating without an office social aspect, requires high self-motivation and time management, and may offer less job security and benefits than full-time employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Remote workers are often in software/IT, but also in HR, sales, and law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

3.  **Digital Nomad**:
    *   **Process**: Develop a marketable skill (e.g., freelance writing, graphic design, programming, consulting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Build an online portfolio and find clients on freelance websites like Upwork, Fiverr, and Freelancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   **Benefits**: Freedom to travel and experience new cultures, working for multiple clients can offer stability, and fosters personal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Unpredictable income, balancing work and travel, and navigating visas and work permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Many digital nomads eventually desire a home base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Digital nomads come from diverse fields, including digital marketing, startups, content creation, and therapy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Step 3: Understanding How to Become a Non-Resident of Canada
To become a non-resident of Canada for tax purposes, you must sever significant residential ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Severing Ties**: This includes selling your home, closing Canadian bank accounts, and relocating your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The most significant factor is where you spend your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Documentation**: Keep documentation of your new residency status, such as rental agreements and utility bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Departure Tax**: Be aware of the departure tax, which applies to the deemed disposition of certain properties as if they were sold on your departure date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. You'll need to pay tax on unrealized gains from investments and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   **Exemptions**: RRSPs, RIFs, and certain real estate are exempt from this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. You must report these deemed dispositions on your final tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Financial Accounts**:
    *   **TFSA**: Your TFSA can remain open, but you cannot make contributions while a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Earnings within it remain tax-free in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   **RRSP/RIF**: You can keep your RRSP and RIF accounts, but withdrawals will be subject to a 25% withholding tax, which may be reduced by tax treaties with your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   **[[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_living_abroad | CPP Benefits for Canadians Living Abroad]]**: You can continue receiving [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_living_abroad | CPP payments]] abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   **OAS**: You are eligible to receive OAS payments outside of Canada if you lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Step 4: Understanding Your New Country's Rules
Figuring out the rules of your new country can be challenging, especially with potential distance and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. A smooth transition requires understanding several key aspects:

*   **Residency and Tax Laws**: Research residency requirements, including applying for temporary or permanent residence permits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Some countries require address registration upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Understand what makes you a tax resident and investigate tax treaties with Canada to avoid double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Visa Laws**: Understand different visa options and choose the one that fits your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Familiarize yourself with required documents, timelines, conditions (e.g., restrictions on work, study), and renewal procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Learn how to open a local bank account by choosing a reputable bank and preparing necessary documents like your passport, visa, and proof of address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Understand the local currency, exchange rates, and banking system to ensure access to your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Other Important Regulations**:
    *   **Healthcare**: Research the local healthcare system and whether you need to purchase health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   **Driving**: Understand local driving laws and requirements, including the need for international driving permits or converting your Canadian license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   **Legal Requirements**: Learn about local laws and emergency services to avoid legal issues and ensure safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Step 5: Explore Getting Citizenship Elsewhere
Securing citizenship in a new country offers benefits like stability, access to local services, and full integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

*   **Citizenship by Naturalization**: This common method usually involves living and working in a country for a specific period (e.g., 5 years in Germany) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Requires continuous residency, compliance with local laws, and often a language test or cultural integration demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Investment**: Some countries grant citizenship in exchange for significant financial investments (e.g., Turkey offers citizenship for real estate purchase of at least $400,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Requires the investment, proof of funds, and meeting additional residency or legal requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Citizenship by Relatives and Ancestry**: If you have parents, grandparents, or even great-grandparents from another country, you might be eligible for citizenship by descent (e.g., Italian citizenship with Italian ancestry, Irish citizenship with an Irish grandparent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This process typically involves gathering relevant certificates (birth, marriage) and submitting them to the consulate or embassy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Other Ways**: Marrying a citizen of another country can often expedite the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Some countries, like the UAE, grant citizenship for exceptional skills in fields like science or culture, usually involving nomination or demonstrating contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

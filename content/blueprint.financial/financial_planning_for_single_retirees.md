Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represents 37.8%, or almost four out of every ten Canadians in this age group, who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Retiring solo significantly changes the approach to [[strategies_for_effective_retirement_planning | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Average Retirement Income in Canada

The average retirement income in Canada is often lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older is:
*   **For couples**: $74,200 per year, or about $6,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   **For single seniors**: $30,820 per year, or approximately $2,568 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This is significantly lower than couples' income, less than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Biggest Risks for Single Retirees and How to Manage Them

Retiring alone presents unique [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | financial challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Without a partner to share costs, benefits, or provide a safety net, every dollar becomes more critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Single individuals may face higher taxes, fewer government supports, and greater pressure to manage their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, with smart [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | planning]], a comfortable retirement is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### 1. Running Out of Money: Longevity and Investment Risk

The fear of running out of money is the number one concern in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Unlike couples who share expenses and benefit from tax savings, singles must cover all costs alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This makes running out of money a greater risk for single retirees because they lack a partner's pension or extra savings and typically need more savings to maintain the same lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

**Strategies for managing this risk:**
*   **Sustainable Withdrawal Rate**: Follow benchmarks like the 4% rule, but single retirees might need to adjust it lower based on market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Diversify Investments**: A mix of growth investments (stocks) and safety (bonds and GICs) helps ensure funds last longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Careful [[financial_planning_for_retirement | Retirement Financial Planning]]**: Working with a financial planner to build a customized strategy based on lifestyle, savings, and risk tolerance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Every decision, from when to take CPP to withdrawal amounts, matters more when on your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### 2. Higher Tax Burden

Being single often means paying more in taxes in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Without access to income splitting or spousal benefits, single retirees frequently fall into higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income, simply because the couple could split income and both qualify for full OAS and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

**Strategies for managing this risk:**
*   **Strategic Withdrawals**: How and when money is withdrawn from RRSP, TFSA, CPP, and OAS can significantly impact the amount kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Smart timing and draw-down strategies can save thousands in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### 3. Inflation and Rising Costs

Inflation is a silent wealth killer, eroding purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. As a single retiree, there's no one to share the burden of rising costs for groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Therefore, planning for inflation is essential to ensure money lasts through a retirement that could span 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

**Creative ways retirees are fighting inflation:**
*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space**: Unlocking equity in their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Co-living or House Hacking**: Sharing living spaces with friends or other retirees to cut fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Moving to Lower-Cost Areas**: Relocating to provinces or countries with lower living expenses to stretch every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This movement is gaining popularity for [[financial_planning_for_international_retirement | international retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### 4. No Survivor Benefits: Lack of Financial Safety Net

A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the absence of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there's no automatic rollover for RRSPs, RIFs, or pensions upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, potentially leading to a massive tax hit on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited or no support for single retirees, reducing guaranteed income options for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

**Strategies to protect what has been built:**
*   **Careful RRSP/RIF Withdrawals**: Gradual withdrawals rather than delaying too long can help reduce the final tax burden on the estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Regular Beneficiary Review**: Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance designations are up-to-date so assets go as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 5. Less Social and Emotional Support

Loneliness in retirement isn't just a social issue; it carries financial risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Studies indicate single retirees are more prone to depression, cognitive decline, and financial scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Scammers frequently target older adults who live alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

**Strategies to stay connected and protected:**
*   **Join Community Groups**: Volunteering, social clubs, and classes promote engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Consider Co-living**: Senior co-housing or shared housing cuts costs and fosters friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Utilize Technology for Safety**: Features like Apple Watch fall detection, wellness check-ins, and fraud alerts can provide protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 6. [[health_and_longterm_care_costs_for_single_retirees | Health and Long-Term Care Costs]]

For single retirees, there is no built-in caregiver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Healthcare costs accumulate rapidly, and single individuals face higher long-term care expenses than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Home care**: Typically ranges from $25 to $50 per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Assisted living**: Can range from $3,000 to $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Nursing home (government subsidized)**: Between $2,000 and $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Private care**: Can exceed $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

**Strategies to plan for health costs:**
*   **Budget for Care**: Maintain a reserve fund or explore long-term care insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Assign Power of Attorney**: Designate a trusted individual to make medical and financial decisions if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Consider Disability and Critical Illness Insurance**: These policies can help cover major medical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Why Planning Matters: A Case Study (Andy Dwire)

To illustrate the importance of detailed [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | financial planning for Canadian retirees]], consider Andy Dwire, a single retiree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

**Andy's Initial Situation**:
*   **Age**: 65, planning to retire this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Estimated Spending**: Believes he'll need $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Assets**: $200,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Estimated Return**: 5% in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Other Income**: No pension, no spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Health**: Good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Initial Plan**: Take CPP and OAS immediately at age 65, aiming for money to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Mistake #1: Not Accounting for Inflation

Andy initially overlooked inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. With a 2.1% inflation rate, his perceived $50,000 annual spending would become $55,000 by age 70 and $61,000 by age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This meant his purchasing power would drop, and his money would run out much earlier, around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Mistake #2: Overestimating Spending (Works in His Favor)

Most people overestimate their retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. In reality, spending often drops by about 20% upon retirement and further declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Revised Spending Estimate for Andy**:
    *   $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
This adjustment extends Andy's savings to age 85, a significant improvement from age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. His goal progress jumped from 54% to 94% with this change alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Delaying CPP and OAS

Andy's initial plan was to take CPP ($10,000) and OAS ($8,700) at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. By delaying these benefits until age 70, his CPP increased to $17,000 and OAS to $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This delay meant his shortfall began at age 88 instead of 84, making his plan fully funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Smoothing Out Taxes (RRSP Meltdown)

Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA, which is not taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. To smooth out taxes and optimize his plan, Andy began withdrawing $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This helped cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

This strategy brought his plan to 102% funded and resulted in a smooth, low effective tax rate (2-3%) until age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. There was no shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Building More Buffer

While 102% funded is good, adding a buffer can provide more comfort in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Here are three options for Andy:

1.  **Work One Extra Year**: By working one additional year, earning his current $80,000 salary, his plan became 114% funded, providing a nice buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Part-time Woodworking Hobby**: Andy's passion for woodworking could generate an estimated $10,000 a year for six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This would bring his goal progress to 112% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb His Condo in Summer**: Since Andy often lives with family during summer, he could rent out his condo for an estimated $10,000 a year for six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This option also would result in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Andy preferred options two or three as he did not want to work another year, emphasizing that every year in retirement is crucial, and it's best to start retirement sustainably as quickly as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

This detailed approach involves stress-testing the plan against various scenarios like market downturns, higher inflation, or unexpected [[health_and_longterm_care_costs_for_single_retirees | long-term care costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The goal is to refine the plan until the retiree has a clear roadmap and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

While [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | retirement as a single person in Canada]] can be challenging, it doesn't have to be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. With the right [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | planning]], individuals can maximize their financial resources, avoid significant tax burdens, and achieve the retirement they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

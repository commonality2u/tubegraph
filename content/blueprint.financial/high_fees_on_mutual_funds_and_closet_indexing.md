"Silent wealth killers" can quietly drain the potential of a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "termites" silently eat away at an investment's foundation, causing permanent damage over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Ridiculously High Fees

[[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | High fees]] are considered one of the sneakiest ways to kill TFSA potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Former financial advisors at major Canadian banks note that institutions use "little tricks" to obscure the exact amount of fees investors pay annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Canada is known for having some of the [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | highest mutual fund fees]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. According to a Morningstar report, the average Management Expense Ratio (MER) for Canadian Equity Funds is 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Major banks like TD, RBC, and CIBC commonly offer funds with MERs exceeding 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Underperformance Due to High Fees

A significant issue is that 93.4% of Canadian Equity Funds [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformed]] their benchmarks over the last 10 years, which is likely due to these [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## Closet Indexing

A particularly "sinister" practice by many of these funds is engaging in what is called [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

> [01:16:00] They charge High fees for so-called active management but essentially mimic the index they're trying to outperform in addition to taking a huge fee in return

This means investors pay high fees for "active management" but receive performance that closely mirrors a passive index fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Case Study: RBC vs. Vanguard VFV

[[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | A comparison of two funds]] using the S&P 500 as a benchmark illustrates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>:
*   **RBC US Equity Fund**: Claims to be actively managed and charges a 1.88% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Vanguard VFV**: A low-cost, passive ETF with a 0.09% MER that tracks the index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

The RBC fund has [[mutual_funds_and_underperformance | underperformed]] VFV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. The performance of the RBC fund closely mirrors the index fund, which is a classic sign of [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

Over a 5-year period:
*   **Vanguard VFV**: Had a 116% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. An initial $100,000 investment would have grown to $216,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.
*   **RBC US Equity Fund**: Had an 88% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. The same $100,000 would have only grown to $188,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

This represents a significant difference of $38,000 in just 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Impact of High Fees on Investment Returns

The [[impact_of_high_fees_on_investment_returns | compounded losses due to fees]] over a 20 to 30-year timeframe could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars lost in tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This money could have remained in the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

A $4 billion RBC fund with an almost 2% MER collects nearly $80 million annually in fees from Canadian investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. There are thousands of [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high-fee funds]] in Canada that siphon billions of dollars from Canadian TFSAs each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

Many Canadians believe that [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, relying heavily on these benefits alone can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article provides a breakdown of OAS, what to expect, and its role in [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | retirement income]].

## What is Old Age Security (OAS)?

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>. To be eligible, an individual must have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:58">[01:57:58]</a>.

Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), OAS is not based on employment income or work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency, income, and whether payments are deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.

### OAS Payment Details

As of March 2025, the maximum monthly OAS payments are:
*   **Ages 65 to 74**: Approximately $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.
*   **Ages 75 and older**: Jumps by 10% to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>.

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, and October) and adjusted based on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. An automatic 10% increase is applied to the OAS pension at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>.

### Maximizing OAS Benefits

Similar to CPP, [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying OAS payments]] can significantly boost your benefits. Waiting to collect OAS until age 70 can increase benefits by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:34">[07:32:34]</a>. However, individuals need to be able to afford delaying these payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:36">[01:34:36]</a>. For more information on this, see [[strategies_for_maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Strategies for Maximizing CPP and OAS Benefits]].

### Impact on Other Benefits

If your total income is very low, you may qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>. Notably, OAS payments do not count towards the GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:26">[03:23:26]</a>.

For a single senior with no other income, the maximum GIS for 2024 is $900 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:54">[02:52:54]</a>. However, GIS is reduced dollar for dollar if you have any additional income, even small withdrawals from RRSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. For instance, a hypothetical total monthly income could include $800 from CPP, $700 from OAS, and $500 from GIS, for a total of $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:10">[03:10:10]</a>.

## Life on OAS and Other Benefits

Relying solely on OAS, CPP, and GIS can be challenging, as the combined income may be barely above the poverty line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:28">[03:28:28]</a>. Living on $1,500 to $2,000 per month in Canada requires serious sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:01">[03:57:01]</a>.

Expenses can quickly consume these benefits:
*   **Housing**: Even with an owned home, property taxes, maintenance, and utilities can exceed $500 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:14">[04:08:14]</a>. Renting can cost $1,000 or more in smaller cities, and over $2,000 in major cities like Toronto or Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:32">[04:18:32]</a>.
*   **Food**: A basic grocery budget for a single senior ranges from $300 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:40">[04:34:40]</a>.
*   **Other Costs**: Healthcare (prescriptions, dental, vision), utilities, and transportation can add hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:06">[04:44:06]</a>.

A lifestyle on these benefits would likely include no travel budget, no major purchases, and living month-to-month, with reliance on family or community support for unexpected bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:28">[05:10:28]</a>.

### When Relying on OAS Might Work

While challenging, living primarily on OAS and CPP might be possible if:
*   **You own your home outright**: Eliminating mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:06">[06:01:06]</a>. Options include borrowing against the home or downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:09">[06:08:09]</a>.
*   **You live in a low-cost area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:18">[06:14:18]</a>.
*   **You share housing costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:26">[06:21:26]</a>.
*   **You have extra support**: Help from family, investment income, or a part-time job makes a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:33">[06:27:33]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree in small-town Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work with strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:44">[06:35:44]</a>.

### When It Falls Apart

For most retirees, relying solely on OAS and CPP does not provide a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:50">[06:46:50]</a>. Major city costs of living and unexpected expenses like medical bills or car repairs can quickly derail finances, leaving no safety net <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:09">[06:51:09]</a>.

### Strategies Beyond OAS

If OAS and CPP alone are not enough, consider:
*   **Delaying OAS**: As mentioned, [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying OAS payments]] until age 70 increases them by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:34">[07:25:34]</a>.
*   **Part-time work or delaying retirement**: Working longer or part-time can provide supplementary income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:46">[07:37:46]</a>.
*   **Lowering housing costs**: Downsizing or relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or even abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:56">[07:47:56]</a>. For considerations when moving abroad, see [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | OAS eligibility and taxes when retiring overseas]].
*   **Government benefits**: Exploring programs like the Allowance for the Survivor for additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:02">[07:58:02]</a>.
*   **Fiscal planning**: Utilizing strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies to lower tax burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:12">[08:04:12]</a>.
*   **Creative income strategies**: Some retirees rent out parts of their home, turn hobbies into income, or engage in work-for-stay arrangements and nomadic retirement in low-cost countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:52">[08:13:52]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal offer a higher quality of life for the same income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:32">[09:30:32]</a>.

It is crucial to have a backup plan beyond solely relying on OAS and CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:47">[09:44:47]</a>. The sooner retirement planning begins, the more options become available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:56">[09:48:56]</a>.

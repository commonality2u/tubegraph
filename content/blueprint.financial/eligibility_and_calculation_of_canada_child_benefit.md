The [[canada_child_benefit_explained | Canada Child Benefit (CCB)]] is a significant program designed to assist Canadian families with the [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising children]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It can provide substantial financial support, potentially covering a large portion of the expenses associated with raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)?

The CCB is a tax-free payment provided to families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Key features of the CCB include:
*   **Indexed to Inflation**: The benefit amount increases over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Flexible Spending**: There are no restrictions on how the CCB money can be spent; it can be used for food, housing, education, or other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Potential Benefit Amounts

The CCB can provide substantial support over a child's upbringing.
*   The average [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising a child]] in Canada from birth to age 17 is estimated at $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The CCB can provide up to $125,500 per child, tax-free, over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

Here's how maximum annual CCB payments break down over 18 years for one child if you qualify for the maximum amount:
*   **Kids under six**: Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,668 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Kids age six to 17**: The annual maximum is $6,570, adding up to $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Total over 18 years**: This totals up to $125,508 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

There is no limit to the number of children for whom you can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   One child: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Two children: Doubles to about $251,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Three children: Averages $376,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   For a large family with 18 children, over $2.2 million in CCB payments could be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The CCB can cover a significant portion of the [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising a child]], especially for lower-income families.
*   The average [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising a child]] is around $17,235 per year for a two-parent, middle-income family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Families earning over $135,000 annually may spend more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   Families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising a child]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## How to Qualify for the CCB

Eligibility for the CCB is primarily based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   If you are married or in a common-law relationship, your AFNI is the combined income of both spouses, minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   As your net income increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   Families with lower incomes receive the full benefit, while higher-income families will see reduced payments or none at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## CCB Calculation and Reduction

The CCB amount decreases as your family's net income rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The reduction occurs in two stages:
1.  **First Reduction Stage**: If your AFNI is between $34,863 and $73,756, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $34,863 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Second Reduction Stage**: If your AFNI is above $73,756, an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over $73,756, after the initial reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Example for One Child Under Six
*   **Income $35,000 or less**: Receive the full benefit of $7,777 per year, or $649 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Income at $50,000**: The annual benefit is reduced to about $6,840, or $570 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Income at $100,000**: The annual benefit drops to approximately $2,776, or $231 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Income at $130,000**: The benefit further reduces to about $1,814 per year, or $151 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   At very high-income levels, the benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

For exact numbers, especially with multiple children, the CRA's CCB calculator is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## How to Get Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward:
*   The CRA automatically calculates your payments once you file your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   No extra application is needed, as long as you and your partner file taxes annually and your child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Filing your taxes also enables access to other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   For faster payments, set up direct deposit with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   CCB payment dates are typically between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Important Tips
*   **Keep Information Updated**: If your family's income changes due to job loss, marriage, birth of a new baby, or divorce, update the CRA right away to potentially qualify for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Shared Custody**: Inform the CRA about changes in shared custody arrangements, as payments are typically split 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of the CCB

The [[canada_child_benefit_explained | CCB]] is a crucial tool in reducing [[impact_of_canada_child_benefit_on_child_poverty | child poverty]] and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   In 2021 alone, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to tackle declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising kids and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Making the most of the CCB is one way to improve your [[financial_planning_with_canada_child_benefit | financial outlook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

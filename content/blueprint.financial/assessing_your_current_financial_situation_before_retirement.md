## Key Components of Assessment

To gain a comprehensive understanding of your finances, you should track all your:
*   **Assets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   **Liabilities** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
*   **Income Sources** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>

This process is like creating a "financial selfie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Case Study: Pam and Jim Helper

The [[case_studies_on_financial_planning_for_retirees | financial planning case study]] of Pam and Jim Helper highlights the importance of this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Through their assessment, they discovered they had substantial savings distributed across various accounts, including:
*   RSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>
*   TFSAs (Tax-Free Savings Accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

Their diligent tracking revealed a steady increase in their total net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. By their planned retirement age of 65, their combined net worth impressively exceeded $1.7 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This meticulous tracking allowed them to be overfunded for retirement, exceeding their goals by 9% with a surplus of $64,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Tools and Strategies

If you are unsure where to begin with tracking your finances, consider using tools such as:
*   Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   Quicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

Another beneficial strategy, as demonstrated by Pam and Jim, is to consolidate your accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This can help minimize fees and simplify financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

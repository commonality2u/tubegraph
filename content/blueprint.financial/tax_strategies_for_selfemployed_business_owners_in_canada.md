Being self-employed in Canada offers unique opportunities to save on taxes, helping to protect and grow your net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This applies to traditional business owners as well as those in the gig economy, such as Uber drivers or DoorDash deliverers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Key Strategies for Self-Employed Tax Planning

### Claiming Business Expenses

Running a business involves costs, many of which are tax deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Deductible expenses can include:
*   Office supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>
*   Marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>
*   Business travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>
*   Professional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>
*   A portion of vehicle expenses if used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>

For example, if you earn $80,000 annually but claim $20,000 in business expenses, your taxable income drops to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. At a 30% tax rate, this results in $6,000 in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This illustrates why a dollar of self-employed income is often considered more valuable than a dollar of employee income due to the significant tax write-offs available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Home Office Deductions

If you work from home, you may be able to claim a percentage of your household expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. These expenses include:
*   Rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>
*   Utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   Property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>

The deductible percentage is based on the amount of space in your home used for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. For example, if your home office occupies 10% of your home and your annual household expenses total $30,000, you could claim a $3,000 deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. At a 30% tax rate, this saves you $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Hiring a Family Member

Hiring a spouse or family member to assist with your business allows you to pay them a reasonable salary for their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. This strategy effectively shifts income to someone in a lower tax bracket, resulting in overall family tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

For instance, if you earn $100,000 at a 35% tax rate and pay your spouse $30,000 at a 20% tax rate, your taxable income drops to $70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This results in $10,500 in tax savings for you, while your spouse pays $6,000 in taxes on their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. The net family tax savings would be $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

It is crucial that the salary paid to a family member is reasonable for the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. The CRA is very strict on this rule; for example, paying $100,000 for basic data entry would not be considered reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

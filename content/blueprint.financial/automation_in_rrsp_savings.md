Many Canadians have built significant [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]]s by following key principles, one of which involves using automation to "trick" oneself into saving more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:04">[06:16:04]</a>. Rather than relying solely on discipline and willpower, the approach focuses on making saving effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:05">[06:21:05]</a>.

## Strategies for Effortless Saving

RSP millionaires employ several automation techniques:

*   **Pre-authorized Contributions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:37">[06:31:37]</a>: They set up automatic [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP contributions]] to occur on payday, preventing the money from being spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:47">[06:33:47]</a>.
*   **Automatic Annual Increases** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>: Contributions are automatically increased by a set percentage (e.g., 1%) each year, allowing savings to grow without conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:05">[06:40:05]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting Tax Refunds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:17">[06:46:17]</a>: Instead of spending [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] tax refunds on non-essentials, these individuals reinvest them, potentially adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to their portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
*   **Utilizing Free Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>:
    *   **Employer Matching** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>: They consistently take full advantage of employer [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP]] matching programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:36">[07:04:36]</a>.
    *   **Spousal RRSPs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:54">[07:05:54]</a>: These are used to help balance taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:14">[07:08:14]</a>.
    *   **Deduction Carry Forwards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:04">[07:10:04]</a>: Claims are made when they offer the most tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:39">[07:11:39]</a>.

## The Benefit of Automation

Consider two individuals:
*   **James**, who tries to save manually, often forgets or finds other uses for the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:09">[07:17:09]</a>.
*   **Sophie**, who automates all her [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions | RRSP contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:07">[07:27:07]</a>.

At retirement age, Sophie is significantly wealthier because she removed human error from the saving equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

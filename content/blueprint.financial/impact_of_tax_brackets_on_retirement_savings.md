Canadian retirees often make a common mistake by not properly managing their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) withdrawals, which can lead to leaving money on the table due to unnecessary taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. By strategically converting RSP funds to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), retirees can significantly reduce their tax bill, boost tax-free growth, and enjoy a more comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This approach helps in [[managing_higher_tax_burden_in_retirement | managing higher tax burden in retirement]] by keeping more money in the retiree's possession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Wasted TFSA Room in Retirement

A significant issue among retirees is the wasted TFSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While 17.77% of Canadians hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) manage to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This indicates that the vast majority are missing out on the incredible tax-free growth potential offered by the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Many retirees enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, among 1.56 million TFSA holders aged 60 to 64, only 9.48% maximize their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases with age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before dropping slightly to 14% for those 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## The Challenge: Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are excellent for saving during working years, but they come with obligations in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Every dollar withdrawn from an RSP is considered taxable income, which can push retirees into a higher [[federal_tax_brackets | tax bracket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

At age 71, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) requires individuals to convert their RSP into a Registered Income Fund (RIF) and begin mandatory withdrawals, regardless of whether the money is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This mandatory withdrawal can significantly increase a retiree's taxable income.

## The RSP-to-TFSA Strategy

The strategy involves withdrawing excess funds from your RIF (or RSP) and contributing them into your TFSA, where they can be invested and grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This can save thousands of dollars in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RIF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The CRA mandates a $30,000 annual withdrawal, which is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

*   **Tax Impact:** If Eddie is in a 30% tax bracket, he owes $9,000 in tax on the withdrawal, leaving him with $21,000 after-tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Excess Funds:** Eddie only needs $11,000 of the withdrawal for living expenses, as his Canada Pension Plan (CPP), Old Age Security (OAS) benefits, and work pensions cover most of his costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This leaves him with $10,000 of excess RIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Traditional Approach:** Many people would place this excess income into a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Approach:** Instead, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Assuming a 6% annual growth rate:

*   **TFSA Growth:** After 10 years, Eddie contributes $100,000 to his TFSA, and it grows to approximately $132,000, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Non-Registered Account Comparison:** If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, with 30% of gains lost to taxes each year (an effective tax rate of 4% on returns), his account would grow to approximately $120,000 after 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Savings Account Comparison:** In a taxable savings account earning only 1%, the growth would be much lower, potentially around $55,000 after 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways

By contributing excess RIF income to his TFSA, Eddie saves approximately $12,000 in taxes over 10 years by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. His TFSA balance grows to $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account, or significantly less in a savings account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This approach maximizes retirement savings and offers flexibility to use TFSA funds for future needs or allow them to continue compounding tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Note that the $10,000 figure used in the example is for simplicity; individual contribution amounts will vary based on available TFSA room and personal circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Pro Tip:** Always prioritize contributing to your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have available TFSA room. This allows your money to grow tax-free instead of losing a portion of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Additionally, avoid withdrawing large RSP amounts in years where you already have high income, such as from the sale of property or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Does this strategy eliminate RSP taxes on withdrawal?

No, this strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on your RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. RSP withdrawals are still considered taxable income and are subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP withdrawals with TFSA withdrawals, you can reduce your overall taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The key is to minimize the tax impact while maximizing your overall retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

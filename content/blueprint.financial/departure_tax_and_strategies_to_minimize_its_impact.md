When leaving Canada, individuals may face a "departure tax," also known as an "exit tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">00:02:28</a>. This tax treats certain assets as if they were sold at their fair market value on the day of departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">00:02:33</a>. This can trigger capital gains tax, even if no actual sale has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">00:02:39</a>.

## Assets Subject to Departure Tax

The following assets may be subject to departure tax upon leaving Canada:
*   Stocks and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">00:02:46</a>.
*   Private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">00:02:50</a>.
*   Foreign real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">00:02:51</a>.

## Assets Not Subject to Departure Tax

Certain assets are exempt from departure tax:
*   Canadian real estate owned personally, which is only taxable when sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">00:02:55</a>.
*   Registered accounts, such as Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">00:03:02</a>. However, contributions to these accounts are not permitted after leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">00:03:05</a>.

## Example of Departure Tax in Action

Consider Alex, a Canadian resident moving permanently to Portugal and severing tax ties with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">00:03:10</a>.

**Assets Subject to Departure Tax:**
*   Stocks in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">00:03:18</a>
*   Private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">00:03:21</a>

**Assets Exempt from Departure Tax:**
*   TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">00:03:26</a>
*   RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">00:03:27</a>
*   Employer pension plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">00:03:28</a>
*   Canadian home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">00:03:29</a>

When Alex leaves Canada, the CRA considers his stocks and private company shares as if they were sold at fair market value, triggering capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">00:03:33</a>.

| Asset                 | Capital Gain |
| :-------------------- | :----------- |
| Stocks                | $80,000      |
| Private Company Shares| $200,000     |
| **Total**             | **$280,000** |

*   **Total Capital Gains:** $280,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">00:03:42</a>
*   **Taxable Capital Gain (50% inclusion):** $140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">00:03:50</a>
*   **Departure Tax (at 27% tax rate):** $37,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">00:03:54</a>

## Strategies to Reduce or Defer Departure Tax

Individuals can employ several [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | strategies to reduce or defer taxes]] before leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">00:04:03</a>:

*   **Selling Assets Before Departure:** Consider selling assets prior to leaving Canada to avoid the deemed disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">00:04:07</a>. This is particularly effective if you anticipate your departure a couple of years in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">00:04:12</a>.
*   **Utilizing Capital Losses:** Use available capital losses to offset any taxable capital gains triggered by the deemed disposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">00:04:15</a>.
*   **Gifting or Transferring Assets:** Assets can be gifted or transferred to family members before leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">00:04:20</a>.
*   **Deferring Departure Tax:** It is possible to defer departure tax if there are plans to return to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">00:04:24</a>.

## Related Tax Considerations

Properly establishing tax residency is fundamental to avoiding unexpected tax liabilities, including potential departure tax. The CRA determines tax residency based on significant residential ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">00:00:38</a>. Failing to sever these ties, or not establishing residency in a new country, could mean you are still considered a Canadian tax resident and liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">00:00:43</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">00:08:45</a>.

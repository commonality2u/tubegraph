Canada is experiencing a significant [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living crisis]], leading many residents to consider relocation both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phenomenon affects a wide range of the population, from recent immigrants to long-time residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Drivers of Relocation

The primary driver for Canadians considering relocation is the soaring cost of living, particularly in housing and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Rising Cost of Everyday Items**:
    *   A basket of 18 household items, which cost $82 in March 2021, increased to $113.32 today (July 2024), a 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   The average family of four's annual food bill is predicted to increase by about $71 this year, totaling $6,295, following a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   Food prices have consistently outpaced the average rate of inflation in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Rental and Housing Costs**:
    *   The average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver increased by 40% from $2,598 per month in April 2021 to $3,648 per month in July 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   The average cost to buy a house in Canada skyrocketed by 69.3% over the past nine years, from $413,000 in 2015 to $699,000 in May 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Stagnant Incomes**:
    *   Income growth has not kept pace with the rising cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   The median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals decreased from $73,000 in 2021 to $70,500 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Average wages have likely not increased sufficiently in 2023 or 2024 to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Migration Trends Among Specific Groups

### Recent Immigrants
A shocking 40% of recent immigrants are considering moving to another province or [[reasons_for_leaving_canada | leaving Canada]] entirely, primarily due to the high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### General Canadian Population
Approximately 28% of all Canadians are contemplating leaving their current province because of high housing costs, with young adults and renters being the most inclined to move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This trend is particularly evident in Ontario and British Columbia, where high housing costs have been a persistent issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Interprovincial Migration

### Popular Relocation Spots
Alberta has emerged as a popular destination for those considering an interprovincial move, with 18% of potential movers looking there due to more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### Major City Out-Migration
Between 2022 and 2023, the net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Addressing the High Cost of Living

While there are no easy fixes due to uncontrollable economic factors, individuals can focus on managing what they can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Strategies broadly fall into two categories: earning more money and spending less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Earning More Money
*   **Lower Income Earners**: Focus on starting a side hustle (e.g., freelance writing, Uber, DoorDash, Etsy store), investing in skill development through free or low-cost online courses (e.g., Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, Udemy), and constantly searching for better-paying job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Middle Income Earners**: Concentrate on career advancement within their current company, obtaining additional qualifications or certificates, and exploring passive income opportunities like investments or rental properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Higher Income Earners**: Leverage investments (stocks, real estate), consider business ventures, or offer consulting services based on their expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Spending Less Money
*   **Lower Income Earners**: Utilize government assistance programs (e.g., food banks, emergency shelters, utility bill assistance), create and stick to a strict budget, focus on reducing major expenses (food, shelter, transportation), and negotiate bills for services like cable and internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Middle Income Earners**: Prioritize debt management to reduce high-interest debt, practice smart shopping by using coupons and cashback offers, and evaluate lifestyle choices to identify areas for cutbacks (e.g., dining out less) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Higher Income Earners**: Engage in tax planning with a financial advisor, be mindful of luxury spending, and set up automatic transfers to savings and investment accounts to ensure consistent contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Out-of-the-Box Solutions

For those seeking more drastic changes, alternative living arrangements or international [[steps_for_moving_abroad_from_canada | relocation]] can offer significant cost savings:
*   **Tiny Houses**: A growing trend in Canada involves living in compact homes (200-400 sq ft) to save on housing costs and embrace a minimalist lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Companies like Mint Tiny House Company in Vancouver and Minimalist Houses in Quebec offer such options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Digital Nomads**: With the rise of remote work, individuals can reduce living expenses by [[steps_for_moving_abroad_from_canada | moving abroad]] to [[affordable_countries_for_canadians_to_live_abroad | affordable locations abroad]] like Thailand, Portugal, or Mexico, either temporarily or part-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This approach can lead to [[cost_of_living_comparison_in_canada_and_abroad | spending way less money than I would have if I had lived in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Despite these challenges, there remains hope for improved economic conditions and effective government solutions, with inflation showing signs of cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

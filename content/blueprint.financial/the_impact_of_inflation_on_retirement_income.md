For many Canadians, what should be a time for relaxation in retirement is becoming a growing financial crisis, characterized by falling retiree incomes and [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | rising inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This raises concerns about whether a comfortable retirement is still achievable on an average income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## The Reality of Retiree Income in Canada

[[the_reality_of_retiree_income_in_canada | The average retiree income in Canada]] is lower than often anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadians aged 65 and older was:
*   **Couples**: $74,200 per year ($6,183 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>
*   **Single Seniors**: $30,820 per year ($2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

For context, the median income across all age groups in Canada is approximately $95,000 for couples and $33,000 for single individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This indicates that many retirees are living on significantly less than the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, making comfortable retirement challenging amidst [[cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirement | rising costs]] for housing, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Surging Inflation

Retirement income is not merely stagnating but actively losing purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Between 2020 and 2022, senior couples saw their median after-tax income decrease by 1.4%, from $76,860 to $74,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Single retirees experienced a 1.2% decrease, from $32,720 to $30,820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Concurrently, [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]] surged by approximately 10%, increasing the cost of essential goods like groceries, gas, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Even with seemingly stable incomes, [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]] acts as a "silent tax," eroding financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
> [!quote] The Leaky Bucket Analogy
> Think of inflation as a leaky bucket: no matter how much water (money) you pour in, it keeps leaking out, eroding your purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Why Average Retirement Incomes Are Dropping

Several [[factors_affecting_retirement_spending | key factors]] contribute to the decline in average retirement incomes:
*   **Weaker Pensions**: Fewer employers offer guaranteed pensions, shifting financial risk onto retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **[[challenges_faced_by_retirees_in_saving_for_retirement | Savings Shortfalls]]**: Wages have not kept pace with [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]], making it harder for individuals to accumulate sufficient retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Years of Low Interest Rates**: Before recent increases, bonds and savings accounts offered minimal returns, forcing retirees to take on more risk or withdraw more than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **[[impacts_of_increased_life_expectancy_on_retirement | Longer Retirements]]**: Canadians are living longer, meaning savings must last for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This underscores the importance of smart planning to avoid outliving savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Comparing Retiree Incomes

Not all retirees are in the same financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   A senior couple earning above $74,200 per year is in the top 50% of retiree households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   For single seniors, earning above $30,820 per year places them in the upper half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Single retirees often face a much tougher financial situation than couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While their overall needs may be less, their costs do not scale down proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Single individuals might spend 60-80% of a household's expenses but often have 50% or less of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This is due to:
*   **[[home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_retirement | Housing Costs]]**: Rent or [[home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_retirement | home maintenance costs]] are often the same whether single or part of a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Food and Utilities**: Couples can share grocery and utility expenses, whereas a single retiree covers everything alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Expenses**: Certain medical and insurance costs are fixed regardless of household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Therefore, for single retirees, financial planning is even more critical to strategically stretch income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Why Many Seniors Keep Working

Retirement does not always mean a complete cessation of work. In 2022, over 1.9 million Canadians aged 65 and older reported employment income, contributing $58.8 billion in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Reasons for continued employment include:
*   **Financial Necessity**: Some retirees lack sufficient savings to cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Inflation Pressure**: Rising costs make it difficult to rely solely on pensions and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Personal Fulfillment**: Many retirees enjoy staying active through part-time jobs, consulting, or small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While working can supplement income, it's not the only strategy. Smart planning can create a sustainable financial future without extending employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Real-Life Financial Planning Scenario

A condensed financial planning scenario demonstrates how crucial strategic planning is to manage retirement income, especially in the face of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]].

### Client Profile: John Doe
*   **Age**: 65, planning to retire soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Income in Retirement**: Approx. $30,000 (around Canadian average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Desired Spending**: $65,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Assets**:
    *   RRSP: $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
    *   TFSA: $75,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
    *   Non-registered account: $50,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   **Concerns/Goals**: Not running out of money, leaving an inheritance for his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Current Investments**:
    *   RRSP/TFSA: 60% equity, 40% fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
    *   Non-registered: 20% equity, 80% cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

### Initial Assessment (Conservative Estimates)
*   **Return Rates**: 5.4% for equity, 3.4% for fixed income, 2.4% for cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **[[role_of_investment_returns_and_inflation_in_cpp_planning | Inflation]]**: 2.1% increase in spending annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

#### Projected Outcome
The initial assessment revealed significant concerns:
*   A $65,000 spending target would increase to $88,000 by age 80 due to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   John would likely run out of money around age 78, with nothing left by age 79, except for his principal residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   To sustain his lifestyle until age 95, he would need to borrow $1.58 million, exceeding his home's value and resulting in a negative estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   Both goals—not running out of money and leaving an inheritance—would not be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Recommendations for a Sustainable Plan
To address these challenges, the financial planner proposed several adjustments:
*   **[[home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_retirement | Downgrade Home]]**: Move from an $800,000 house to a $600,000 house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Delay Retirement**: Continue working until age 70, allowing for delayed Old Age Security (OAS) and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits until age 70, which typically results in higher payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Increase Savings**: Save an additional $1,000 annually into TFSA and $2,000 into RRSP over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Investments**: Increase asset allocation towards equity due to a longer investment horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **Decrease Spending**: Reduce annual spending to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

These changes would allow John to sustain his income until age 95, incur manageable debt lower than his house value, and achieve his goal of leaving assets to his daughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Conclusion
This scenario highlights how a well-structured financial plan reduces uncertainty and provides options for retirees to feel secure about their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. It's crucial to identify unrealistic goals early, as finding out at age 75 that you're running out of money is far too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. For individuals relying solely on average income without significant assets or [[home_ownership_and_its_impact_on_retirement | home ownership]], financial planning becomes even more vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The earlier one starts, the more control they will have over their financial future, building security over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Retirement is too important to leave to chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

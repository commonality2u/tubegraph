The key to [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | maximizing your savings]] isn't just understanding individual tax credits, but also knowing how to stack them together for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many Canadians are unaware of how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Retirement Tax Saving Combo

For retirement tax savings, a common planning strategy involves combining the pension income amount with the age amount credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### Pension Income Amount
Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Any unused portion can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the age amount tax credit, a non-refundable credit designed to reduce taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For [[updates_on_tax_credits_for_2025 | 2025]], the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, potentially reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This credit is gradually reduced if net income exceeds around $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Example: John and Linda
Consider John and Linda, both retired. John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income. Since they are both over 65, they can each claim the pension income amount to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. John also qualifies for the age amount credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

> [00:09:11] The stack savings are: Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund.

As a bonus tip, pension income splitting could save them even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## Family Tax Saving Combo

Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This falls under [[family_tax_planning | family tax planning]].

### Canada Child Benefit (CCB)
The CCB provides tax-free monthly payments to help families with the cost of raising children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. In [[updates_on_tax_credits_for_2025 | 2025]], parents can receive up to $7,997 per child under six and $6,743 per child aged 6 to 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The benefit is income-tested and payments fade out as family income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Child Care Expenses Deduction
This deduction allows you to claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)
The CCA provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For [[updates_on_tax_credits_for_2025 | 2025]], eligible individuals can claim up to $8,610 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Example: Sarah and Mike
Sarah and Mike have two young children. Their children are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefit:** They receive tax-free monthly payments for child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount:** Since one child has a disability, they receive an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

> [00:10:20] The stack savings are: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings.

A bonus tip for families is to split income by contributing to a spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## Other Combinations

*   **Medical Expenses Tax Credit and Home Accessibility Expenses:** The home accessibility credit, allowing seniors and persons with disabilities to claim up to $20,000 in home renovation expenses to improve accessibility, can be combined with the [[maximizing_medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | medical expenses tax credit]] for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

These are just some examples of how to combine tax credits to put more money back in your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Optimizing your taxes and combining credits can lead to significant [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

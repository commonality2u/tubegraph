Delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits beyond age 60 can be a strategic financial decision for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While starting [[cpp_benefits_at_ages_60_65_and_70 | CPP at age 60]] might seem appealing, there are several significant advantages to [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying your CPP]] payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## 1. Significantly Increased Monthly Payments

The most apparent benefit of [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying your CPP]] is receiving a substantially higher monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Starting at Age 65**: This serves as the baseline, for example, $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Starting at Age 60**: Your benefits are reduced by 0.6% per month, totaling a 36% reduction compared to age 65, resulting in approximately $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   **Delaying to Age 70**: Your benefits increase by 0.7% per month, totaling a 42% increase over age 65, leading to about $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:15]</a>.
Delaying CPP to age 70 can more than double your monthly benefit compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:32]</a>.

## 2. Sufficient Income and Savings to Bridge the Gap

If you have ample income or savings from sources like RRSPs, TFSAs, or workplace pensions, you can comfortably cover your expenses from age 60 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:02:01]</a>. This allows your investments to continue growing while you avoid reducing your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:10]</a>. Starting increased CPP payments at age 70 can then provide a significant boost to your retirement income, enhancing long-term financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:22]</a>.

## 3. Good Health and Increased Life Expectancy

Being in good [[impact_of_health_and_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | health]] is a strong indicator to delay CPP past 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:50]</a>. Current [[life_expectancy_and_its_impact_on_cpp_timing | life expectancy]] for a 60-year-old in Canada is around 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:03:02]</a>. Delaying CPP helps hedge against the risk of outliving other retirement savings because CPP payments last for your entire life once started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:21]</a>. The breakeven point where delaying from age 65 to 70 becomes more financially advantageous is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:39]</a>.

## 4. Protection Against Inflation

CPP benefits are indexed to inflation, meaning your payouts will increase to keep pace with the rising cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:17]</a>. For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:24]</a>. The longer you delay, the larger your inflation-indexed CPP payments will be, offering a unique and valuable form of guaranteed, inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:42]</a>.

## 5. Trust in CPP Management and Sustainability

Concerns about the CPP running out of money are largely unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Growing Contributions**: CPP contributions are projected to significantly grow, with base CPP contributions increasing from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Regular Reviews**: The CPP undergoes independent peer reviews, with the latest report confirming its financial sustainability for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Solid Investment Returns**: The CPP Investment Portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as per its 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:41]</a>.
These factors indicate that the CPP is well-funded and at a very low risk of being underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:27]</a>.

## 6. Managing OAS Clawbacks (Old Age Security)

If you are not concerned about the [[the_benefits_and_drawbacks_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | OAS]] clawback threshold, delaying CPP can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:07:00]</a>. The OAS clawback starts if your income exceeds $90,995 (as of the latest figures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:31]</a>. If your total retirement income, even with higher delayed CPP payments, remains below this threshold, you can enjoy larger CPP benefits without losing any OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:26]</a>.

## 7. Ineligibility for GIS (Guaranteed Income Supplement)

If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from sources like RRSPs or work pensions, making you ineligible for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), then delaying CPP is a sound choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:49]</a>. Since you won't qualify for GIS anyway, having larger CPP payments from delaying will increase your overall income without penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:09:09]</a>.

## 8. RRSP Tax Planning

Delaying CPP can align with strategies to draw down your RRSP quicker during ages 60 to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:36]</a>. This can help minimize RRSP taxes upon death, leaving more money for your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:28]</a>. By using RRSP withdrawals to cover expenses in your early 60s, you reduce your RRSP balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:10:01]</a>. Then, at age 70, your enhanced CPP benefits kick in, reducing the need for further large RRSP withdrawals and potentially leading to less taxes upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:39]</a>.

## 9. Still Working in Your 60s

If you plan to continue working into your 60s or even 70s, delaying CPP makes sense for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:51]</a>:
*   **Reduced Immediate Need**: You likely won't need the CPP income early if you're still earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Continued Contributions**: Even if you start CPP early at 60, you'll still need to make contributions from age 60 to 65 if you continue working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Superior Return**: The benefit from [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying CPP]] will likely be greater than attempting to achieve similar returns by taking CPP early and investing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:33]</a>.

## 10. More Predictable and Stable Income

By [[delaying_cpp_benefits | delaying your CPP]] and using other investments like RRSPs or TFSAs to cover expenses from 60 to 70, you are essentially trading uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:12:30]</a>. This strategy provides more predictable and stable income in your later retirement years, as you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:45]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | decision on when to take CBP]] depends on your unique personal financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:19]</a>. For personalized guidance on how to [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | optimize your CPP]] and other retirement benefits, consider seeking expert advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:27]</a>.

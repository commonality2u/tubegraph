The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) serves as a vital instrument for the Canadian government, aiming to alleviate child poverty and provide crucial support to families throughout the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Reducing Child Poverty
Since its introduction, the CCB has had a substantial impact on child poverty rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. In 2021 alone, the benefit contributed to lifting 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The program also supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Addressing Declining Birth Rates
Beyond its role in poverty reduction, the CCB also attempts to address the issue of declining birth rates in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. By easing the financial burden associated with raising children, the benefit aims to encourage families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

A common misconception among employees is that a salary increase might lead to taking home less money due to entering a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This idea suggests that crossing a certain income threshold could result in a net loss, but this is a classic myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Common Misconception

Consider a scenario where an employee currently earns $56,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, placing them in a federal tax bracket of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If offered a raise to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, they might decline, fearing that crossing the $57,375 income threshold would bump them into a 20.5% tax bracket, leading them to believe they would take home less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This represents a significant [[misconceptions_about_tax_rates | misconception about tax rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## How a Progressive Tax System Works

Canada operates under a [[progressive_tax_system | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, which means different portions of your income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. When you enter a higher [[tax_brackets_in_canada | tax bracket in Canada]], the new, higher rate only applies to the income earned *above* the threshold for that bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

For example, if the threshold for the 20.5% tax bracket is $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   Any income up to $57,375 is still taxed at the lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* $57,375 (e.g., the difference between $60,000 and $57,375) is taxed at the new 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

This means that an [[impact_of_salary_increase_on_taxes | increase in salary]] will always result in a higher net income, as only the marginal amount falls into the new bracket.

## Always Better to Get a Raise

Understanding how [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax brackets]] function in a progressive system clarifies that it is always financially beneficial to receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The belief that a higher salary might lead to less take-home pay is a myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, and accepting a raise will always result in greater [[financial_benefits_of_higher_income_despite_higher_tax_bracket | financial benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Canadians are increasingly delaying [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]], with the average retirement age reaching 65.3 in 2024, the highest in nearly half a century. This represents a four-year increase in less than a generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees leave the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

While some Canadians aged 65 to 74 continue to work by choice (around 12%) to stay active and connected, a significant portion (9%) do so out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Retirement ages vary by sector:
*   **Public sector employees** tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Private sector workers** typically retire around 65.5 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Self-employed Canadians** often work the longest, retiring at an average of nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

There are six primary [[reasons_for_leaving_canada | reasons]] contributing to this trend of Canadians working longer:

## 1. Canadians Are Living Longer
People are living longer than in the past, which significantly impacts [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:48">[02:21:48]</a>. Life expectancy increases with age; for example, if you reach 65 and are healthy, you likely have two more decades or more ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

Life expectancy projections by age:
*   **At 40:** Men can expect to live to 78, women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>.
*   **At 50:** Men are projected to live to 79, women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **At 60:** Men are looking at an 80.5-year life expectancy, women at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   **At 70:** Men reach about an 83.2 life expectancy, women at 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

This means [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] is no longer a 10-year plan but a 20 to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding, health management, and a re-evaluation of purpose outside of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>.

## 2. Pension Coverage Has Changed
For many years, Canadians relied on defined benefit pensions, which offered a predictable income for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>. However, these pensions are becoming less common, particularly in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:47">[03:48:47]</a>.

Today, private sector workers are more likely to have defined contribution plans, where [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement income]] depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:08">[03:57:08]</a>. Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning the majority must rely on personal savings like RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. For most people, [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] has become a "DIY" endeavor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:04">[04:23:04]</a>.

## 3. Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without a matching boost in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:02">[04:30:02]</a>.
*   **Shelter costs** were up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:05">[04:35:05]</a>. Renters are also experiencing significant squeeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:09">[04:49:09]</a>.
*   **Food prices** have increased by over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:04">[04:55:04]</a>.
*   **Healthcare costs** can be a "silent budget killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:07">[05:03:07]</a>. While public healthcare exists, it doesn't cover everything. Out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physiotherapy, and prescriptions increase with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:07">[05:10:07]</a>.

It's increasingly challenging to make ends meet on a fixed income, especially when still renting, carrying debt, or supporting family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:03">[05:18:03]</a>. [[tax_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | Taxes]] also quietly reduce available funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:08">[05:27:08]</a>.

## 4. Work Has Become Less Physical
Historically, physical demands often dictated [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]] age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Many jobs were physically demanding, like construction or manufacturing, making [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] a necessary rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:07">[05:46:07]</a>.

However, more Canadians now work in knowledge-based or service jobs, often at a desk, on calls, or on a computer, potentially from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:07">[05:57:07]</a>. If a job is not physically taxing and an individual remains mentally sharp, there is less incentive to stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. Many find work energizing, providing structure, mental activity, and financial benefits without the physical toll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.

## 5. Changing Views on Retirement
There is a generational mindset shift regarding [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. For boomers and Gen Xers, [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]] is increasingly seen as freedom rather than an escape or a complete halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. This freedom can mean:
*   Part-time consulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>
*   Teaching courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>
*   Taking freelance gigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>
*   Starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>

This shift means [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] is less of a "cliff" (a hard stop) and more of a "ramp" (a slow transition into something more flexible and personally fulfilling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection, which many retirees miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. Instead of entirely quitting, many reshape their work to better fit their desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

## 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" is quietly reshaping [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]] timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. The number of Canadians over 50 getting divorced has been rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. Late-life separations often trigger a major financial reset:
*   Sale of shared assets (e.g., home) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>
*   Division of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>
*   Legal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>
*   Need to support two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>

Even a solid couple's [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement plan]] may be insufficient for two individuals. Starting over often involves new expenses, potentially a new mortgage or rent, and fewer years to rebuild savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Consequently, many experiencing late-life breakups delay [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]], downsize their lifestyle, or re-enter the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## The Role of Uncertainty
Uncertainty acts as a significant deterrent to [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. Despite having sufficient savings on paper, factors like volatile markets, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation (even if improved from previous years) can create hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Added concerns include rising health care costs, geopolitical tensions, and general anxiety about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

Many Canadians delay [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] not out of strict necessity, but for a sense of safety and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. The idea of living on a fixed income feels riskier than it used to be. A single negative event—like a market dip, medical emergency, or rent hike—could derail an entire [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | plan]] that relies solely on CPP, OAS, and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This leads people to work longer, delay tapping into savings, and build a larger financial buffer for comfort, not just necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

## The Trade-Off: Time
While delaying [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] for security is common, there's a significant trade-off: time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Time is a valuable asset in [[retirement_planning_for_canadian_expats | retirement]], and its value increases as one has less of it. Proponents of earlier [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement]] argue it allows individuals to buy back time and enjoy more healthy years of life, rather than merely striving for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.

## Retirement Scenario Example
A hypothetical retiree, Keanu, is 65, single, aims for a $50,000 annual spending, made $90,000 annually, has $400,000 in RRSP and $100,000 in TFSA, and owns a paid-off home with no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. CPP and OAS are assumed at standard eligibility from 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1: Retire at 65, immediate CPP/OAS, live off savings.**
    *   Keanu would run out of money by age 83, with RRSP depletion and TFSA not covering needs. This assumes no major health or inflation surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
    *   Lesson: $500,000 in savings may not be enough for 25+ years without a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

*   **Scenario 2: Work three more years (to 68), save, immediate CPP/OAS at 65.**
    *   Money easily lasts through age 90, with a net estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
    *   Lesson: Just three extra years of work can provide over a decade of financial breathing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

*   **Scenario 3: Work two more years (to 67), delay CPP/OAS to 70.**
    *   Still results in a shortfall due to aggressive RRSP withdrawals between ages 67-69 to cover the gap, draining funds too quickly for later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
    *   Lesson: Delaying CPP is powerful, but without a smart withdrawal strategy, it can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

*   **Scenario 4: Work two more years (to 67), delay CPP/OAS to 70, strategic RRSP withdrawals.**
    *   Keanu draws gradually from his RRSP between ages 67-69, just enough to cover needs while keeping [[tax_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | taxes]] low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
    *   Outcome: Steady income, lower lifetime [[tax_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | tax bill]], and a sizable estate over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
    *   Lesson: A combination of working a bit longer, delaying CPP, and strategically managing RRSP withdrawals provides balance and a working plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

This example illustrates that even small adjustments in [[financial_planning_for_canadian_retirees | retirement planning]], such as timing payments and withdrawals, can make a substantial difference, allowing individuals to build a sustainable [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement plan]] without necessarily needing to double their savings or work until a very advanced age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

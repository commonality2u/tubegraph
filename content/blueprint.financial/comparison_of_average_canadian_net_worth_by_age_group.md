Understanding how your [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] compares to the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age | average Canadian]], especially within your age group, can provide valuable insights into your financial standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article deep dives into [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] data, breaking it down by various factors including age, household type, and income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Overall Canadian Net Worth Trends

[[net_worth_growth_trends_in_canada | Canadian household net worth]] has shown consistent growth from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. It increased from approximately $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This growth was largely due to gains in real estate and financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although there was a slight dip to about $979,000 in 2023, likely influenced by inflation and post-pandemic spending, it rebounded to over $1 million by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Real Estate's Impact on Net Worth

Real estate is a significant component of Canadian wealth, accounting for over 50% of [[household_net_worth_in_canada | household net worth]] during this period, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This reliance on property has been a key driver of [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, heavy dependence on a single asset class like real estate carries risks, as a downturn in the housing market could significantly reduce [[household_net_worth_in_canada | household net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Homeowners Versus Renters: A Growing Wealth Gap

A notable wealth gap exists between homeowners and renters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. In 2024, homeowners had an average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of $1.38 million, which is nearly five times higher than renters, who averaged $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Both groups saw growth in [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] from 2020 to 2024, with homeowners experiencing a 33% increase and renters a 31% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The primary factor behind this difference is real estate appreciation, which disproportionately benefits homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Renters, with less exposure to real estate, largely depend on financial assets for wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Average Net Worth by Age Group (2020-2024)

[[household_net_worth_in_canada | Net worth]] typically evolves across different life stages, reflecting individual financial journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Less Than 35 Years

In this early career stage, [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] tends to be lower due to asset building and debt management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Canadians under 35 saw their [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] increase from $231,000 in 2020 to $338,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Financial volatility is common in this group, often due to student loans and early career challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### 35 to 44 Years

As individuals enter their 30s and 40s, [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] generally grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. By 2024, the average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] for this group reached $658,000, up from $490,000 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This is a crucial phase for investing in real estate and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 45 to 54 Years and 55 to 64 Years

[[household_net_worth_in_canada | Net worth]] typically peaks within these two age brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In 2024:
*   Those aged 45 to 54 had an average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of $1.35 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Those aged 55 to 64 reached $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
This accumulation is heavily influenced by real estate and retirement account growth, marking the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### 65 Years and Older (De-accumulation Phase)

In retirement, [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] tends to plateau or grow modestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For those over 65, [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] rose from $863,000 in 2020 to $1.12 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, it often decreases from the peak seen in previous age groups as individuals begin drawing down assets for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Net Worth by Household Type

Comparing one-person and multi-person households reveals a clear wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By 2024, multi-person households had nearly double the [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of one-person households, with $1.17 million versus $634,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This difference is mainly due to multi-person households having larger total assets ($1.4 million vs. $740,000), often benefiting from two income providers and shared expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

However, one-person households are closing the gap in terms of growth; from 2020 to 2024, their [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] increased by 40%, compared to 29.4% for multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Real estate remains a major factor for both groups, making up 55% of [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] for multi-person households and 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This suggests multi-person households may have a greater ability to afford property, while single individuals might be increasingly priced out of the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## The Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

According to a 2021 PBO report, the threshold for being in the top 1% of [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This group comprises approximately 160,000 families and holds nearly 24.8% of the total [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net wealth]] in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Median Versus Average Net Worth

When evaluating [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | net worth]] figures, it's important to distinguish between median and average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The median is often a more representative measure as it represents the middle point, with half of households having more and half having less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The average, conversely, can be skewed by the ultra-wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For instance, in 2019, the median [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] for multi-person households was $514,000, while the average in 2020 was $907,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This significant distortion is due to extremely wealthy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Although Statistics Canada stopped reporting median [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] after 2019, it's estimated that the typical household's [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] is likely around 50% lower than the average today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Using the median as a benchmark provides a more realistic financial picture for most Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Net Worth by Income Level

[[household_net_worth_in_canada | Net worth]] data by income level confirms that higher earnings generally correlate with higher [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. In 2024, the top 20% of income earners had a [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of over $2.29 million, more than six times that of the bottom 20%, who were at $375,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The top group gained almost $460,000 in just four years, further widening the wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

However, middle-income households (41% to 80% income group) experienced the fastest percentage growth in [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This indicates that consistent investing and benefiting from rising real estate and financial markets can lead to substantial wealth growth even outside the top income brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Lower-income households made modest gains but continue to face challenges in accessing high-growth opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Comparing Net Worth Internationally

When comparing [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] internationally (using UBS Global Wealth Data Book figures in US dollars), Canada's average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] ranks between the UK and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Switzerland stands out with an average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of $685,000 USD, 85% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The US average is also 49% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Conversely, countries like Germany and China had significantly lower averages; Germany's average is 31% lower than Canada's, and China's is almost 80% lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Australia's median [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] is 80% higher than Canadians', and its average is 34% higher, potentially bolstered by a large housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## How to Use Net Worth Data to Increase Your Own Net Worth

Net worth data is a strategic tool for setting realistic financial goals and building wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

1.  **Set Realistic Goals:** Use [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] data for your age group as a benchmark to set achievable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Prioritize Investing:** Wealthy households grow their [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] through investing, not just earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Evaluate your assets and ensure you are investing adequately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Optimize Financial Assets:** Focus on optimizing investment vehicles like TFSAs ([[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA balances by age range in Canada]]), RSPs, and other investment accounts, as these are key for long-term wealth accumulation, especially for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
4.  **Leverage Real Estate:** Given its significant role in Canadian wealth (over 50% of the average Canadian's wealth), if home ownership is a goal, work towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Otherwise, consider how to leverage property you already own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
5.  **Benchmark and Track Progress:** Utilize strategies from top earners, such as minimizing debt and diversifying investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Regularly track your progress and adjust your financial strategy as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

While comparison can be motivating, remember that "comparison is the thief of joy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Focus on your unique financial journey and celebrate your own progress rather than constantly comparing yourself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Building your [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] is about having the proper strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

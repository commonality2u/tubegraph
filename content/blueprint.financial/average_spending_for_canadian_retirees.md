Understanding spending patterns is a common concern for individuals planning for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article breaks down the average expenditures for Canadian retirees, detailing what they spend their money on and how spending evolves through different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overall Average Expenditure

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is approximately $61,800 annually, or $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## [[breakdown_of_retiree_expenses_in_canada | Breakdown of Retiree Expenses]] by Category

For retirees in Canada, expenditures are primarily allocated to several key categories:

*   **Shelter**
    *   The largest portion of retiree spending is on shelter, which encompasses the cost of their main accommodation and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   On average, retirees spend about $13,814 annually on shelter, equating to $1,151 per month, which represents 22.3% of their total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   Despite many retirees owning their homes, significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities continue to be incurred, highlighting the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses even after mortgage payments cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**
    *   Retirees spend approximately $7,667 annually on food, averaging $639 per month, or 12.4% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Transportation**
    *   While generally lower for retirees compared to younger individuals, transportation still accounts for 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**
    *   Even with free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation for retirees due to increased medical needs as people age, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**
    *   This category takes up 5.4% of monthly spending, underscoring the need for continued financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**
    *   Expenses for maintaining the home, classified as household operations, amount to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## How Spending Changes with Age

Data from Stat Canada provides a clear picture of how household spending evolves with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years)**
    *   This period sees the highest spending, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   This peak is driven by higher family needs, including larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, with a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years)**
    *   Spending decreases slightly to an average of $99,250 annually or $8,233 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
    *   During this period, childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There is also an increased focus on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years)**
    *   Spending drops further to $61,800 annually, or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease due to reduced work-related travel, and there's less spending on luxuries, with more emphasis on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending typically occurs in three phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Summary of Life Stage Spending

*   **Pre-Retirement (55-64)**: Spending begins to decrease as childcare costs drop, with a shift in focus to healthcare and paying off mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

*   **Retirement Phases**: Within retirement, there are distinct high, medium, and low spending phases, as activity levels typically decrease, leading to less overall expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Real-Life Spending Patterns Among Clients

Financial advisors observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   On average, retirees tend to spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   High-spending households often have minimum expenditures of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Spending can vary significantly; some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   This reduction is attributed to factors like lower housing costs, less need for transportation, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends is crucial for planning a sustainable [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement budget]] and anticipating changes in spending habits to ensure sufficient savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

This article breaks down the average spending for Canadian retirees, what they spend their money on, and how [[breakdown_of_expenditure_categories_for_retirees | spending changes]] through different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overall Average Expenditure

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees aged 65 and over is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, which translates to approximately $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[breakdown_of_expenditure_categories_for_retirees | Breakdown of Expenditure Categories for Canadian Retirees]]

For retirees in Canada, the largest portions of their budget are allocated to specific categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>:

*   **Shelter**
    *   Represents the largest portion of spending, including main accommodation costs and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Average annual spend: $13,814 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

    *   Percentage of monthly spending: 22.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
    *   Even if a mortgage is paid off, retirees still incur significant costs for maintenance, property taxes, and utilities, underscoring the importance of budgeting for ongoing home-related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**
    *   Average annual spend: $7,667 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**
    *   Percentage of monthly spending: 5.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, highlighting the need for continued [[retirement_income_and_financial_security_in_canada | financial security]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

    *   Percentage of monthly spending: 5.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## How Costs Decrease Throughout Life

Household spending patterns evolve significantly across different life stages, from middle age through retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Data from Stat Canada shows a clear picture of this evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>:

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years)**
    *   Average annual spending: $102,646 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   Average monthly spending: $8,554 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   Spending is at its highest peak, driven by larger family needs, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, with a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years)**
    *   Average annual spending: $99,250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Average monthly spending: $8,271 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   Spending slightly decreases as child care expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There is also a greater focus on paying off mortgages and preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years)**
    *   Average annual spending: $61,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   Average monthly spending: $5,150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   Spending drops further, with a shift in focus to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Transportation costs decrease due to reduced work-related travel, and there's less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

Retirement spending generally occurs in three phases: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Early Retirement (65-70 years)

In the early years of retirement (ages 65-70), spending tends to be higher. For example, a retiree might spend about $70,000 annually or approximately $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

*   **Housing Costs**: High, but reduced now that the mortgage is paid off, though maintenance and property taxes remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Transportation Costs**: Significantly decreased due to no more daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel still occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs**: Start to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Food Costs**: Slightly less, as retirees dine out less and prepare more meals at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Spending**: Enjoyment of hobbies and travel, taking advantage of newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Mid-Retirement (70-75 years)

As retirees move into their mid-retirement years (ages 70-75), annual spending typically decreases. An example retiree might spend around $60,000 annually or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

*   **Housing Costs**: Stabilize and may slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Transportation Costs**: Reduce further as travel lessens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Expenses**: Continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Food Costs**: Remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Spending**: Spending on travel reduces slightly, with a greater focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Later Retirement (75+ years)

In later retirement (after age 75), annual spending typically drops further. An example retiree's annual spending might drop to $50,000 per year or around $4,167 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

*   **Housing Costs**: Remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Transportation Costs**: Significantly lower as travel becomes rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Becomes a major expense, including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Food Expenses**: Relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Spending**: Travel spending grounds to a halt, with a focus on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Generally, as retirees become less active, they tend to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## [[the_reality_of_retiree_income_in_canada | Real-Life Spending Patterns Among Canadian Retirees]]

Observations from financial planners indicate a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

*   **Average Range**: Retirees tend to spend anywhere from $4,000 to $7,000 or $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **High-End Households**: Can spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Significant Variation**: Some retirees manage comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending typically starts at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. There is typically about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This reduction is attributed to factors such as lowering housing costs, decreased transportation needs, and overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. As retirees age, their spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities often declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Understanding these trends can help in planning a sustainable retirement budget by anticipating changes in spending habits, ensuring enough savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

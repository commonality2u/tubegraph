Understanding monthly spending is a common concern for individuals [[financial_planning_for_retirement_in_canada | planning their retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down the average spending for Canadian retirees, what they spend their money on, and how [[changes_in_spending_habits_as_retirees_age | spending changes]] through the different stages of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overall Average Expenditure

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees, defined as those aged 65 and over, is $61,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This breaks down to approximately $5,154 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Breakdown of Spending Categories

For retirees in Canada, expenditures are distributed across several key categories:

*   **Shelter**: The largest portion of spending goes to shelter, which includes main accommodation costs and related expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. On average, retirees spend around $3,814 annually on shelter, equating to $1,151 per month, or 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[budgeting_for_retirement_in_canada | budgeting]] for ongoing home-related expenses like maintenance, property taxes, and utilities, even after mortgage payments have ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Food**: Food is another significant category, with retirees spending about $767 annually, or $639 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This accounts for 12.4% of their monthly spending and includes both groceries and dining out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: While generally lower than for younger people, transportation still represents 8.8% of a retiree's monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Despite free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation in retirement due to increased medical needs as people age, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**: This category takes up a significant portion at 5.4% of monthly spending, underscoring the need for continued [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | financial security]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**: Expenses for maintaining the home add up to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## How Costs Decrease Throughout Life

Household spending patterns evolve significantly with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:

*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years)**: Spending is at its highest peak, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This rise is driven by family needs such as larger homes, increased food consumption, and education costs for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise, with a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years)**: Spending decreases slightly to about $99,250 annually on average, or $8,270 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. During this period, childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. There is also a greater focus on paying off mortgages and further preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years)**: Spending drops further to $61,800 annually, or $5,154 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs like housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there is less spending on luxuries and more on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Phases of Spending in Retirement

The average costs only tell part of the story. Generally, there are three distinct phases of spending in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>:

1.  **High Spending Phase**
2.  **Medium Spending Phase**
3.  **Low Spending Phase**

Here's an example illustrating these phases:

> Consider Alex, a Canadian retiree, as he transitions through these stages:
>
> *   **Early Retirement (65-70 years)**: Alex spends about $70,000 annually or $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Housing costs remain high despite the mortgage being paid off, due to maintenance and property taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Transportation costs decrease significantly with no daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel are still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Healthcare costs begin to rise, and food spending is slightly less due to dining out less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Alex enjoys spending on hobbies and travel, leveraging his newfound free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
> *   **Mid-Retirement (70-75 years)**: Alex's annual spending decreases to around $60,000 or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Housing costs stabilize or slightly decrease, possibly due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Transportation costs reduce further, and healthcare expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Food costs remain stable or decrease further, and spending on travel reduces as he focuses more on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
> *   **Later Retirement (After 75 years)**: Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year or around $4,166 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Housing costs remain stable with ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Transportation costs are significantly lower, and healthcare becomes a major expense, potentially including long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Food expenses are relatively low, and travel spending grinds to a halt as Alex focuses more on community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Real-Life Observations

Financial planners often observe a wide range of retirement spending patterns among clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. On average, retirees tend to spend anywhere from $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-end households might spend $5,000 to $9,000 per month or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, this can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and gradually decreases, similar to Alex's example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For instance, $100,000 annually in initial retirement years might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This reduction can be attributed to several factors:
*   Lowering housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Reduced need for transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Overall [[changes_in_spending_habits_as_retirees_age | lifestyle changes]] as retirees age, such as declining spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Understanding these trends is crucial for planning a sustainable [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement budget]] and ensuring enough savings to cover all needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

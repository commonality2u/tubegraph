For Canadians, the feeling of being pressured to [[current_tipping_practices_in_canada | tip]] more has become a common sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The [[public_opinion_on_tipping_culture | public opinion on tipping culture]] in Canada varies, with some finding it awkward, especially those from countries where it's not customary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Origins of Tipping in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

The practice of tipping in Canada began in the early 1900s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It was introduced as a tradition from Europe, specifically stemming from a master-servant custom in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Evolution: From Gesture to Expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

By the 1950s, tipping evolved from being a polite gesture to an expectation in various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If one dined out, stayed at a hotel, or took a taxi, tipping became a practical requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

By the late 20th century, tipping percentages significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. What began as a modest token of appreciation transformed into a calculated equation, with common percentages like 15%, 18%, and 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This shift made tipping feel less like a reward for good service and more like an essential part of daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Tipflation: The Rising Cost of Gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

[[current_tipping_practices_in_canada | Tipping habits in Canada]] have changed significantly, with expectations rising across various services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
Canadians are now tipping more frequently, with high percentages tipping:
*   Hairdressers: 76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   Bartenders: 74% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Food delivery drivers: 71% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

However, tipping remains less common for hotel housekeepers (34%) and coffee shop workers (29%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The average tip amount has increased from 16% to 20% between 2019 and 2023, reflecting a growing pressure to tip more across a wider range of services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

Tipping has become a social expectation, particularly in restaurants and bars, where the norm has risen to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Services that historically saw little to no tipping, such as coffee shops and fast food, are now experiencing a rise in tipping due to the convenience of digital payment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This highlights that tipping practices remain selective based on the specific service provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Public Sentiment on Tipping's Evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

There is a growing frustration with [[public_opinion_on_tipping_culture | tipping culture in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   64% of Canadians report being asked to tip more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   62% feel pressured to leave higher tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   In 2016, 43% of Canadians tipped under 15%, but now only 23% do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   The number of people tipping 20% or more has more than doubled from 8% in 2016 to 21% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

"Tip creep" is also causing fatigue, with 83% of Canadians feeling that too many places now ask for tips, yet only 13% believe service has improved as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. A majority of Canadians (59%) now prefer a service-included model with higher wages for staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Regionally, British Columbia reports the highest levels of tip creep (74%) and tipflation (73%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Many Canadians (73%) believe the current tipping system allows employers to underpay their employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Tipping, once a genuine thank you for great service, now feels like an automatic part of the bill, expected regardless of service quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This dynamic has led to situations where workers rely on tips to make ends meet, which can create a "weird dynamic" where service can feel transactional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

> "Tipping used to be a genuine thank you for great service but now it feels like just another part of the bill expected whether the service was good or not it's almost as routine now as paying GST on a bill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

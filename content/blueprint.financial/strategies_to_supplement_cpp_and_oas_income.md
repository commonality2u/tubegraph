Many Canadians believe that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, for most, relying solely on these benefits is not an easy path and often results in a barebones lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. CPP is designed to replace only around 25% to 33% of working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

While it is technically possible to survive on CPP and OAS, it typically requires significant sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This article explores various strategies to supplement these government benefits, ensuring a more comfortable retirement.

## Why Supplement CPP and OAS?

A total estimated income combining CPP, OAS, and potentially the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) for very low-income seniors, might be around $2,000 per month if you have no other income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This amount is barely above the poverty line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Major expenses, such as housing, food, healthcare, utilities, and transportation, can quickly consume this income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. For example:
*   **Housing**: If renting, even in smaller cities, a minimum of $1,000 per month is common, potentially wiping out over half your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. In major cities like Toronto or Vancouver, rents for a one-bedroom can easily exceed $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Homeowners still face property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, potentially $500 or more monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Food**: A basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Owning a car can add $200-$500 per month for insurance, gas, and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Public transit costs at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

This limited income leaves little room for travel, big purchases, or emergencies, often leading to reliance on family or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Traditional Strategies to Supplement Income

If CPP and OAS alone won't cover your expenses, several conventional approaches can help bridge the gap:

### 1. Delaying CPP and OAS
[[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Delaying your CPP and OAS benefits]] can significantly increase your monthly payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **CPP**: Delaying until age 70 can boost your benefits by 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For example, the average monthly payment increases from $517 at age 60 to $1,147 at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   **OAS**: Delaying OAS can increase payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   Note: At age 75, there is an automatic 10% increase in the OAS pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, making the maximum monthly payment $800 as of March 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### 2. Part-Time Work or Delayed Retirement
Continuing to work part-time or delaying your full retirement can significantly boost your income and make your savings last longer throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### 3. Lowering Housing Costs
Housing is often the largest expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Strategies include:
*   **Owning a Home Outright**: If you own your home mortgage-free, your housing costs are substantially lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. You could also borrow against your home or downsize to release capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Relocating**: Moving to a very low-cost area within Canada, such as small towns or rural parts, can offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### 4. Taking Advantage of Government Benefits
Beyond CPP and OAS, other programs can provide additional financial support:
*   **Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**: Designed for very low-income seniors, GIS can provide up to $900 per month for single seniors with no other income as of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, other income sources, like RRSP withdrawals, can reduce GIS eligibility dollar for dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Allowance for the Survivor**: This program provides additional financial support to eligible individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### 5. Smart Financial Planning
*   **Tax Planning**: Strategies like income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower your tax burden and increase your after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Professional Guidance**: Financial planning services, like Blueprint Financial, can help create a customized [[retirement_strategies_integrating_cpp | retirement strategy]] to maximize government benefits, lower taxes, and build an investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Creative Approaches to Supplement Income

Some retirees are thinking outside the box to make their limited income work:

### 1. House Hacking
Rent out part of your home, offer short-term Airbnb stays, or even become a house sitter to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### 2. Turning Hobbies into Income
Many retirees find ways to monetize their skills and passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Examples include:
*   Teaching music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Selling crafts online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
*   Tutoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   Becoming part-time tour guides in their community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

### 3. Work-for-Stay Arrangements
Programs like TrustedHousesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### 4. Nomadic Retirement
A growing trend involves slow traveling through low-cost countries, taking advantage of extended tourist visas, and living for months at a time where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal offer a higher quality of life for the same income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. For example, a retiree in Mexico lived on around $1,500 a month, including $600 for rent and eating out daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

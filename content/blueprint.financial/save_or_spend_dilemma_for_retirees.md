After decades of [[comparing_saving_versus_investing | saving]], [[comparing_saving_versus_investing | investing]], and planning for retirement, many individuals arrive at this stage with the necessary resources but hesitate to spend what they've accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This common challenge is known as the "save or spend dilemma" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Retirees face the question of how much to spend versus how much to keep in savings each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

The [[mindset_shift_from_saving_to_spending_in_retirement | mindset shift from saving to spending in retirement]] can be uncomfortable, moving from a scarcity mindset to one of abundance where they feel confident using their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This dilemma is frequently observed among retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be a Bad Thing

Hesitation to spend can lead to several negative outcomes for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:

*   **Missed Experiences and Opportunities**
    Retirees may forgo meaningful experiences like travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enhance their "golden years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are the moments that contribute to a fulfilling retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Healthspan Versus Lifespan**
    Dr. Peter Attia, in his book *Outlive*, distinguishes between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting enjoyment of what was saved for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Inflation's Impact**
    Inflation consistently erodes the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While this is a concern, a properly structured [[financial_planning_for_retirees | retirement plan]] should account for inflation to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be a Good Thing

While there are downsides, not spending all accumulated wealth can also be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>:

*   **Encourages Cautious Spending**
    A hesitation to spend promotes thoughtful, deliberate spending habits, discouraging impulse purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Every financial decision is well-considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Helps Money Last Longer**
    This careful approach extends the longevity of funds, reducing the risk of running out of money prematurely, which is a common concern for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This is also known as reducing longevity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk**
    Market losses early in retirement can deplete a portfolio more rapidly than later losses, even if markets recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Spending cautiously helps protect against this "sequence of returns risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Aligns with Legacy Goals**
    For many, a significant priority is leaving a substantial inheritance for loved ones or charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Cautious spending allows retirees to achieve these legacy goals while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Therefore, while under-spending can have negative implications, it can also serve as a protective measure, enhancing financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The key to the save or spend dilemma is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. A major challenge for retirees is knowing how much they can safely spend, given the many variables and factors to consider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It is natural to err on the side of caution to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, this cautious approach might prevent them from enjoying the wealth they worked hard to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It is often possible to achieve all financial goals and still spend more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

This is where a well-structured [[financial_planning_for_retirees | financial plan]] becomes essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. By clearly outlining affordable spending limits and stress-testing the investment portfolio, financial planners can help retirees move from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | Case Study of Retirement Spending Patterns]]: Michael and Karen

Michael (66) and Karen (64) faced the save versus spend dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Client Profile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:
    *   Combined income: $180,000/year (from pensions like CPP, OAS, and work pensions, plus investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Annual expenses: $70,000 (covering basic living, travel, and discretionary spending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Savings: $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Goal: Increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving, but they were unsure how much more they could spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>:
    Michael and Karen lived comfortably but conservatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Their income significantly exceeded their expenses, resulting in a surplus of $110,000, yet they were hesitant to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. With their $4 million portfolio and a sustainable withdrawal rate of 3.5%, they could easily withdraw an additional $140,000 annually, which was more than enough for their desired luxury travel, home renovations, and increased charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Their basic expenses were covered by guaranteed income streams, leaving their investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>:
    To provide peace of mind, their portfolio was stress-tested for poor market conditions, simulating a 30% decline in value in the early years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Even under this scenario, their portfolio remained safe for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Longevity projections assumed they lived to age 95, showing their portfolio would last well beyond their predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>:
    Armed with this information, Michael and Karen gained confidence to spend more freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. They booked luxury vacations, started home renovations, and increased charitable contributions, knowing they could enjoy retirement without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip]
> For clients with larger portfolios, it can be harder to convince them to spend more due to ingrained strict savings habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Easing into spending by setting small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies can help gradually shift the mindset and enhance retirement enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### [[case_study_of_retirement_spending_patterns | Case Study of Retirement Spending Patterns]]: Robert and Susan

Robert (70) and Susan (68) sought to [[strategies_for_balancing_spending_and_saving_in_retirement | balance spending and saving in retirement]] with their legacy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

*   **Client Profile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>:
    *   Combined income: $100,000/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   Annual expenses: $75,000/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Savings: $1.2 million in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   Goal: Leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>:
    Robert and Susan were cautious with spending, aiming for a significant inheritance, despite having a healthy income and substantial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. They were unsure if they could afford more travel and leisure while preserving enough for their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Analysis showed their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover their $75,000 expenses and retain flexibility for increased spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Solution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>:
    To [[strategies_for_balancing_spending_and_saving_in_retirement | balance their lifestyle and legacy goals]], a slight increase in spending from $75,000 to $85,000 per year was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This allowed more funds for travel and experiences while maintaining their inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The portfolio was stress-tested for potential market downturns, confirming that even in adverse conditions, they could maintain spending without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>:
    With the new spending plan, Robert and Susan felt confident in enjoying a higher quality of life now, while still leaving a meaningful inheritance for their loved ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach helped them strike the right balance between enjoying retirement and achieving long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Many retirees, like Robert and Susan, struggle to enjoy their money due to a strong focus on legacy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. It's crucial not to let fear prevent enjoyment of retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Consulting a financial planner can provide a custom plan tailored to individual goals, clarifying how much money can be safely spent in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

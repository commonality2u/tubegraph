Retirees often face a dilemma: how much to spend versus how much to keep in savings each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. After decades of saving, shifting to a spending mindset in retirement can feel uncomfortable, requiring a complete psychological shift from scarcity to abundance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This common struggle is observed with many clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough in Retirement Can Be a Bad Thing

Hesitating to spend can lead to several negative outcomes:

### Missed Experiences and Opportunities
Retirees might miss out on meaningful experiences such as travel, hobbies, or healthcare improvements that could enhance their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These moments are crucial for a fulfilling retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Healthspan Versus Lifespan
Dr. Peter Attia's book *Outlive* highlights the distinction between lifespan (total years lived) and healthspan (years lived in good health, active, independent, and free from chronic disease or disability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting enjoyment of saved wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### [[inflation_concerns_and_retirement_spending | Inflation's Impact]]
Inflation can erode the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. However, this is primarily a concern if a retirement plan is not properly structured to account for inflation and maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough in Retirement Can Be a Good Thing

While under-spending has drawbacks, it also offers benefits:

### Encourages Cautious Spending
Hesitation to spend promotes thoughtful and deliberate financial decisions, preventing impulse purchases and overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This ensures each decision is well-considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Helps Your Money Last
A careful approach helps money stretch further, reducing the risk of running out prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This is known as reducing longevity risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Reduces Portfolio Risk
Cautious spending helps protect against "sequence of returns risk," where market losses early in retirement can deplete a portfolio faster, even if markets later recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Aligns with [[legacy_goals_vs_enjoying_retirement_savings | Legacy Goals]]
For many, a priority is leaving a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Being cautious with spending allows retirees to achieve these [[legacy_goals_vs_enjoying_retirement_savings | legacy goals]] while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The key to the save or spend dilemma is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. A common problem is that retirees don't know how much they can safely spend due to the many variables involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This uncertainty often leads to erring on the side of caution, which, while sensible, can prevent enjoying hard-earned wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. It's often possible to achieve all financial goals and still spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

A well-structured financial plan is essential. By outlining affordable spending levels and stress-testing the investment portfolio, retirees can move from a mindset of fear to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Case Studies in Balancing Retirement Spending

### Michael and Karen: Spending More Freely
*   **Client Profile**: Michael (66) and Karen (64) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
    *   **Combined Income**: $180,000/year (from pensions, CPP, OAS, work pensions, and investments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   **Expenses**: $70,000/year (basic living, travel, discretionary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   **Savings**: $4 million in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **Goal**: Increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Process**: Despite a significant surplus ($110,000 from income exceeding expenses), they were hesitant to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Analysis showed a sustainable withdrawal rate of 3.5% from their $4 million portfolio, allowing an additional $140,000 annually, ample for their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams covered basic expenses, leaving investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution**: Stress-testing their portfolio for poor market conditions (e.g., 30% decline early in retirement) showed their portfolio remained safe for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Longevity projections to age 95 indicated their portfolio would last beyond predicted lifetimes even with higher spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Armed with this information, Michael and Karen confidently booked luxury vacations, began home renovations, and increased charitable contributions, enjoying retirement without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

> ### Pro Tip
> Clients with larger portfolios often find it harder to spend more, due to strict savings habits developed while accumulating wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. To ease into spending, start with small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies to gradually shift mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Robert and Susan: Balancing Spending and [[legacy_goals_vs_enjoying_retirement_savings | Legacy Goals]]
*   **Client Profile**: Robert (70) and Susan (68) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
    *   **Combined Income**: $100,000/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   **Expenses**: $75,000/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   **Savings**: $1.2 million in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
    *   **Goal**: Leave a meaningful inheritance for children and grandchildren while still enjoying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Process**: Robert and Susan were cautious, aiming for a significant inheritance despite a healthy income and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combined with their income, they had more than enough to cover expenses and increase discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Solution**: To balance lifestyle and [[legacy_goals_vs_enjoying_retirement_savings | legacy goals]], a slight spending increase from $75,000 to $85,000 per year was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This allowed more for travel and experiences while preserving their inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Stress-testing confirmed their financial security even in adverse market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Robert and Susan felt confident enjoying a higher quality of life now while ensuring a meaningful inheritance for loved ones, striking the right [[balancing_spending_and_longterm_financial_security | balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

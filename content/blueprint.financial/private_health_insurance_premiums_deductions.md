In Canada, if you pay for private health insurance out-of-pocket, you may be able to deduct these premiums from your taxable income as a [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expense]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52">[05:52]</a>. This can help you keep more of your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18">[01:18]</a>.

## Eligibility

Eligible plans for deduction include those that cover medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57">[05:57]</a>.

## Non-Eligible Premiums

It's important to note that employer-paid premiums generally do not qualify for this deduction, unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02">[06:02]</a>.

## For Self-Employed Individuals

Premiums paid by self-employed individuals can also be claimed, provided they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08">[06:08]</a>.

## Family Plans

If you have a family plan, you may be able to claim premiums for your spouse and children, which can help maximize your total deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16">[06:16]</a>.

## Claiming the Deduction

The process for claiming private health insurance premiums is the same as for other [[medical_expense_tax_credits_in_canada | medical expense tax credits]] (MEC). To claim it, you must enter these expenses on line 33099 or 33199 of your tax return, depending on who the expense is for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41">[00:41]</a>.

### Calculation

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07">[01:07]</a>. Additionally, you must subtract the lower of 3% of your net income or $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12">[01:12]</a>.

### Example Calculation

Meet Mark, who earns $90,000 annually and pays $3,500 for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>.

*   **Mark's Income:** $90,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22">[06:22]</a>
*   **Total Premiums Paid:** $3,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24">[06:24]</a>

To calculate his eligible claim:
1.  Calculate 3% of his income: $90,000 * 3% = $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28">[06:28]</a>
2.  Subtract this amount from his total premiums: $3,500 - $2,700 = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33">[06:33]</a>

Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35">[06:35]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Keep detailed records of all your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44">[06:44]</a>. If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, verify which portion of your premiums is eligible for deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>.

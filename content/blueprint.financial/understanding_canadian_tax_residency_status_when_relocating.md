Leaving Canada means understanding your tax residency status to avoid unexpected tax obligations from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. If tax residency is not properly severed, you could still be considered a Canadian tax resident and owe taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Types of Tax Residency Status

When considering moving countries, there are four main types of tax residency status:

*   **Factual Resident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
    *   Someone who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties to the country, even if temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Emigrant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>
    *   An individual who leaves Canada permanently and severs significant residential ties with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   The CRA considers an individual an emigrant for tax purposes if they leave Canada and establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Non-Resident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
    *   An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | Non-residents]] do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but can be taxed on Canadian-sourced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Deemed Non-Resident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>
    *   When an individual qualifies as a tax resident in another country with a tax treaty, meaning Canada won't tax them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   The key difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident is how tax residency is determined and whether a tax treaty applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Special Warning for Snowbirds

If you spend more than 183 days in the US in a calendar year, you could be classified as a US tax resident and be subject to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Keeping track of your days is crucial, and apps like Day Count or TaxBird can help avoid crossing the 183-day limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Common Mistakes Affecting Tax Residency

### Mistake #1: Not Understanding Your Tax Residency Status

As outlined above, failing to clearly establish your residency status when leaving can result in remaining a Canadian tax resident and owing taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Mistake #3: Filing Form NR73 (Residency Determination Form)

Many assume filing Form NR73 will help confirm non-resident status with the CRA, but it can actually work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. A CRA official reviewing your case might determine you are still a Canadian tax resident, even if you believe you have cut ties completely, leading to continued taxation on worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Instead, consider:
*   Skipping Form NR73 as it's not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Filing a departure tax return, reporting your departure date, and paying any applicable [[navigating_departure_and_exit_taxes_for_canadians_moving_abroad | exit tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   Letting your actions prove non-residency by severing significant ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Mistake #4: Not Checking Tax Treaties and Tiebreaker Rules

When relocating from Canada, it's crucial to understand how tax treaties affect your tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Some countries have tax treaties with Canada that include tiebreaker rules to determine residency when both countries can claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Tax treaties typically use the following criteria to resolve dual residency:
1.  **Permanent Home**: Where do you have a permanent place of residence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
2.  **Center of Vital Interests**: Where are your personal and economic ties strongest, including family location, employment, and social connections? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
3.  **Habitual Abode**: In which country do you habitually reside? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
4.  **Physical Presence (183-day Rule)**: Some countries automatically consider you tax present if you spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

#### Example: Moving to the US

The US employs a "substantial presence test" to determine tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If you spend 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year, you could be considered a US tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, under the Canada-US tax treaty, tiebreaker rules can resolve dual residency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. If your permanent residence and center of vital interest are still in Canada, you may be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

For instance, Tiffany, a Canadian citizen working in New York for a year, meets the US substantial presence test by spending over 183 days there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Despite this, because her family and financial ties remain in Canada, she owns a home there, intends to return, and holds Canadian citizenship, Canada remains her primary tax residency under the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The US may tax her US income, but she can avoid being fully taxed as a US resident on her worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Mistake #5: Maintaining Significant Ties to Canada

The CRA assesses your residential ties to determine if you remain a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. If these ties are not properly severed, you may still be taxed on your worldwide income after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

#### Primary Residential Ties (Strongest Indicators)
*   **Home in Canada**: Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada**: If they remain, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada**: Such as children or other dependents living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Maintaining any of these ties strongly suggests you are still a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

#### Secondary Residential Ties (May Influence Status)
*   **Personal Property**: Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Social Ties**: Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Ties**: Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Canadian Documentation**: Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Mailing Address**: Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can classify you as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

#### How to Sever Residential Ties
*   **Selling or Renting Out Your Canadian Home**: Leasing it to unrelated parties demonstrates you have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Moving Your Family Abroad**: Bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Closing or Converting Canadian Financial Accounts**: Terminate accounts or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Updating Government Records**: Change your address, cancel health coverage, and surrender your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Mistake #7: Not Establishing Residency in a New Country Properly

Failing to secure legal residency in another country can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If you leave Canada without official tax residency status elsewhere, you may remain liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

Steps to properly establish residency elsewhere:
*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency**: Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Set Up Financial Ties**: Open a bank account, rent or buy a house, obtain an ID card, and register for health insurance in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in Your New Country**: Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Even after establishing non-resident status, certain [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Canadian-sourced income]] may remain taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

Leaving Canada doesn't mean leaving taxes behind. Without proper planning and understanding of tax residency, you could end up paying more than necessary or face double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Tax law involving two tax systems is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

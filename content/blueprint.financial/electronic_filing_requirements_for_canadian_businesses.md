Starting in 2025, significant changes to electronic filing requirements will impact Canadian businesses, particularly smaller ones or those still using manual methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## New Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) Rules

The new CRA rules for 2025 mandate the following:
*   Businesses that file six or more information returns (such as T4s or T5s) must file them electronically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Corporations with over $1 million in revenue are required to submit their T2 returns online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

While these changes may not affect established businesses that already file electronically, smaller businesses or those accustomed to manual filing processes will need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Actionable Steps for Businesses

To comply with these new requirements, businesses should ensure they have a "My Business Account" with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

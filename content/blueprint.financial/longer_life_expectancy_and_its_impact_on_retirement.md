Historically, the idea of retiring at 65 worked when homes were affordable and most people didn't live past 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, today, individuals can live 30 or more years in retirement, necessitating a more robust financial plan to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This shift is leading more Canadians to work past the traditional retirement age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## A Historical Look at Retirement Age

The average retirement age in Canada has seen significant changes over the past few decades:
*   In 1997, the average retirement age dipped to 60.9 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   By 2010, it had risen to 62.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   In 2020, it reached 64.3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   As of 2024, the average retirement age has climbed to 65.3 years, the highest in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This represents a four-year increase in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after that age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Reasons for Working Longer

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The reasons for this continued employment vary:
*   **By Choice**: Approximately 12% worked by choice to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Financial Necessity**: Another 9% worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
Interestingly, over half of retirees working past 65 did so by choice, indicating a shift in what retirement looks like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Retirement ages also vary by employment sector:
*   Public sector employees tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Private sector workers typically retire around 65 and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Self-employed Canadians often work the longest, retiring on average at nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Six Biggest Reasons for Working Longer

#### 1. Longer Life Expectancy
People are living longer than in the past, which significantly impacts retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy is not fixed; the older you get, the longer you are expected to live, as you've outlived various risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Average life expectancy projections for Canadians:
*   **At age 40**: Men can expect to live to 78, women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **At age 50**: Men are projected to live to 79, women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **At age 60**: Men are looking at about an 80.5-year life expectancy, women at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **At age 70**: Men reach about an 83.2-year life expectancy, women at 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

If healthy individuals reach age 65, they often have two or more decades ahead of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This means retirement is no longer a 10-year plan but a 20- to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and health management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

#### 2. Pension Coverage Changes
Defined benefit pensions, which offered predictable lifetime income, are becoming less common, particularly in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Instead, defined contribution plans are more prevalent, where retirement income depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Only 37.5% of paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning the majority must rely on personal savings like RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

#### 3. [[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effect_on_retirees | Rising Cost of Living]]
Retirees face increasing costs without a matching boost in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Shelter Costs**: As of February 2024, shelter costs were up 6.2% year-over-year, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Groceries**: Food prices have increased by over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: While public healthcare exists, out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

These costs make it challenging for those on fixed incomes, especially if they are renting, carrying debt, or supporting family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

#### 4. [[shifts_in_employment_and_retirement_views | Less Physical Work]]
Work has become less physically demanding. Historically, jobs in construction, manufacturing, or transportation often led to retirement due to physical strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Today, more Canadians work in knowledge-based or service jobs, often at a desk or from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job isn't physically taxing and individuals remain mentally sharp, there's less incentive to stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Work can also provide structure, identity, and social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

#### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
A generational mindset shift is occurring. For Boomers and Gen Xers, retirement is often seen as freedom, not necessarily cessation of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This could mean part-time consulting, teaching, freelancing, or starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Retirement is becoming more of a "ramp" â€” a slow transition into something flexible and personally fulfilling, rather than a "cliff" at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

#### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce," where Canadians over 50 get divorced, is increasing and reshaping retirement timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Late-life separations often trigger a major financial reset, involving asset splits, legal fees, and the need to support two households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This can lead to delaying retirement, downsizing, or re-entering the workforce to stay financially stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Uncertainty as a Retirement Killer
Even with sufficient savings, uncertainty can cause hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Volatile markets, unpredictable housing costs, and higher-than-expected inflation contribute to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tensions further add to concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Many Canadians delay retirement not out of necessity, but to gain peace of mind and build a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Strategic Retirement Planning

While working longer might seem like a solution to uncertainty, time is a valuable asset in retirement, especially one's healthy years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The goal should be to retire as early as safely possible to enjoy more healthy years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Case Study: Keanu's Retirement Scenario

Let's look at a scenario using financial planning software to illustrate how small adjustments can make a big difference for someone like Keanu, a 65-year-old single individual aiming for a modest lifestyle of $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Keanu earned $90,000 annually, has $400,000 in his RRSP, $100,000 in his TFSA, and his home is paid off, with no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | CPP]] and OAS are assumed to start at 65.

*   **Scenario 1: Retiring at 65 with immediate CPP/OAS and drawing savings**
    *   Keanu would run out of money by around age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His RRSP depletes quickly, and his TFSA cannot cover the remaining years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This highlights that $500,000 in savings may not be enough for 25+ years of retirement without a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

*   **Scenario 2: Working three more years but still taking CPP/OAS at 65**
    *   By working and saving for three more years, Keanu's money easily lasts through age 90, leaving him with an estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Just three extra years of work provide over a decade of financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

*   **Scenario 3: Working two more years and delaying [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | CPP]] to 70**
    *   If Keanu works two more years and delays CPP to 70 for a higher benefit, he still faces a shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Aggressive RRSP withdrawals between 67 and 69 to cover the gap drain his funds too quickly, leading to less money in later years despite stronger CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Delaying CPP is powerful, but needs a smart withdrawal strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

*   **Scenario 4: Working two more years, delaying [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | CPP]] to 70, and strategic RRSP withdrawals**
    *   Keanu retires at 67, delays CPP to 70, but draws gradually from his RRSP between 67 and 69, just enough to cover needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This [[strategies_for_extending_retirement_income | strategy for extending retirement income]] results in a steady income through retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

This example illustrates how the right sequencing of payments and withdrawals, combined with minor adjustments like working a bit longer and timing [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | CPP]] benefits, can create a functional retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

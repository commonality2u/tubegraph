The Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) is a tax credit designed to assist low-income Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Why Canadians Miss Out

Despite its intent, an estimated 240,000 eligible individuals do not claim the CWB annually, leading to approximately $175 million left unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Reasons for this oversight include:
*   **Complex Application** The CRA's application process can be complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Lack of Awareness** Many individuals are unaware that they qualify for the benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Paper Filing** Only half of those who file their taxes on paper claim the CWB, compared to those who use tax software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

For eligible low-income workers, the CWB is a valuable benefit that can provide significant financial assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

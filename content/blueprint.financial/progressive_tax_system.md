A progressive tax system is a tax structure where the tax rate increases as the taxable income increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that higher-income individuals or entities pay a larger percentage of their income in taxes compared to lower-income earners. The [[canadian_tax_structure | Canadian tax structure]] operates on this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## How it Works

Under a progressive tax system, income is divided into segments, known as [[understanding_tax_brackets | tax brackets]], with each bracket taxed at a different rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. When an individual's income crosses a certain threshold, only the portion of income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Any income earned below the threshold continues to be taxed at the previous, lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Common Misconceptions

A frequent [[myths_about_higher_tax_brackets | misconception]] about tax brackets is that if one's income moves into a higher bracket, their *entire* income will be taxed at the new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This leads to the incorrect belief that accepting a raise might result in "taking home less money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This is a "classic myth" regarding [[misconceptions_about_tax_rates | tax rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

> [!example]
> Consider an individual earning $56,000, taxed at a 15% federal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If offered a raise to $60,000, they might incorrectly assume their entire income will be taxed at the next bracket's rate of 20.5%, which applies to income above $57,375 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
>
> In reality:
> * The first $57,375 of their income would still be taxed at the 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
> * Only the income *above* $57,375 (i.e., $60,000 - $57,375 = $2,625) would be taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## [[Impact of Salary Increase on Taxes | Impact of Salary Increase]]

Due to the progressive nature of the tax system, it is [[financial_benefits_of_higher_income_despite_higher_tax_bracket | always financially beneficial to receive a raise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. An increased salary, even if it moves an individual into a higher tax bracket, will always result in a greater net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

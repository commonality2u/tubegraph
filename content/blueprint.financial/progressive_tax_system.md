Canada operates under a [[progressive_tax_system|progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This system ensures that as an individual's income increases, only the portion of their income that falls into a higher [[federal_tax_brackets|tax bracket]] is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Common Misconception About Raises and Taxes

A common myth is that receiving a salary raise might lead to taking home less money due to being "bumped" into a higher [[federal_tax_brackets|tax bracket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. For example, if someone's salary increases from $56,000 to $60,000, they might incorrectly believe that crossing the $57,375 threshold would mean their entire income is then taxed at the higher 20.5% rate instead of their previous 15% rate, resulting in less take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This is a "classic myth" about [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets|Canadian taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## How the Progressive Tax System Works

In a [[progressive_tax_system|progressive tax system]]:
*   Different portions of income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Income below a specific threshold remains taxed at the lower [[federal_tax_brackets|tax bracket]] rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* the threshold for a new [[federal_tax_brackets|tax bracket]] is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

For instance, if the threshold for a 20.5% [[federal_tax_brackets|tax bracket]] is $57,375, and an individual earns $60,000:
*   The income up to $57,375 is still taxed at the lower rate (e.g., 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Only the $2,625 earned above $57,375 (i.e., $60,000 - $57,375) is taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

> [!INFO] Always Better to Get a Raise
> Due to the [[progressive_tax_system|progressive tax system]], it is "always better to get a raise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. An increase in salary will always result in taking home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Comparison to Average Canadians

There is a stark contrast between the incomes of top earners and the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age | median income for Canadians by age group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The median income for most Canadians ranges between $35,000 and $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The highest median income for the 45-to-54 age group is still $51,500 below the top 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The top 5% threshold of $147,100 is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. To join the [[understanding_the_top_1_income_threshold_in_canada | top 1%]], one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25-to-34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Regardless of income level, the key to financial freedom and long-term [[household_net_worth_in_canada | wealth]] is what one does with their earnings, as exemplified by Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through consistent investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

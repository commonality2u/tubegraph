Even though all-in-one ETFs are designed to make investing easy, people often make mistakes that can negatively impact their returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Understanding and avoiding these [[common_investment_mistakes | common mistakes]] is crucial for successful long-term investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Not Honestly Assessing Your Risk Tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>
A significant pitfall is not honestly completing the investor questionnaire designed to determine your comfort level with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

*   **Risk of being too conservative:** If you are too conservative, your portfolio might not achieve enough growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Risk of being too aggressive:** Being too aggressive can lead to panic selling during a market downturn, causing you to sell at the wrong time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

It is essential to take these questionnaires seriously to ensure your chosen ETF matches your actual comfort level with risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. A quick way to assess your risk tolerance is by using free tools like the Vanguard investor questionnaire, which asks about your comfort with market swings, investment time horizons, and financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Over-Tweaking and Lack of Patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>
The primary advantage of all-in-one ETFs is their "set it and forget it" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. However, many investors frequently check their accounts and make unnecessary changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

*   **Impact of constant adjustments:** Continuously adjusting investments or selling all-in-one ETFs due to market swings can significantly harm long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Importance of patience:** Patience is a key virtue in investing, especially with a strategy designed for long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

As economist Paul Samuelson stated, investing should be "more like watching paint dry or watching grass grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Buying Too Many ETFs in the Same Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
Some investors mistakenly buy multiple all-in-one ETFs or combine them with other ETFs, believing it provides extra diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

*   **Disrupting built-in balance:** All-in-one ETFs are specifically designed to be standalone investments for each account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Adding more funds can disrupt their carefully designed balance and asset allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Unintended risk changes:** Each all-in-one ETF is built to match a specific risk level (aggressive, balanced, or growth-focused) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Mixing and matching can accidentally alter your intended risk exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Sufficient diversification:** An all-in-one ETF like Vanguard VGRO, for instance, already provides exposure to over 13,000 companies, offering more than enough diversification for most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

The recommendation is to choose one all-in-one ETF that aligns with your risk tolerance and stick with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

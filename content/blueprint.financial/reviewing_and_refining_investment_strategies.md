Periodically reviewing your investment portfolio is crucial for refining your approach and ensuring it aligns with your financial objectives for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>.

## Importance of Reviewing Investments

Investments are influenced by various factors such as market conditions, economic trends, and geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>. Reflecting on both successes and setbacks from the previous year is essential for making better financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:21">[02:18:21]</a>.

Understanding what worked and what didn't in your portfolio helps you make more resilient investment decisions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:03">[02:49:03]</a>.

*   **For a strong year:** If your investments performed well (e.g., earning 30% in a year), consider what drove that success. Was it diversification, strong stock picks, or favorable market conditions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>
*   **For experiencing losses:** Analyze the causes of losses. This could be due to overexposure to a certain sector, reacting emotionally to market dips, or insufficient diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:13">[02:36:13]</a>.

## How to Review and Refine Your Investment Strategy

### 1. Review Performance

Assess how each of your investments has performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>. Examine any underperforming sectors to determine if losses were due to broader trends or specific holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>.

### 2. Assess Allocation

Check if your portfolio's asset allocation reflects your financial goals and [[investment_strategies_based_on_risk_tolerance_and_time_horizon | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:07">[03:05:07]</a>. Evaluate if your portfolio is too equity-heavy or overly conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:41">[03:09:41]</a>.

### 3. Spot Cognitive Biases

Be aware of and avoid common investment pitfalls such as:
*   **Recency bias:** Overweighting recent market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.
*   **Loss aversion:** Focusing too much on avoiding losses rather than potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:07">[03:21:07]</a>.

> [!TIP] Focus on Long-Term Goals

### 4. Rebalance Your Portfolio

If your portfolio has become overweighted in one sector, consider rebalancing it at the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:25">[03:34:25]</a>.

### 5. Identify Opportunities

Explore sectors that demonstrate long-term growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:53">[03:43:53]</a>.

### 6. Document Your Strategy

Write a clear plan for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:50">[03:47:50]</a>. This plan should include when to rebalance your portfolio and how to manage volatility to stay focused and disciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:47">[03:50:47]</a>.

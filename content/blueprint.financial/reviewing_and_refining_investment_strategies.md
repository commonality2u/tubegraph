Periodically reviewing and refining your [[key_investment_strategies_and_options | investment strategies]] is crucial for financial success, similar to how the start of a new year is an ideal time to get finances in shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This process helps you adapt to changing market conditions, economic trends, and geopolitical events, allowing for better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Why Review Your Investments?
Reviewing your previous year's portfolio helps in refining your strategy for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Reflecting on both successes and setbacks is essential for making more resilient investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

If you had a strong year, analyze what drove that successâ€”whether it was diversification, strong stock picks, or favorable markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. If you experienced losses, analyze the causes, such as overexposure to a certain sector, emotional reactions to dips, or insufficient diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Understanding what worked and what didn't prepares you for future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## How to Review and Refine Your Strategy
1.  **Review Performance**: Assess how each investment has performed and examine underperforming sectors to determine if losses stemmed from broader trends or specific holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
2.  **Assess Your Allocation**: Check if your portfolio reflects your goals and [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation_based_on_risk_tolerance | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This involves ensuring it's not too equity-heavy or overly conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
3.  **Spot Cognitive Biases**: Avoid pitfalls like recency bias (over-weighting recent trends) or loss aversion (focusing too much on avoiding losses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> **Pro Tip**: When reviewing investments, focus on your long-term goals to avoid reacting emotionally to short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
4.  **Rebalance Your Portfolio**: If your portfolio is overweighted in one sector, rebalancing at the beginning of the year can help maintain your desired [[investment_strategies_and_asset_allocation_based_on_risk_tolerance | asset allocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
5.  **Identify Opportunities**: Explore sectors with long-term growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
6.  **Document Your Strategy**: Write a clear plan for the upcoming year, including when to rebalance and how to [[choosing_investments_and_managing_risk | manage volatility]] to stay focused and disciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Related Strategies for Investment Success
### Prioritize Contributions to Tax-Advantaged Accounts
Tax-advantaged accounts like TFSAs, FHSAs, and RRSPs offer significant tax savings and compounding growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Contributing early in the year allows investments more time to grow, helping build wealth, save for a home, or prepare for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is a key part of [[contribution_strategies_for_investments | contribution strategies for investments]].

*   **TFSA**: Aim to max out the annual contribution room for tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **FHSA**: Ideal for first-time home buyers, offering tax deductions similar to an RRSP and tax-free withdrawals for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **RRSP**: Perfect for high-income earners who expect a lower tax bracket in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Be mindful of contribution limits and deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **RESP (for children)**: Contribute regularly to maximize government grants (up to $500 annually per child) and tax-sheltered growth for education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

    *   <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a> **Pro Tip**: If a high-income earner, prioritize RRSP contributions for tax benefits, especially if an employer offers matching contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For moderate or low-income earners, focus on the TFSA for its flexibility and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. If saving for a home, use the FHSA for its unique tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Plan Your Tax Saving Strategies
Taxes are a significant expense, and proactive [[strategies_to_reduce_investment_taxes | tax planning]] helps reduce liability, allowing you to keep more of your money for your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This supports [[investing_strategies_for_increasing_net_worth | increasing net worth]]. Strategies include:
*   **Income Splitting**: Contribute to a spouse's RRSP or hire a family member for business work if self-employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Deductions**: Claim medical expenses, charitable contributions, childcare costs, moving expenses, and home office expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Tax Credits**: Look into tuition and education credits, the Canada Training Credit, and the disability tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> **Pro Tip**: Start early to organize receipts, statements, and expenses to maximize deductions and credits stress-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Set Clear Financial Goals and Automate
Clear financial goals provide purpose and direction, acting as a blueprint to prioritize and stay on track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Automation ensures consistent progress by removing the need for constant decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This is part of [[developing_an_investment_philosophy | developing an investment philosophy]].
1.  **Define Your Goals**: Make them specific and measurable (e.g., pay off $6,000 in credit card debt, save $5,000 for a vacation, build a $15,000 emergency fund, or contribute the full TFSA limit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
2.  **Break Goals into Milestones**: Instead of saving $12,000 for vacation, target $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
3.  **Automate Contributions**: Set automatic transfers for savings to high-interest accounts or TFSAs, use pre-authorized contributions for investments (RRSPs, FHSAs), and schedule debt payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> **Pro Tip**: Schedule contributions right after payday to prioritize savings and avoid spending the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Review Retirement Income and Benefits (for Retirees)
Retirement planning involves managing income sources, taxes, and benefits to ensure savings last and sustain your lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This also falls under [[strategies_for_improving_financial_position_across_different_wealth_classes | strategies for improving financial position]].
*   **CPP and OAS Optimization**: Consider delaying CPP to age 70 to increase payments by 42% for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Avoid OAS clawbacks by deferring OAS or adjusting income sources if income exceeds the threshold (e.g., $91,000 for 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Pension Splitting**: Split eligible pension income with a lower-income spouse to reduce household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **RRIF Withdrawals**: Withdraw strategically to avoid higher tax brackets and transfer excess withdrawals into a TFSA to further shelter growth from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Government Credits**: Claim the age credit, pension credit, and home accessibility tax credit for renovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning**: Update wills and beneficiaries to align with wishes and minimize estate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> **Pro Tip**: Stress test your plan for scenarios like market downturns (e.g., 20% drop) or unexpected medical costs (e.g., $10,000 annual expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

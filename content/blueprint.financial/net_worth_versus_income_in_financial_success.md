Understanding the difference between income and net worth is crucial for achieving significant financial success, especially when aiming to be among the top earners in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While income represents the money earned, net worth is the true measure of accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Top 1% Income in Canada

To be considered in the top 1% of income earners in Canada, the threshold income as of 2021 is $271,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. It's important to distinguish this threshold from the median income of the top 1%, which was $378,900 per year in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The median represents the middle point, effectively the top 0.5%, while the threshold is the bottom point of the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Key characteristics of the top 1% income earners in Canada include:
*   Approximately 80% are married or in common-law relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Wages and salaries account for 63.1% of their income in 2021, a slight increase from 62.7% in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This implies that about one-third of their income comes from sources other than their primary jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

Net worth is defined as total assets minus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While high income is a factor, net worth is considered the [[importance_of_net_worth_over_income | true measure of being in the top 1%]] financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

As of a 2021 PBO report, the threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This group comprises about 160,000 families in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Strategies for Achieving Top 1% Wealth

There are four primary [[strategies_for_increasing_personal_net_worth_using_financial_data | realistic strategies]] to accumulate the wealth needed to join Canada's top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### 1. High-Paying Profession
Earning close to the top 1% income threshold of $271,500 per year can lead to amassing significant wealth over a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Professions commonly achieving this income level include:
*   C-Suite level executives (CEO, CFO, CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Medical specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Partners in law and accounting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>
*   Investment bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Principal software engineers, senior data scientists, senior software architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Specialized dentists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>

This path often requires many years of specialized education and work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### 2. Starting a Business
Business ownership is a primary way the top 1% earn their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. While not easy, it is possible for anyone to start and scale a successful business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Canada's wealthiest individuals, such as Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify, have typically built their fortunes through business rather than 9-5 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Business ownership offers financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits like selling the business or going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The key to significant wealth accumulation in business is scaling, reaching hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Certain sales roles, like real estate agents, mortgage brokers, or pharmaceutical sales representatives, can also achieve 1% income levels, acting as a hybrid between salary and business ownership due to high commissions and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Mark Cuban emphasizes sales as the most important aspect of any business for generating revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### 3. Investing Wisely
Strategic investing is crucial for reaching the top 1% net worth, as it allows money to compound and grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

*   **Example**: Anne Scheiber, an IRS auditor, built a $22 million fortune by consistently investing modest savings in blue-chip stocks with solid dividends and holding them long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

For beginners, diversification is a good strategy, spreading investments across various asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Stock Market**: Consider index funds or ETFs for a hands-off approach, offering broad diversification at low costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Alternatively, learn to pick individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Fixed Income/Bonds**: Investing in bonds can reduce risk and complement stocks, providing steady growth while protecting against market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Real Estate**: A significant and popular wealth builder in Canada, investing in rental properties can provide income and property value appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Most millionaires include real estate in their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**: Utilize RSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plans), TFSAs (Tax-Free Savings Accounts), and FHSAs (First Home Savings Accounts) to enhance investment returns through tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### 4. Being Frugal and Saving
Living below one's means and consistently saving a significant portion of income can lead to substantial wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

*   **Example**: Ronald Reed, a janitor and gas station attendant, amassed an $8 million fortune by living frugally and consistently investing in blue-chip stocks over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This demonstrates that a large fortune can be built even with a low income by saving and investing wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

A caution is advised against "extreme frugality" that negatively impacts quality of life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Combining Strategies for Financial Success

It's common and often most effective to combine these methods rather than choosing just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The best approach depends on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

For instance:
*   Someone with a high-paying job who is risk-averse might combine wise investing with frugality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   A risk-taker who dislikes frugality might focus on starting and scaling a business and investing the profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Individuals with significant bills or family responsibilities might prioritize increasing salary through promotions or training, and then investing any surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Ultimately, having a solid financial plan is paramount for achieving significant wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

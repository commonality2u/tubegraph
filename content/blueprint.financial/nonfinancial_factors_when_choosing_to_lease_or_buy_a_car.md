The decision to lease or buy a car often involves unpredictable financial estimates, making non-financial factors potentially more important [10:29]. The car market is inherently unpredictable [10:14], and it is nearly impossible to forecast its shifts [10:27]. Therefore, considering personal preferences and practical aspects can outweigh speculative financial projections [10:29].

### Ownership Preference
Your preference for ownership plays a significant role.
*   **Buying:** Best suited for those who desire long-term ownership and the freedom to customize their vehicle [10:45].
*   **Leasing:** Ideal if you prefer to drive a new model every few years [10:49].

### Tax Write-offs
For business owners, tax implications are a key consideration [10:59].
*   **Leasing:** Offers deductible payments [10:51].
*   **Buying:** Allows for depreciation and interest deductions [10:54]. The choice should align with your business's financial strategy [10:58].

### Debt Aversion
Your comfort level with debt is another factor.
*   **Leasing:** Generally involves lower monthly payments without the burden of long-term debt, but you build no equity [11:02]. It may feel less burdensome if avoiding debt is a priority [11:07]. However, leasing often comes with higher overall payments than buying [11:11].

### Flexibility
Consider how much freedom you want with your vehicle.
*   **Buying:** Provides the flexibility to sell the car at any time [11:16].
*   **Leasing:** Locks you into a specific term, but it may include conveniences such as warranty coverage [11:18].

### Long-Term Plans
Your intentions for the car's duration are important.
*   **Buying:** Advisable if you plan to keep the car for many years [11:24].
*   **Leasing:** More suitable if you prefer frequent vehicle changes [11:27].

### Environmental or Emotional Factors
Your personal values and emotional attachment to a vehicle can also influence the decision.
*   **Buying:** Can support sustainability goals and foster a sense of attachment to the vehicle [11:31].
*   **Leasing:** Provides access to the latest eco-friendly models due to higher turnover, though it might not feel as personal [11:35].

### Maintenance
Maintenance responsibilities differ between the two options.
*   **Buying:** You are responsible for covering all maintenance costs post-warranty [11:42].
*   **Leasing:** Maintenance is often included during the lease term [11:44].

### Insurance Costs
Insurance expenses can vary.
*   Leased vehicles can potentially require higher insurance premiums, which might increase overall costs compared to buying [11:49].

### End of Lease Options
The options available at the end of the term are crucial.
*   **Leasing:** Offers the flexibility to buy the car at the end of the term, which can be beneficial if you are initially unsure about committing to a purchase [11:56].

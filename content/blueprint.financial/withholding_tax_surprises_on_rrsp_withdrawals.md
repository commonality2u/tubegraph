A common regret among Canadians is underestimating the automatic withholding tax applied to [[Impact of RSP withdrawals on taxes | RRSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Many mistakenly assume that the tax will only be owed at filing time, not realizing that a portion is deducted upfront, leaving them with less cash than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This often leads to a "nasty surprise" at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## The Automatic Withholding Tax

Banks automatically withhold a percentage of RRSP withdrawals based on the amount being taken out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The specific withholding rates depend on the size of the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

### Jeff's Emergency Withdrawal

Jeff withdraws $10,000 to cover an emergency expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. His bank withholds 20% ($2,000), meaning he only receives $8,000, with the $2,000 going directly to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. However, when Jeff files his taxes, his marginal tax rate is higher than the 20% withheld, requiring him to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Maria's Vacation Withdrawal

Maria, a retiree, withdraws $25,000 for a vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Her bank automatically withholds 30% ($7,500), leaving her with $17,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. At tax time, because her income rate is higher than 30%, she is forced to pay another $2,500 beyond what was already deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Key Takeaway
Many people regret assuming that the withholding tax was the final amount owed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This unexpected additional tax liability makes early [[RRSP inflexibility and withdrawal tax consequences | RRSP withdrawals]] far less appealing than they might initially seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to understand these [[Tax implications of RRSP withdrawals | tax implications of RRSP withdrawals]] and plan accordingly before contributing to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

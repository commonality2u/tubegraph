A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a powerful wealth-building tool, but it comes with strict restrictions on what types of investments can be held within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Failing to adhere to these rules can result in significant penalties and taxes from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## What Constitutes a Prohibited Investment?

Your TFSA is not a "free-for-all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The CRA has clear restrictions on what you can invest in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. [[nonqualified_investments_in_tfsa | Nonqualified investments in TFSA]] fall under the category of prohibited investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Key types of prohibited investments include:
*   **Significant Interest Holdings** Owning 10% or more of a private company's shares is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Non-Arms Length Relationships** Investments in businesses where you or your family have significant control or influence are banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## CRA's Objective

The CRA's primary objective in enforcing these rules is to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. By doing so, they ensure that TFSAs remain tools for legitimate, arms-length investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The penalties for holding [[nonqualified_investments_in_tfsa | prohibited investments in a TFSA]] are severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The CRA is "not messing around" with these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **50% Special Tax** If your TFSA acquires a prohibited investment, you will face a tax equal to 50% of the fair market value of the investment at the time it was acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains** Any income or capital gains earned from prohibited investments are taxed at 100%, effectively eliminating any benefit from holding these investments in your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Common Example

Consider an example where you invest $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. If the business grows and your shares are worth $50,000, the CRA could deem the investment prohibited due to your close connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The result would be a 50% tax on the $50,000 value ($25,000), and the shares would need to be removed from your TFSA, meaning future gains would no longer be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## How to Stay Safe

To avoid [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | CRA penalties on TFSA investments]] related to prohibited investments, it is crucial to consult the CRA's guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Review the list of qualified investments provided by the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Due to the steep penalties, always ensure you are investing only in assets that qualify for a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

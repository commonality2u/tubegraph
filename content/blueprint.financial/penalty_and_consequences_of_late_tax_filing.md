Filing your taxes is not just about paperwork; it's about keeping more of your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, failing to file on time can lead to significant financial penalties and delayed benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Consequences of Filing Late

The deadline for filing taxes is April 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Missing this date can result in various penalties:

### Penalties If You Owe Taxes
If you owe taxes to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and file late, you will incur:
*   A 5% penalty on the unpaid balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   An additional 1% penalty per month on the unpaid balance until it is settled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Even if you cannot pay your taxes immediately, it is crucial to file on time to avoid these penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Delayed Benefits and Refunds
Even if you do not owe any taxes, filing late can:
*   Delay your tax refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Delay benefits such as the GST/HST credit, Canada Child Benefit, and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Increased Penalties for Repeated Offenses
If you repeatedly file late, the penalties imposed by the CRA can increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Related Pitfalls and Penalties

While directly related to filing, other common [[common_tax_filing_mistakes_to_avoid | tax filing mistakes]] can also lead to penalties and audits:

### Forgetting to Report All Income
The CRA has access to various income records (e.g., T4s, T5s) and cross-checks them against your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Forgetting to report employment income, rental income, side hustle earnings, or investment dividends can lead to penalties and a potential audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and Etsy now directly report income to the CRA, meaning unreported earnings can trigger an automatic reassessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

If you fail to report $500 or more in income on your current tax return, and you previously missed reporting income in any of the past three years, the CRA may impose a penalty of 10% of the unreported income (5% federally and 5% provincially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Failing to Pay Installments if Required
Certain individuals, such as self-employed individuals, landlords, investors, and high-income earners, may be required to make quarterly tax installment payments if they owe more than $3,000 in taxes (or $1,800 in Quebec) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Missing these payments can result in:
*   Interest charges: The CRA charges compound daily interest on unpaid amounts from the installment due date until the balance is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   Additional penalties: An extra penalty may be applied if your installment interest charges for the year exceed $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This penalty is 50% of the amount by which your installment interest exceeds the greater of $1,000 or 25% of the installment interest you would have paid if no installments were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Not Reporting Foreign Assets or Cryptocurrency
If you hold over $100,000 in foreign assets (including stocks, real estate, or offshore bank accounts), you must file a T1135 foreign asset disclosure form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Failure to do so can result in hefty penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Unreported gains from selling or trading cryptocurrency can also lead to a tax audit, as some crypto exchanges now report transactions to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## How to Avoid Mistakes

To avoid [[common_tax_filing_mistakes_to_avoid | costly tax mistakes]]:

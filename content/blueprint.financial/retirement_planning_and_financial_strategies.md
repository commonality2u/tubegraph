The traditional notion of retiring at 65, when houses were inexpensive and life expectancy was shorter, is no longer practical in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Today, individuals may live 30 or more years in retirement, necessitating a well-structured [[comprehensive_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial plan]] to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. More Canadians are now working past the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Trend Towards Later Retirement in Canada

The average retirement age in Canada has significantly increased over the past few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>:
*   **1997**: Average retirement age was 60.9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **2010**: Crept up to 62.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **2020**: Reached 64.3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **2024**: Climbed to 65.3 years, the highest in nearly half a century, marking a four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Of these, 12% worked by choice to stay active and fulfilled, while 9% worked out of [[strategies_for_managing_retirement_on_limited_income | financial necessity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Retirement Age by Sector
Different employment sectors exhibit varying average retirement ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:
*   **Public sector employees**: Tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Private sector workers**: Hold out until about 65 and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Self-employed Canadians**: Push retirement even further, averaging nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Six Key Reasons for Later Retirement

Several factors contribute to the trend of Canadians working longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>:

### 1. Longer Life Expectancy
While good news, increased longevity significantly impacts [[importance_of_retirement_planning | retirement planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy is not fixed; it increases the older one gets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For example, if a Canadian reaches 65 years old and is healthy, they can expect to live two more decades or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means retirement is now a 20 to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and health management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### 2. Changes in Pension Coverage
Defined benefit pensions, which offered a predictable income for life, are becoming less common, particularly in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Defined contribution plans are more prevalent, where retirement income depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning the majority must rely on personal savings like RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Retirees face surging costs without a matching boost in income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   **Shelter Costs**: As of February 2024, shelter costs were up 6.2% year-over-year, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Groceries**: Food prices have increased over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: While public healthcare exists, out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Taxes**: Can significantly reduce retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Strategies exist to manage these costs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 4. Work Has Become Less Physical
Historically, physically demanding jobs meant bodies often dictated retirement age by 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, more Canadians now work in knowledge-based or service jobs that are less physically taxing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job is not physically demanding and one remains mentally sharp, there is less incentive to stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
A generational mindset shift is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For many, retirement is about freedom, which doesn't necessarily mean never working again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. It can involve consulting part-time, teaching, freelancing, or starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Retirement is often viewed as a gradual transition rather than an abrupt stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection, which many retirees miss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" is increasingly impacting retirement timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Late-life separations often lead to major financial resets, including asset division, legal fees, and the need to support two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This can force individuals to delay retirement, downsize, or re-enter the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## Uncertainty and its Impact on Retirement Decisions
Even with sufficient savings on paper, market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, higher-than-planned inflation, and rising healthcare expenses create uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This general anxiety leads many Canadians to delay retirement, not out of necessity, but to achieve peace of mind and a sense of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Relying solely on CPP, OAS, and savings feels riskier than in the past, prompting individuals to work longer and build a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### The Value of Time in Retirement
While delaying retirement for security can seem prudent, it has a trade-off: time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Time is the most valuable asset in retirement, and its value increases as one has less of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Therefore, retiring as early as safely possible is advocated to reclaim time and enjoy more healthy years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Retirement Planning Scenarios: Keanu's Case Study
To illustrate the [[importance_of_strategic_retirement_planning | power of strategic financial planning]], a scenario using financial planning software for a retiree named Keanu is presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Keanu is 65, single, and aims for a modest lifestyle, spending $50,000 per year in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. He earned $90,000 annually and has $400,000 in his RRSP and $100,000 in his TFSA, with a paid-off home but no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. CPP and OAS are assumed to start at 65 unless otherwise noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Retiring Cold Turkey at 65
If Keanu retires immediately at 65, starts collecting CPP and OAS, and lives off his savings, he would run out of money by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His RRSP depletes quickly, and his TFSA cannot cover the remaining needs, leading to negative net worth in his mid-80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This highlights that $500,000 in savings may not be sufficient for a 25-year retirement without a solid plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Working Three More Years
By working an additional three years, earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save, while still taking CPP and OAS at 65, Keanu's money easily lasts through age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He finishes with a net estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Just three extra years of work provide over a decade of financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP to 70
In this version, Keanu works two more years (until age 67) and delays starting CPP until age 70, which significantly increases his monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. However, this strategy still results in a shortfall because he aggressively draws from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69 to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The RRSP drains too quickly, leaving less for later years despite stronger CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Delaying CPP is powerful, but requires a smart withdrawal [[financial_strategies_for_retirement | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP to 70, and Strategic RRSP Withdrawals
This optimized scenario involves Keanu retiring at 67 and delaying CPP to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Crucially, he draws gradually from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69, just enough to cover his needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This combination results in a steady income throughout retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate of over $500,000 remaining by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This balance is achieved by working two years longer, delaying CPP, and strategically managing RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

These scenarios illustrate that even small adjustments in working years, CPP timing, and withdrawal [[effective_strategies_for_canadian_retirees_to_manage_retirement_savings | strategies]] can make a significant difference in a retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. A well-crafted plan can help individuals avoid needing to double savings or work until age 70, instead creating a functional plan by tweaking key levers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

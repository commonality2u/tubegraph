Starting and operating a business, such as the financial education website Wealth Awesome, comes with various [[selling_a_business_and_new_ventures | challenges]] and learning opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The journey from initial concept to a profitable and successful venture is often demanding and requires significant personal and professional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## Initial Hurdles and Learning Curve
The path to generating income from a new venture, like blogging, is not always easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. It took approximately a year from the website's launch in September 2019 to earn the first $50 affiliate commission in November 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By that point, over 150 articles had been written, and hundreds of hours had been invested, highlighting the significant initial effort for minimal financial return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Initially, a business owner may need to acquire numerous technical skills they didn't possess, including:
*   Website design and building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   Search engine optimization (SEO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
*   Content writing and graphic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
*   Website data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   Building an affiliate partner network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
*   Website monetization strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
*   Hiring and managing people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
*   Utilizing countless online tools to manage the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>

## Managing the Ups and Downs
One of the most critical lessons learned in business is how to manage the inherent challenges and fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. It's common to be reactive to good or bad results, leading to upset when things go poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, learning to "ride out the bad results" and continue working is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Key realizations include:
*   **Unpredictability:** No matter how well a business owner performs, there will be issues, and results may not always align with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Self-doubt:** There will be moments when one questions their motives and purpose for starting the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Inability to fix everything:** When running a business, problems will arise, and not all of them can be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Developing mental toughness:** This is arguably the most crucial skill to acquire, as it allows for perseverance through difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## External Factors and Loss of Passion
Timing and luck can play a significant role in a business's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. For example, starting a personal finance site right before a period like the COVID-19 pandemic, when more people were at home and seeking online information, proved to be fortunate timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. While external factors are uncontrollable, one can control their reaction to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

After several years, a business owner may also face a loss of passion for their venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This can lead to difficulty in motivating oneself to produce quality content and a general decrease in excitement about the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Recognizing when the "fire" is gone is a valuable lesson, indicating it might be time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Holding on too long to a business after losing passion can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Uncertainty about the future direction of the business can also be a significant source of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This includes concerns about the future of industries like blogging due to advancements in AI, shifts towards video content, and unpredictable algorithm updates from platforms like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. These factors can lead to a desire to diversify or exit the business entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

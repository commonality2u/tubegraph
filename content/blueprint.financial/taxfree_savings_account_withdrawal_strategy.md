## Timing Your Withdrawals for Maximized Contribution Room

When withdrawing funds from a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), it is crucial to do so before December 31st of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This timing allows the equivalent withdrawn amount to be added back to your contribution room for the *following* year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Impact of Withdrawal Timing

*   **Withdrawal Before December 31st**: Any amount withdrawn before the end of the year frees up that same contribution room for the next calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal in January (or later)**: If you wait until January to withdraw, you will have to wait an *entire additional year* to regain that contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> If you need to withdraw $5,000 for an emergency or a significant purchase, withdrawing it before December 31st ensures you can re-contribute that same $5,000 in the subsequent year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Delaying a withdrawal could lead to a loss of valuable contribution space, thereby limiting your ability to grow your investments tax-free over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

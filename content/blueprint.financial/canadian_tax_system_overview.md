The Canadian tax system operates on a [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | progressive tax system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates.

## Understanding Progressive Taxation

A common misconception is that if one's income crosses into a higher [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | tax bracket]], their entire income will be taxed at that new, higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. For example, an individual earning $56,000 and currently in a 15% [[federal_tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]] might incorrectly assume that a raise to $60,000 would cause their entire $60,000 to be taxed at the next bracket's 20.5% rate once they cross the $57,375 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, leading to less take-home pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### How it Actually Works

Under Canada's progressive tax system:
*   Only the income *above* a specific threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Any income below that threshold continues to be taxed at the lower, original rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This means that receiving a raise or increasing income will always result in taking home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Starting to invest can be a confusing part of personal finance due to conflicting opinions and advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Instead of rigid rules, a five-step framework can help anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The first and most important step in an investment journey is [[setting_and_automating_financial_goals | developing your investment philosophy]] by starting with "the why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Investing with Purpose

Many people dive into investing simply because they feel it's something they should be doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. However, investing without purpose is likened to setting sail without a destination or compass, leading to aimless drifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

It is crucial to have a clear purpose for investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This purpose could include goals such as:
*   Saving for a down payment on a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   [[defining_retirement_goals_and_lifestyle_planning | Retiring comfortably]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Achieving [[setting_and_automating_financial_goals | financial freedom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Funding your education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Providing for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The more specific and personal your reasons are, the stronger your investment foundation will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. For example, the speaker's personal purpose for investing is about freedom â€“ the freedom to live life on their own terms and the confidence that comes with financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Building investments to a point where money is not a constant worry has made a significant difference in their personal life, allowing them to take calculated risks and stay consistent with their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Knowing Your "Why"

*   Make decisions aligned with your long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

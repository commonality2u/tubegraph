The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) offers a children's benefit, providing financial support to eligible children after the loss of a contributing parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit can be especially helpful for covering expenses, including education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Eligibility

To qualify for the CPP children's benefit, the child must meet specific criteria:
*   The child must be under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Alternatively, the child can be between 18 and 25 years old and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   The benefit is available for both biological and adopted children of the deceased contributing parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Benefit Amount

For 2024, the CPP child benefit provides a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is a set figure and is not determined by the earnings of the surviving parent or the deceased spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## How to Apply

The application process for the children's benefit is straightforward and similar to applying for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_application | CPP survivorship pension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Applications can be made through Service Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Supporting documents, such as proof of enrollment in school for children aged 18 to 25, will be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Tax Implications

The CPP children's benefit, along with the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_application | survivorship pension]] and [[cpp_death_benefit_and_its_tax_implications | death benefit]], is considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Recipients must report these benefits on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

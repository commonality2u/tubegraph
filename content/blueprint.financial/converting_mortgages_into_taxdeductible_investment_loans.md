In Canada, standard mortgage interest is not tax-deductible, unlike in other countries like the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. However, a legal strategy exists to convert a non-deductible mortgage into a deductible investment loan over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This is achieved by reborrowing against home equity and investing the funds in income-generating assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) permits interest deductions on loans used for investments, but not on primary mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. By "recycling" mortgage payments into an investment loan, homeowners can take advantage of this legal tax loophole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## How It Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>

This strategy involves a continuous process to gradually transform a non-deductible mortgage into a deductible one:

1.  **Make Regular Mortgage Payments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>: Each month, a portion of your mortgage payment reduces the principal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
2.  **Reborrow the Principal Amount** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>: If you have a readvanceable mortgage, the principal amount paid off becomes available in a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
3.  **Invest Borrowed Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>: The funds borrowed from the HELOC must be used to purchase income-generating investments, such as dividend stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
4.  **Claim Tax Deduction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>: Since the money borrowed from the HELOC is used for investments, the interest paid on the HELOC becomes tax-deductible, thereby reducing your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
5.  **Repeat the Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>: By repeating these steps monthly, your mortgage can gradually be converted into a fully tax-deductible investment loan, while simultaneously growing your investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Example Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>

Consider David, who has a $500,000 mortgage with a $2,000 monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   If $800 of his payment goes towards reducing the principal, this $800 becomes available in his HELOC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   David then borrows this $800 from the HELOC and invests it in dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   By consistently reborrowing and investing monthly, David converts his mortgage into an investment loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   The interest on the HELOC is now tax-deductible, reducing his annual taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   This allows David to simultaneously invest and reduce his taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Risks and Downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

While attractive, this strategy carries significant risks:

*   **Interest Rate Risk** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>: HELOCs typically have variable interest rates. If rates increase, borrowing costs rise, making the strategy less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Market Volatility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>: If investments underperform or lose money, you are still obligated to pay interest on the HELOC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For example, if David's portfolio earns 10% he benefits, but if it drops 20% he still owes HELOC interest, potentially leading to a dangerous financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Discipline Required** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>: To maintain the tax deduction, the HELOC money must be consistently reinvested and not used for personal expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Failure to do so can result in serious financial and tax issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **CRA Scrutiny** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>: The CRA mandates that borrowed funds must be used for income-generating investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. If investments do not generate income (e.g., growth stocks with no dividends), the tax deduction may be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Considerations and Cautions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>

This strategy is most effective in a low-interest rate environment, where borrowing costs are minimal compared to potential investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. With interest rates in Canada potentially starting to drop, it could become more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

However, this is not a strategy suitable for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. It requires a high level of comfort with leverage and investment risk, alongside strict financial discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

It's crucial to remember that tax laws can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Before implementing any significant financial moves, always verify the latest CRA rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Consulting a tax professional is highly recommended to ensure proper implementation and to [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | maximize tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

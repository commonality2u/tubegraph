Donating to registered charities by December 31st can help reduce your tax bill through the charitable donation tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Federal and Provincial Credits

The Federal Credit provides a 15% credit on the first $200 donated, and 29% on amounts exceeding $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Additional provincial credits vary by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For instance, Alberta offers a 60% donation tax credit on the first $200 donated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If you donate $100 in Alberta, you would receive the 15% federal tax credit plus the 60% provincial tax credit, resulting in a $75 tax credit on that $100 donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

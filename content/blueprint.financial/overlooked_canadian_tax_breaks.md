Many Canadians miss out on tax breaks they are entitled to, despite the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) offering hundreds of tax deductions and credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This guide highlights some of the most commonly overlooked tax breaks that could return significant money to your pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## For Individuals and Families

### Canada Workers Benefit (CWB)
The CWB is designed to assist low-income Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. An estimated 240,000 eligible individuals fail to claim it annually, resulting in $175 million left unclaimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The application process can be complicated, and many are unaware they qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Paper filers are less likely to claim it compared to those using tax software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Pension Income Splitting
Retired individuals with a spouse in a lower tax bracket can save thousands by splitting pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This allows transferring up to 50% of pension income to a spouse, which lowers the overall household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Despite the potential savings, many retirees do not utilize this benefit, either due to lack of awareness or a mistaken assumption that it's automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. To claim, you must fill out form T1032 with your tax return each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: If you are nearing retirement, plan early to strategically adjust pension withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Moving Expenses Deduction
If you moved at least 40 km closer to a new job or school, you might be able to deduct moving expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These include travel, storage, and even temporary accommodations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Many people miss out because they forget to track their receipts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: You can only deduct moving costs against income earned at the new location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If you moved but haven't started work or school, you'll need to wait to claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Spousal RRSP Contributions
Couples often overlook contributing to a spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) instead of solely maximizing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This strategy helps distribute retirement income more evenly, which can significantly reduce future taxes, especially if one spouse earns considerably more than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. You still receive an immediate tax deduction, but when the money is withdrawn later, it is taxed at your spouse's potentially lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Home Buyer Amount
First-time home buyers may be eligible for the non-refundable Home Buyer's Amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. As of 2022, eligible buyers can claim up to $10,000, translating to a tax reduction of up to $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Many first-time buyers are unaware of this credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Home Office Expense Deduction
With the increase in remote work, employees and self-employed individuals can claim expenses related to their home workspace, such as rent, utilities, and internet costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many eligible taxpayers miss this deduction due to a lack of awareness or perceived complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. In the 2023 tax season, Canadians claimed $2.08 billion in home office expenses, a 41% increase from the previous year, but many still miss out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Tuition and Education Credits
Students can claim these credits to offset the cost of post-secondary education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Unused credits can also be transferred to a spouse, parent, or grandparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Many students and families are unaware or unsure how to claim them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The credit applies to post-secondary tuition fees, provided the school is on the CRA's designated list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Child Care Expense Deduction
Parents can deduct costs for daycare, nannies, and certain educational programs, up to a specified limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Many parents fail to claim these due to inadequate recordkeeping or lack of awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The deduction is typically claimed by the lower-income spouse and applies only to expenses incurred to allow the parent to work, study, or run a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Charitable Donations Tax Credit
Donating to a registered charity can provide a tax credit of up to 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. If not claimed immediately, unused donations can be carried forward for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Many Canadians forget to claim their charitable donations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip**: Gather your donation receipts in one place now to avoid scrambling at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Student Loan Interest Credit
Interest paid on government student loans is eligible for a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Many graduates forget to claim it, especially since financial institutions may no longer send automatic interest statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. If not claimed in previous years, it can be carried forward for up to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This credit applies only to government student loans; private loans and lines of credit do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC)
Seniors and individuals with disabilities can claim the HATC for home renovations that improve accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. You can claim up to $20,000 in eligible expenses, providing a 15% tax credit, up to a maximum benefit of $3,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Many eligible individuals are unaware of this credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Renters's Tax Credit
Certain provinces offer tax credits for renters to help offset housing costs, with specific criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Ontario**: The Ontario Trillium Benefit (OTB) considers your rent, income, and age for eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Manitoba**: Renters can claim up to $525 per year through the Education Property Tax Credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Quebec**: Offers a solidarity tax credit, which includes a housing component for low-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
If you work from home, you may also be able to deduct part of your rent as a home office expense under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Always keep receipts as proof may be requested by the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Eligible Dependent Amount
If you are single, divorced, or widowed and support a dependent, you might receive the eligible dependent amount, a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This credit can significantly reduce taxable income, but many Canadians overlook it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. To qualify, the dependent must be a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother, or sister who is either under 18 or has a physical or mental impairment, and must have lived with you in a home you maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Tutoring Services Tax Credit (as Medical Expense)
If your child has a learning disability, you may claim tutoring expenses as a medical expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. To qualify, a medical practitioner must certify in writing that these services are required due to the child's condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The tutoring must be provided by someone in the business of offering such services and not related to the student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Many parents are unaware of this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## For Businesses and Investors

### Meals and Entertainment Deduction
Self-employed individuals can deduct 50% of eligible meals and entertainment expenses incurred for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. While many business owners are aware, they often fail to meticulously track these expenses, leading to missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Maintaining detailed records is crucial for significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Carrying Charges Deduction
Investors can deduct fees paid for investment advice and interest on loans used to earn investment income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Many overlook these deductions, missing potential tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Reviewing financial statements and consulting a tax professional can help identify and claim these expenses, reducing taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, management fees paid to investment management partners are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid Missing Tax Breaks

Filing taxes doesn't have to be costly, and the right tools can automatically identify missed deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Utilizing Software and CRA Resources
*   **Use Free Tax Software**: Programs like Well Simple Tax and TurboTax Free can flag missing credits and deductions and guide you through your return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Check CRA My Account**: You can review past tax returns and amend them for a certain period if you missed a tax credit in previous years, potentially getting money back retroactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Use Autofill**: Many tax programs can directly pull your tax slips (e.g., T4s, RRSP contributions) from the CRA, reducing errors and ensuring nothing is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Setting Up Simple Tracking Systems
Most people miss deductions not because they don't qualify or are unaware, but because they forget to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The key is to set up simple systems:
*   **Receipt Scanning Apps**: Apps like Expensify or QuickBooks can automatically track receipts by scanning them with your phone, eliminating the need to dig through physical records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Tax Receipts Email Folder**: Create a dedicated email folder (e.g., for each year) to easily store tax-related documents that arrive via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Quick Tax Deductions Checklist**: Before filing each year, run through a simple checklist of common deductions like home office, medical expenses, and investment fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This quick review can save hundreds or thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. A spreadsheet can be useful for this, copied and updated annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

By proactively tracking expenses and utilizing available tools and strategies, Canadians can avoid leaving money on the table and ensure they claim every tax break they are entitled to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Many investors believe that as long as their mutual fund is making money, they are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, a significant issue with mutual funds is their tendency to [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_versus_benchmarks | underperform their benchmarks]], quietly eroding potential wealth even if the account balance is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For instance, earning 10% in a year might seem good, but if the benchmark returned 20%, the fund is significantly underperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Identifying Underperformance

To determine if a mutual fund is underperforming, it should be compared against its relevant benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Examples of benchmarks include:
*   The S&P TSX Composite Index for Canadian equity funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The S&P 500 for US equity large-cap funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Every mutual fund typically lists its benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A simple way to evaluate performance is by checking Morningstar, which provides detailed historical returns, quartile rankings, and comparisons to its category and benchmark index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Examples of Underperformance

### Scotia Selected Balance Growth Portfolio Series A
This fund, with $4 billion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, has consistently [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_versus_benchmarks | underperformed its benchmark]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Growth of $10,000**: Over its history, $10,000 invested in the fund grew to $16,458, while the index grew to $18,814 and its category to $17,079 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Quartile Rankings**:
    *   2024: Fourth quartile (bottom 25% of its category) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   3-year and 5-year: Third quartile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   10-year: Third quartile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Trailing Returns (Fund vs. Index)**:
    *   1 year: 8.62% vs. 11.42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   3 years annualized: ~5% vs. 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   5 years annualized: 5.14% vs. 6.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   10 years annualized: 4.6% vs. 6.01% (trailing the index by 1.41% per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

An investor with $100,000 in this fund for a decade could have missed out on potentially tens of thousands of dollars in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### TD Canadian Equity Fund
This $7.4 billion fund markets itself as actively managed but its performance and holdings closely track the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Underperformance**: Over 10 years, this fund returned 6.87% annually while the index returned 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Impact**: An investor with $100,000 in this fund could have missed over $20,000 in potential gains over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## The Broader Problem in Canada

The SPIVA Canada Mid-Year 2024 Report confirms that most actively managed funds in Canada [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_versus_benchmarks | underperform their benchmarks]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Short-term**: Two-thirds of Canadian equity funds underperformed their benchmarks in the first half of 2024 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Long-term**: Over a 10-year period, a staggering 93.4% of actively managed Canadian equity funds failed to beat their benchmark, meaning only about 6% succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

The longer an investor holds onto an underperforming fund, the larger the performance gap becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Impact on Investors

A common mistake is focusing only on positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If a fund grew by 3% in a year when the market grew by 10%, the investor effectively lost 7% in missed gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This underperformance is compounded by [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees associated with mutual funds]], which can significantly eat into returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Furthermore, many mutual funds engage in [[closet_indexing_in_mutual_funds | closet indexing]], where they track an index closely while charging the high fees of an actively managed fund, leading investors to pay more for index-like returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This contributes to the overall [[negative_impact_of_mutual_funds_on_wealth_growth | negative impact of mutual funds on wealth growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Alternatives to Underperforming Mutual Funds

To avoid [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_versus_benchmarks | underperforming mutual funds]], investors can consider alternatives:
*   **Switching Fund Series**: If not receiving real advice, consider switching from a Series A fund (which includes hidden advisor fees) to a Series F fund (lower cost version without embedded advisor commissions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. These are typically accessible through discount brokerages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **ETFs**: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) generally have much lower Management Expense Ratios (MERs), often starting as low as 0.05% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. They tend to outperform mutual funds due to their low-fee approach and can be more tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Robo-advisors**: Automated investment platforms like Wealthsimple provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Fee-only financial planners**: These professionals put the investor's interest first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers**: For active management, professional portfolio managers offer customized strategies with all-in fees ranging from 0.5% to 1.4%, often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

Investors should prioritize their financial future over loyalty to a bank or advisor, especially if their investments are not serving their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

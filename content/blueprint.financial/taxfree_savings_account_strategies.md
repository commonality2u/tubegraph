Managing your [[TaxFree Account Flexibility and Simplicity | Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)]] effectively before year-end can be a key part of [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | tax-saving strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Year-End Withdrawals for Contribution Room
If you anticipate needing to withdraw funds from your TFSA, it is important to do so before December 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Any amounts withdrawn from your TFSA in the current year will free up equivalent contribution room for the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Conversely, if you wait until January to withdraw, you will have to wait an additional year to regain that contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

### Example:
If you need $5,000 for an expense or large purchase, withdrawing it before December 31st ensures you can re-contribute that same $5,000 next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. Delaying this withdrawal could limit your ability to grow your investments tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>.

[[income_splitting_for_tax_savings | Income splitting]] can lead to significant tax savings, with some individuals saving over six figures in taxes through these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is described as a carefully choreographed dance between partners, where harmony is key to avoiding high taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Employer-Sponsored Pension Income Splitting

One effective [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategy]] involves employer-sponsored pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This strategy focuses on pension income from Defined Benefit Pension Plans (DBPP) and Defined Contribution Pension Plans (DCPP), not Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### How it Works
[[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | Pension income splitting]] allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This allocation helps reduce the overall household tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Eligibility Rules
Eligibility for [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | pension income splitting]] varies based on the type of pension income and the age of the individuals (under or over 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **Before Age 65**:
    *   Income from a Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP) qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals from a Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP) generally do not qualify, unless in specific circumstances like the death of a spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **After Age 65**:
    *   Both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution pension income are eligible for [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals from Registered Income Funds (RIFs) and Life Income Funds (LIFs) also become eligible, simplifying the balancing of taxable income for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider Ted and Robin, a retired couple in their 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
*   Ted has an annual pension income of $40,000, taxed at his marginal rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Robin has minimal income, placing her in a lower tax bracket of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

By using [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | pension income splitting]], Ted can shift some of his pension income to Robin, resulting in lower overall taxes for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

#### Effectiveness
*   **Without splitting**: Ted would pay $12,000 in taxes as his entire income is taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **With splitting**: By splitting 20% of the income with Robin, she is taxed at her lower 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This strategy results in a combined tax saving of $3,000 by reallocating income to the lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

It is important to note that this example simplifies the scenario by assuming individuals remain in their respective marginal tax rates even with [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_families_and_retirees | income splitting]], which typically requires careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Combining Strategies for Maximum Benefit

[[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] strategies can be combined for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. For instance, a couple could use an FHSA for tax deductions, implement [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | pension income splitting]] in retirement, and add [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | spousal RRSP contributions]] to create more tax-deferred savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. These strategies work together to lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals, such as saving for a home or planning a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

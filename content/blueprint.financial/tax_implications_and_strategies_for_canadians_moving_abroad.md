Canadians planning to leave the country permanently need to manage their finances carefully to avoid significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Moving abroad impacts various financial accounts and benefits, including the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and Old Age Security (OAS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This information is relevant for retirees seeking to escape cold winters and high costs, as well as digital nomads or remote workers looking to avoid high taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Key areas to consider include [[managing_canadian_income_tax_obligations_after_leaving_canada | tax implications]], potential loss of benefits, and strategic financial moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

When a Canadian becomes a permanent non-resident and moves abroad, their TFSA is subject to several changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### TFSA Status and Withdrawals
*   **Tax-Free Status**: Your TFSA maintains its tax-free status in Canada even if you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals**: Funds can still be withdrawn from your TFSA while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These withdrawals are added back to your contribution room, but you cannot use this room again until you regain Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Repatriation**: If you return to Canada and become a resident again, you can resume normal TFSA activities, including making contributions up to your available room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Restrictions and Penalties
*   **No New Contributions**: New contributions to your TFSA are not allowed while you are a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. However, your existing TFSA can remain open and continue to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Penalties**: Contributing to your TFSA as a non-resident can result in penalties of 1% per month on the contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For example, a $5,000 contribution could lead to a $50 monthly penalty, totaling $600 over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Contribution Room**: You do not accumulate new TFSA contribution room for any years you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Tax Implications Abroad
While the growth within the TFSA remains tax-free in Canada, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains from your TFSA according to its local tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. For instance, the U.S. does not recognize the TFSA, so the IRS will tax all income and gains from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It might be advisable to collapse the TFSA account before moving to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip for TFSA
> Max out your TFSA contribution before leaving Canada. This allows your investments to continue growing tax-free while you are abroad, and you cannot contribute more once you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP)

### Contributions and Withdrawals
*   **Contributions**: As a non-resident, you can still contribute to your RSP if you have available contribution room from Canadian-earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. However, without Canadian income, you won't generate new contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals**: Any withdrawals made as a non-resident are subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This rate can be lower if a tax treaty exists between Canada and your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Tax Implications Abroad
RSP investments continue to grow tax-deferred in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, your new country might tax the income and gains within your RSP, depending on their tax laws and any existing tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. For example, the U.S. generally does not tax the income and gains within your RSP due to the tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Canada has tax treaties with 91 countries, including the U.S., Mexico, Costa Rica, and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Management and RRIF Conversion
You can keep your RSP open and manage investments as a non-resident, but be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees if withdrawing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. As a non-resident, you can convert your RSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. RRIF withdrawals will have similar withholding tax rules (usually 25%), unless a tax treaty reduces it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Minimum withdrawals are based on your age and RRIF value, similar to being in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For instance, the Canada-U.S. tax treaty can reduce RSP withholding tax rates to 15% for periodic withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Repatriation
If you return to Canada, you can resume contributing to your RSP based on any new Canadian income you generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The CPP is based on contributions made during your working life in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Benefit Continuity
*   **Benefits Travel**: Your CPP benefits will travel with you if you move abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The amount received abroad remains the same as if you lived in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Family Benefits**: CPP survivor benefits and Child Benefits also continue to be paid even if the recipient lives abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Tax Implications Abroad
CPP payments may be subject to withholding taxes depending on the tax treaty status of your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For example, the Canada-U.S. tax treaty can reduce or eliminate the withholding tax on CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Without a tax treaty, you could face a 25% withholding tax on your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

Canada has social security agreements with over 50 countries to ensure CPP coverage continues uninterrupted and to avoid dual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. These agreements also coordinate pension benefits for those who have lived and worked abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Receiving Payments
CPP payments can be deposited into a local bank account in the local currency or into a Canadian bank account, which can then be transferred using a service like Wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Payments can also be mailed as checks in Canadian dollars, though this is less ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip for CPP
> If you are married or in a common-law relationship, consider [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | CPP splitting]] to potentially reduce your overall taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS)

OAS is based on the time you spent in Canada and can be collected as early as age 65, with the option to delay it up to age 70 for increased benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Eligibility Abroad
To receive OAS abroad, you must generally have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. You might still qualify if you worked abroad for a Canadian company or lived in a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. However, years spent in these countries do not count towards the OAS benefit amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### Benefits and Allowances
If you meet the requirements, the OAS benefit amount remains the same regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, additional OAS benefits, such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Survivor Allowance, require you to reside in Canada to receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Moving abroad will disqualify you from receiving GIS and other allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This impacts [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Canadian retirement benefits]].

### Tax Implications Abroad
High-income earners may face the OAS clawback (recovery tax) on earnings over a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This clawback still applies abroad unless you move to a country with a tax treaty with Canada that allows you to bypass it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Non-residents typically must file a T136 form annually to determine any required repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Countries without a tax treaty with Canada may impose a withholding tax on OAS payments, typically around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. For example, if you move to the U.S., there will be no withholding tax on your OAS due to the tax treaty between Canada and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Always check the specific tax treaty details for your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. To collect OAS abroad, you must file an annual tax return reporting your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

> [!TIP] Pro Tip for OAS
> If you are at risk of the OAS clawback, manage your income through strategic withdrawals from other retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Also, consider deferring OAS payments up to age 72 to increase your monthly benefit by 0.6% for each month deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Bonus Tip: What to Do With Your House

For those planning to move abroad, consider selling your home before you leave Canada to avoid significant taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Selling your principal residence after becoming a non-resident can result in a large capital gains tax, as Canada generally does not tax principal residences for residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Potential Tax Bill
> If you buy a home for $500,000 and its value appreciates to $800,000 before you move abroad, selling it after becoming a non-resident could incur capital gains tax on the $300,000 increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Depending on your residency status and tax treaties, this could lead to a significant tax bill, potentially upwards of $75,000 or more, which could have been avoided by selling before leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Consulting a Professional

It is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional to understand the specific details and implications for your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Ideally, seek advice from professionals in both Canada and the country you plan to move to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

For 2025, the Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for the Canada Pension Plan ([[details_on_canada_pension_plan_benefits | CPP]]), Old Age Security ([[old_age_security_pension_and_its_implications | OAS]]), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means recipients will receive payments for all three programs on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Payment Timing

Payment dates are typically set for the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. If a scheduled payment date falls on a weekend or a holiday, the payment will be issued slightly earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Receiving Methods

For enhanced convenience and reliability, it is recommended to set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Direct deposit ensures that funds are delivered to your account on time and is a safer alternative to waiting for a mailed check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

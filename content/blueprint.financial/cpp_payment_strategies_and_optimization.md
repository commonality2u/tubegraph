Many Canadians are receiving less than the maximum possible Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average Canadian receiving 40% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This article will explore the average and maximum CPP payouts at different ages, key factors determining benefits, and [[strategies to increase CPP payouts | strategies to help you get closer to the maximum amount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding CPP Payouts

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The payout varies significantly based on when you start receiving your pension.

### Average vs. Maximum Payouts (2024)

| Age to Start Pension | Average Monthly Amount | Maximum Monthly Amount |
| :------------------- | :--------------------- | :--------------------- |
| 60                   | $522 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>         | $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>         |
| 65 (Standard)        | $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>      | $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>     |
| 70                   | $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>      | $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>     |

At age 65, the average amount paid is 40.16% less than the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Key Factors Determining CPP Payouts

The main reasons for differences in CPP payouts are contributions and average earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Contributions**: CPP retirement pension benefits depend heavily on the amount and duration of contributions throughout your working life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to contribute for at least 39 years and ensure annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Average Earnings**: Your average earnings over your career directly affect the amount of CPP you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Consistently high annual earnings (at or above YMPE) maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, consequently, your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

#### Example: David and Sarah

David and Sarah are both 65 and receiving CPP with different payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

*   **David**: Started CPP at age 60 and receives an average of $816 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He had employment gaps and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. He also had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Sarah**: Started CPP at age 65 and receives the maximum payout of $1,364 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. She contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Sarah consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career, maximizing her CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The key takeaway is that having fewer contribution years and lower earnings results in an average amount, while a full contribution period and consistently higher earnings lead to maximized benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Essentially, the more you earn and contribute, the higher your CPP benefits will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## [[strategies_to_increase_cpp_payouts | Strategies to Increase CPP Payouts]]

Here are some ways to potentially move from average to maximum CPP payments:

1.  **Work While Receiving CPP**: If you continue working and contributing to CPP up to age 70, these additional contributions earn you a Post-Retirement Benefit, increasing your monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
2.  **Dropping Out Lower Income Years**: The CPP allows for various "drop-out" provisions to exclude periods of low or no earnings from your calculation, resulting in a higher average earnings calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   **General Drop-out Provision**: You can drop out up to 17% of your lowest income years from your calculation, which equals around 8 years if you've contributed for 47 years (age 18 to 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Child Rearing Drop-out**: If you took time off work to raise children under seven, these lower earning years can be excluded from your CPP calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   **Disability Provisions**: Periods of disability can adjust lower earning years to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
3.  **Maximize Earnings and Contributions Throughout Your Career**: Aim for your annual income to meet or exceed the YMPE ($68,500 for 2024, which will increase over time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher contributions translate into higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Start a Side Hustle**: Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs**: Aim for promotions and higher paying positions throughout your career; the more you earn, the more you contribute to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Longevity (Long Contribution Period)**: Ensure you've worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with higher earnings will yield higher benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Estimating CPP Benefits

To find out if you're on track for your desired CPP benefits, you can estimate your future payouts using several methods:

1.  **Rule of Thumb**: CPP has been enhanced to replace up to one-third of your earnings (up to the YMPE), an increase from the previous 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. While this is a helpful guideline (e.g., $40,000 annual earnings might yield $13,332 annually after enhancement vs. $10,000 before), it's a ballpark estimate best used for a quick gauge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
2.  **Using Calculators**:
    *   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator**: This is comprehensive and provides a detailed estimate of future CPP payments. It is thorough but can take about 30 minutes to complete and isn't the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Ativa's Calculator**: A quicker and easier-to-use option, though its accuracy may decrease the further you are from retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
3.  **Your Statement of Contributions**: This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Online**: Access it via your My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Once signed in, select "CPP OAS" and scroll to the contribution section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
    *   **By Phone**: You can call CPP directly to request your statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Delaying CPP Start Age**: While delaying your CPP start age (e.g., to 70) significantly increases your payout, it does not, by itself, boost you from the average payout to the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The other factors mentioned (contributions, earnings history) are what lead to the maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. [[optimal_timing_for_cpp_and_oas_benefits | Deciding when to start CPP]] is a separate and complex topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement Misconception**: Some believe starting CPP benefits at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. As a general rule, for most clients, it is better to [[strategies_to_delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | delay your CPP as long as possible]], even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

Optimizing your CPP payouts can lead to a more comfortable retirement.

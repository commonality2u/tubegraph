The used car market saw a significant surge, jumping 40% higher during the pandemic, but prices are now stabilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When considering your next car purchase, deciding whether to buy, lease, or finance can be complex, as there's no single best answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This article will guide you through the options, including the use of an online calculator and a breakdown of pros and cons, highlighting why buying a used car might be the best option today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## [[utilizing_online_calculators_for_car_purchase_decisions | Utilizing Online Calculators for Car Purchase Decisions]]

A helpful free online calculator for comparing car purchase options can be found at Bankrate.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This calculator is versatile and works for any car, regardless of whether you are in America or Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

To use the calculator effectively, you'll need to input several key numbers:
1.  **Vehicle Information**: Start by choosing the vehicle you intend to purchase or lease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The most accurate numbers will come from a dealership quote for both financing and leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If a quote isn't available, you can find information on the company's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For example, a Ford F-150, a popular vehicle in North America, might have a finance price of $49,995 for 48 months with a 1.99% APR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
2.  **General Inputs**:
    *   **Vehicle Price**: $49,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   **Down Payment**: Can be set to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Sales Tax Rate**: For instance, 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Investment Rate of Return (Opportunity Cost)**: This critical number represents the return you could earn if you invested your money elsewhere instead of using it for the car purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A higher investment rate makes buying a car a less attractive option compared to leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
        *   Conservative investor: 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
        *   Middle-of-the-road: 5-6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>
        *   Aggressive portfolio: 7% and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
        *   For the example, 5% was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Buy Option Inputs

For the buy option, you'll need:
*   **Term**: 48 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate (APR)**: 1.99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It's important to verify if you qualify for such low rates with the dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Fees**: For example, $2,495 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Depreciation Rate

The depreciation rate is arguably the most crucial factor in the calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Car depreciation is like an iceberg: the initial value loss is significant, especially in the first few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Methods to estimate car depreciation:
1.  **Average Depreciation Rates**: New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year and 15% each year for the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
2.  **Online Estimators**: Websites like Edmunds and Kelley Blue Book offer tools to estimate depreciation based on make, model, year, and mileage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
3.  **Current Marketplaces (Recommended)**: Checking sites like AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and Kijiji provides real-time insight into current values and how much a car has depreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This method is preferred as it shows actual listed and sold prices, not just estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

For the calculator example, an annual depreciation of 15% over 48 months was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Lease Option Inputs

For the lease option, you'll need:
*   **Term**: 48 months, to compare "apples to apples" with the buy option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Mileage/Kilometers**: Choose your expected annual usage (e.g., 20,000 or 25,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: For example, 4.49% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Other Fees**: For example, $2,495 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Residual Percent**: This is the car's expected value at the end of the lease term, typically between 40% and 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The dealership will provide this non-negotiable figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For the example, 50% was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Calculator Results and Sensitivity

After inputting these figures, the calculator will show the net cost of buying versus leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. In the example, the net cost to buy was $34,038, and to lease was $35,371, making it almost a toss-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

However, changing variables significantly impacts the outcome:
*   **Investment Rate of Return**: If your expected investment return is low (e.g., 3%), buying becomes more favorable ($32,000 vs. $35,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. If it's high (e.g., 10%), leasing becomes more financially advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Annual Depreciation**: This is the most unpredictable yet impactful factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   Low depreciation (e.g., 10%) for a reliable vehicle or low usage significantly decreases the net cost of buying ($27,000), making it much better than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    *   High depreciation (e.g., 25%) makes buying much more expensive ($44,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

The annual depreciation determines the actual market resale value of the car at the end of the term, which is hard to predict due to supply and demand fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Key Financial Takeaways

*   **High Resale Value**: If a vehicle maintains a high resale value, buying or financing is generally cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value**: If a vehicle is expected to have a low resale value, leasing becomes more cost-effective, especially if eligible for business write-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Cost**: When buying outright or making a large down payment, consider the opportunity cost of what that money could have earned if invested elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

These financial analyses are estimates, as future resale values and investment returns are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. For example, those who leased in 2017 missed out on profiting from soaring used car prices during the COVID-19 pandemic, where owning would have allowed capitalization on that market shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## [[nonfinancial_factors_when_choosing_to_lease_or_buy_a_car | Nonfinancial Factors When Choosing to Lease or Buy a Car]]

Since predicting the market is nearly impossible, non-financial factors can often outweigh purely financial considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

*   **Ownership Preference**:
    *   **Buy**: Ideal for long-term ownership and customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: Suitable if you prefer driving new models every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Tax Write-offs (for Business Owners)**:
    *   **Leasing**: Offers deductible payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
    *   **Buying**: Allows for depreciation and interest deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Choose based on your business's financial strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Debt Aversion**:
    *   **Leasing**: Means lower monthly payments without long-term debt, but no equity is built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. It may feel less burdensome if you want to avoid debt, though payments are generally higher than buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**:
    *   **Buying**: Offers the freedom to sell at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
    *   **Leasing**: Locks you into a term but may include conveniences like warranty coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Plans**:
    *   **Buy**: If you plan to keep the car for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: If you prefer frequent changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Environmental or Emotional Factors**:
    *   **Buying**: Generally supports sustainability more and fosters attachment to the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
    *   **Leasing**: Provides access to the latest eco-friendly models with higher turnover, which might feel less personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**:
    *   **Buying**: Means covering maintenance costs post-warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   **Leasing**: Often includes maintenance during the lease term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Insurance Costs**: Leased vehicles can potentially require higher insurance, increasing overall costs compared to buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **End-of-Lease Options**: Leasing offers the flexibility to buy the car at the end of the term, which can be beneficial if you're initially unsure about committing to a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Buying Used: Often the Smartest Financial Choice

Buying a used car is frequently the most financially sound decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. While leasing for tax benefits may be an option, buying new cars is generally not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. New cars can lose up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

The "sweet spot" for buying a car is when it's 3 to 5 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This strategy allows you to avoid the initial, significant depreciation hit and get more value for your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. At this age, cars are typically not old enough to have major issues yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Additionally, used cars usually come with lower insurance costs and less overall financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. With some research, you can find a reliable, well-priced used car that meets your needs, often with comparable or even better features than a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

Given the recent wild swings in the car market, making the right financial choice for your vehicle is more important than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

The traditional notion of retiring at 65, which was effective when housing costs were lower and life expectancies shorter, is no longer the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Today, Canadians may live 30 or more years in [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Without adequate [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | planning]], there's a risk of outliving one's savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Canadians are Retiring Later

A growing number of Canadians are working beyond age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The average retirement age has steadily increased:
*   **1997:** 60.9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>
*   **2010:** 62.5 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   **2020:** 64.3 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
*   **2024:** 65.3 years oldâ€”the highest in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

The median retirement age is now over 65, meaning more than half of retirees leave the workforce after 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   **12%** worked by choice to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **9%** worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Retirement ages also vary by sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:
*   **Public Sector:** Around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Private Sector:** Around 65.5 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed:** Nearly 69 years old on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Why Canadians Are Working Longer

Six primary reasons contribute to Canadians working longer and [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retiring later]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>:

### 1. Longer Lifespans
Canadians are living longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. If a person reaches 65 years old, they typically have about two or more decades ahead of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] is now a 20- to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and health management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### 2. Changing Pension Coverage
Defined benefit pensions, which offered a predictable income for life, are less common, especially in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Many are now covered by defined contribution plans, where [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement income]] depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Only 37.5% of paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning most Canadians must plan for [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement income]] through personal savings like [[financial_planning_with_taxfree_accounts_for_canadians | RRSPs]] and [[financial_planning_with_taxfree_accounts_for_canadians | TFSAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Retirees face surging costs without matching income boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   **Shelter Costs:** Up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Groceries:** Food prices have increased over 20% since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** While Canada has public healthcare, expenses like dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions often come out-of-pocket and rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
These rising costs make it harder to rely solely on [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]], [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | OAS]], and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Taxes]] can also significantly reduce available income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 4. Work Has Become Less Physical
Many jobs today are knowledge-based or service-oriented, involving less physical strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job is not physically demanding and a person remains mentally sharp, there's less incentive to stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Work can also provide structure, identity, and social connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
For boomers and Gen Xers, [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] is increasingly seen as freedom, not necessarily an escape from work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. It can involve part-time consulting, teaching, freelance work, or starting a passion project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | Retirement]] is often a gradual transition rather than a hard stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" (divorce among those over 50) is rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Late-life separations often necessitate a major financial reset, including asset division and potential new housing costs, which can delay [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] or require re-entering the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## The Impact of Uncertainty
Even with sufficient savings on paper, uncertainty can cause hesitation about [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation (even if improved) contribute to anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tension further compound this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Many Canadians delay [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] not out of necessity, but for peace of mind and a larger financial buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Retirement Planning Scenarios

Here's an example of how small changes in [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | financial planning]] can significantly impact [[retirement_income_challenges_in_canada | retirement outcomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, using a hypothetical individual, Keanu:

Keanu is 65, single, and aims for a modest lifestyle, spending $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. He previously earned $90,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. His assets include $400,000 in his [[financial_planning_with_taxfree_accounts_for_canadians | RRSP]] and $100,000 in his [[using_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, and his home is paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. He has no corporate pension, and [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | OAS]] are assumed to start at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Retiring Immediately at 65
If Keanu retires at 65 and immediately begins collecting [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | OAS]] while living off his savings, his money is projected to run out by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His [[financial_planning_with_taxfree_accounts_for_canadians | RRSP]] depletes quickly, and his [[using_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | TFSA]] cannot cover the remaining expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Working Three More Years
If Keanu works three more years, earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save, while still taking [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | OAS]] at age 65, his money easily lasts through age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He would also finish with a net estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This highlights that just three additional years of work can provide over a decade of financial security in [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Working Two More Years and Delaying CPP to 70 (Initial Attempt)
In this version, Keanu works for two more years but delays starting his [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]] until age 70 to lock in a higher monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Despite the higher [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]], he still faces a shortfall because he aggressively draws from his [[financial_planning_with_taxfree_accounts_for_canadians | RRSP]] between ages 67 and 69 to cover the gap, causing it to drain too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This shows that delaying [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]] is powerful, but requires a smart withdrawal strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP to 70, and Strategic RRSP Withdrawal
This strategic approach involves Keanu retiring at 67 and delaying [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | CPP]] to 70, but this time, he gradually draws from his [[financial_planning_with_taxfree_accounts_for_canadians | RRSP]] between ages 67 and 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. He draws just enough to cover his needs while keeping [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | taxes]] low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This strategy results in a steady income throughout [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]], a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate of over $500,000 remaining by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

This example illustrates that [[budgeting_for_retirement_in_canada | financial planning]] for [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement]] involves numerous factors, including [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | taxes]], [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | OAS]] clawbacks, withdrawal strategies, inflation, healthcare costs, and [[financial_strategies_for_canadian_retirees | estate planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The proper sequencing of payments and withdrawals can make a significant difference in achieving [[strategies_to_determine_your_retirement_number_in_canada | retirement goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

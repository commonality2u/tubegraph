Keeping non-Canadian dividend stocks within a [[TaxFree Savings Account TFSA changes when leaving Canada | TFSA]] can lead to a "silent wealth killer" due to foreign withholding taxes [00:09:25]. These taxes reduce investment returns and cannot be recovered within the [[TaxFree Savings Account TFSA changes when leaving Canada | TFSA]] [00:09:31].

## Foreign Withholding Tax

Non-Canadian dividends are subject to foreign withholding taxes [00:09:30]. For instance, US dividends typically incur a 15% withholding tax in a [[TaxFree Savings Account TFSA changes when leaving Canada | TFSA]] [00:09:37].

### Example of Impact
If an investor owns $10,000 of a US stock paying a 6% annual dividend, approximately $90 would be deducted at source in the US due to the 15% withholding tax [00:09:41]. Many individuals may not realize this deduction is occurring, making it a "truly silent wealth killer" [00:09:52].

*   Hold foreign dividend stocks in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), as RSPs do not have this withholding tax [00:10:04].

All-in-one ETFs, also known as asset allocation ETFs, simplify investing by bundling multiple ETFs into a single fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. They offer a straightforward way to achieve diversification without constant management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Key Advantages of All-in-One ETFs

### Instant Diversification
All-in-one ETFs provide immediate diversification across various asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This eliminates the need to select individual investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. For example, Vanguard's VGRO, a prominent all-in-one ETF in [[overview_of_allinone_etfs_in_canada | Canada]], offers exposure to over 13,000 companies worldwide through a blend of Canadian, US, International, and emerging market stocks (80% allocation) and a mix of Canadian and global bonds (20% allocation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This broad diversification helps to reduce risk and potentially enhance returns by spreading investments across different countries, industries, and asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Low Cost
A significant advantage of all-in-one ETFs is their low fee structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Unlike traditional mutual funds in Canada that often charge around a 2% Management Expense Ratio (MER), all-in-one ETFs typically range from 0.2% to 0.25% MER <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This lower fee significantly preserves your investment returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This aspect is further detailed in [[comparing_allinone_etfs_and_traditional_mutual_funds | Comparing All-in-One ETFs and Traditional Mutual Funds]].

### Automatic Rebalancing
All-in-one ETFs automatically rebalance their holdings to maintain the desired stock-to-bond ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This feature means you don't need to manually adjust your asset mix, as the ETF handles the buying and selling internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Suitability for Smaller Accounts
For those just starting with a [[TFSA investment strategies | TFSA]], RRSP, or other investment accounts, all-in-one ETFs provide instant diversification without requiring investments across multiple funds or stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. A single all-in-one ETF can provide exposure to thousands of stocks and bonds, making it ideal for investors with smaller starting capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Time-Saving and Simplicity
These ETFs offer a professionally managed portfolio, eliminating the need for extensive research and individual stock/bond purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The "set it and forget it" approach appeals to those seeking a low-maintenance investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Who Can Benefit?
All-in-one ETFs are particularly well-suited for several types of investors:
*   **Beginners:** They offer a simple, low-maintenance portfolio for those new to investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Busy Professionals:** Individuals with demanding careers who lack time for constant investment management can rely on all-in-one ETFs to keep their money growing in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Parents Investing for Children's Future:** For RESPs or other long-term savings for a child's education, these ETFs provide instant diversification and require minimal maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Small Account Investors:** As mentioned, they provide immediate diversification even with limited funds, especially for accounts like a [[benefits_of_the_tfsa | TFSA]] or RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Performance Example: VGRO
An investment of $10,000 into VGRO in January 2020 would have grown to approximately $16,000 by January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This demonstrates the potential of a globally diversified, low-cost portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Simplicity in Action
While [[common_mistakes_to_avoid_when_investing_in_allinone_etfs | common mistakes]] can occur, all-in-one ETFs are designed to be standalone investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Adding multiple funds can disrupt the carefully designed asset allocation and risk profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The key is to [[choosing_the_right_allinone_etf_based_on_risk_tolerance | choose one]] that aligns with your risk tolerance and investment goals, and then allow it to work for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

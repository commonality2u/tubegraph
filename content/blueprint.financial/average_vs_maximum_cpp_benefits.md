The majority of Canadians receive significantly less than the maximum possible Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payout, with the average Canadian receiving 40% less than the maximum [00:00:05]. Understanding the difference between average and maximum CPP benefits, and the [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | factors determining CPP payouts]], is crucial for optimizing your retirement income [00:00:17].

## Average and Maximum CPP Payouts (2024)

Not everyone receives the same amount of CPP, as payouts vary based on the age at which you begin receiving your pension [00:00:37].

| Age to Start Pension | Average Monthly Amount (April 2024) | Maximum Monthly Amount (2024) |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| **60**               | $522.00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>        | $873.00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>        |
| **65**               | $816.52 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>        | $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>       |
| **70**               | $1,159.00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>       | $1,937.00 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>       |

For a new retirement pension started at the standard age of 65 in April 2024, the average amount was $816.52, which is 40.16% less than the maximum of $1,364.60 [00:00:57].

## [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | Factors Determining CPP Payouts]]

The primary reasons for the difference in CPP payouts between individuals are related to their contribution history [00:02:01].

### Contributions
Your CPP retirement pension benefits are heavily dependent on the amount and duration of your contributions throughout your working life [00:02:07]. Both employees and employers contribute based on earnings up to the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) [00:02:16]. For 2024, the YMPE is $68,500 [00:02:22].

To receive the maximum benefit, you generally need to:
*   Contribute for at least 39 years [00:02:32].
*   Ensure your annual earnings meet or exceed the YMPE each year [00:02:36].
*   The more and longer you contribute, the higher your pension will be [00:02:44].

### Average Earnings
Your average earnings over your career directly affect your CPP contributions and, consequently, the amount you receive [00:02:50]. CPP payments are calculated based on your best 40 years of earnings [00:02:59]. Higher average earnings lead to higher CPP benefits [00:03:03]. Consistently earning at or above the YMPE will maximize your CPP benefits [00:03:08].

It's important to be mindful of gaps in earnings, as years with lower or no earnings can reduce your average earnings and, therefore, your CPP benefits [00:03:17].

### Real-Life Example: David and Sarah
David and Sarah, both 65, receive different CPP payouts due to their contribution histories [00:01:37].
*   **Sarah:**
    *   Contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with a very long contribution period [00:03:31].
    *   Consistently earned at or above the YMPE throughout her career, maximizing her contributions [00:03:49].
    *   Result: Sarah maxed out her CPP benefits, receiving $1,364 per month at age 65 [00:04:30].
*   **David:**
    *   Had gaps in employment and started contributing later, resulting in fewer years of contribution [00:03:39].
    *   Had many years of much lower earnings, which reduced overall contributions [00:03:55].
    *   Result: David received only the average amount of $816 per month at age 65 [00:04:19].

In essence, the more you earn and contribute to CPP, the higher your eventual benefits will be [00:04:45].

## [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | Strategies to Maximize CPP Benefits]]

You can potentially move from average to maximum CPP payments by implementing certain [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | strategies to maximize CPP benefits]]:

### 1. Work While Receiving CPP
If you continue working and contributing to CPP up to age 70, these additional contributions can earn you a post-retirement benefit [00:05:04]. This benefit directly increases your monthly income [00:05:16]. For example, Sarah, at 67, still works part-time, and her continued contributions are boosting her monthly CPP payouts [00:05:18].

### 2. Drop Out Lower Income Years
The CPP includes provisions to exclude certain lower or no-income years from your benefit calculation, which can increase your average earnings [00:05:32].
*   **General Drop-out Provision:** Allows you to drop up to 17% of your lowest income years from the calculation. For someone who contributed for 47 years (age 18 to 65), this equals about 8 years [00:05:36].
*   **Child Rearing Drop-out:** If you took time off work to raise children under the age of seven, you can exclude these lower earning years [00:06:01].
*   **Disability Provisions:** Periods of disability can also be adjusted to your advantage, boosting your CPP pension [00:06:14].

### 3. Max Out Your Earnings and Contributions
Consistently aiming to have your annual income meet or exceed the YMPE ($68,500 for 2024) will result in higher contributions and, thus, higher benefits [00:06:25].

Consider these suggestions:
*   **Start a Side Hustle:** Increasing your income through a side hustle can help you meet or exceed the YMPE, boosting your CPP contributions [00:06:48]. Alex, for instance, started a successful online business that helped him exceed the YMPE [00:07:02].
*   **Seek Higher Paying Jobs:** Aim for promotions and positions that offer higher salaries. More earnings translate to higher CPP contributions and future benefits [00:07:15].
*   **Longevity of Contributions:** Ensure you have worked and contributed to CPP for at least 39 years with consistent high earnings [00:07:24]. Your CPP is based on your best 40 years of earnings, so a longer contribution period with high earnings leads to higher benefits [00:07:32].

## [[how_to_estimate_your_cpp_benefits | How to Estimate Your CPP Benefits]]

To determine if you are on track for your target CPP benefits, you can use several estimation methods:

### 1. Rule of Thumb
The CPP has been enhanced to provide bigger payouts [00:07:54]. Previously, it replaced 25% of average work earnings, but with enhancements, it can now replace up to one-third of your earnings up to the YMPE [00:08:03]. For example, if your average annual earnings were $40,000, under the old rule, CPP would replace about $10,000 annually. With the enhancement, it replaces about $13,332 annually [00:08:10]. This method is a ballpark estimate due to [[maximum_limits_and_how_personal_cpp_benefits_affect_survivorship_pension | maximum limitations]] and the complexity of calculating for every working year [00:08:28].

### 2. Using Calculators
For a more tailored estimate, online calculators are available:
*   **Government of Canada Retirement Income Calculator:** Comprehensive and provides detailed estimates, but can take about 30 minutes to complete and may not be the most user-friendly [00:08:51].
*   **Ativa's Calculator:** A quicker and easier option, though its accuracy decreases the further you are from retirement [00:09:10].

### 3. Your Statement of Contributions
This statement provides an estimate of your monthly CPP benefits at different retirement ages (60, 65, and 70) [00:09:22].
*   **Online:** Access via your My Service Canada account. Log in, select "CPP OAS," and navigate to the contribution section to view your history and estimated benefits [00:09:39].
*   **By Phone:** You can also call CPP directly to request your statement [00:09:59].

## Important Distinctions Regarding CPP Timing

While delaying your CPP start age does significantly increase your payout, it's crucial to understand that it does not automatically boost you from an average payout to a maximum payout [00:10:10]. The other [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | factors affecting CPP payouts]] mentioned previously are what influence your potential to reach the maximum [00:10:22].

Deciding when to start CPP is a separate, complex topic covered in depth in other resources, particularly concerning [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | Timing of CPP Benefits]] [00:10:26].

A common misconception is that starting CPP benefits early at age 60 helps avoid penalties for having no income between 60 and 65 [00:10:36]. In reality, the reduction for starting CPP early is much more significant than the impact of a few zero or low-income years [00:10:48]. For most individuals, it is generally better to delay your CPP as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 [00:10:56].

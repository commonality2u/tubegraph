After researching, he considers Spain, Portugal, and New Zealand due to their great health care, lower cost than Canada, and solid safety records. Conversely, he avoids Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico due to inconsistent health care, varying living costs, and safety concerns." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>

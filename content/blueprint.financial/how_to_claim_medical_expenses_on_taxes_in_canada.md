In Canada, while healthcare is often considered "free," out-of-pocket medical expenses can still be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to claim some of these costs on their taxes to help offset the burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide outlines how to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible medical expenses]] and strategies to [[maximizing_tax_refunds_from_medical_expenses|maximize your tax refund]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work in Canada

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) enables Canadians to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses]] on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Where to Claim Expenses
Medical expenses are entered on specific lines of your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>:
*   **Line 33099:** For expenses incurred by yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Line 33199:** For expenses for other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Calculation of Eligible Claim
You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. From your total [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible medical expenses]], you must subtract the *lower* of:
*   3% of your net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   $2,759 (for 2024 expenses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

This remaining amount is claimed as a non-refundable tax credit, which reduces your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

> [!Example] Jessica's Claim
> Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
> *   3% of her income: $50,000 * 0.03 = $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
> *   The lower of $1,500 and $2,759 (2024 threshold) is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
> *   Eligible claim: $2,500 (total expenses) - $1,500 (threshold) = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
> Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Common Medical Expenses You Can Claim

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications
The CRA allows you to claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible prescription drugs and medications]] as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Eligibility:** Must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Included:** Some over-the-counter medications (vitamins, supplements) and medical marijuana are covered under specific conditions (valid medical document, purchased from licensed producer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!Example] Sarah's Medication Claim
> Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
> *   3% of her income: $60,000 * 0.03 = $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
> *   Eligible claim: $3,000 - $1,800 = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
> Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Keep Records
> Always keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to [[maximizing_tax_refunds_from_medical_expenses|maximize your claim]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care
Many dental and vision expenses are tax deductible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Eligibility:** Services provided by licensed professionals like dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Covered Expenses:** Routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces, and prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Not Covered:** Purely cosmetic procedures (e.g., teeth whitening) and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> [!Example] Alex's Dental and Vision Claim
> Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
> *   3% of his income: $150,000 * 0.03 = $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
> *   The lower of $4,500 and the 2024 threshold of $2,759 is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
> *   Eligible claim: $3,100 - $2,759 = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
> Alex can claim $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Timing Major Procedures
> Higher-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures (e.g., laser eye surgery and a root canal) within the same 12-month period to [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada|maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Medical Travel Expenses
If you must travel for medical care, you may be able to claim your travel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Distance:** Applies if you travel at least 40 km one way for services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Over 80 km:** If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Eligible Costs:** Public transportation (bus, train, taxi, flights), vehicle expenses (fuel, parking, maintenance), lodging (hotel, Airbnb), and meals (for extended stays) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

> [!Example] Jennifer's Travel Claim
> Jennifer earns $55,000 and travels 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over 3 months, spending $800 on gas and parking and $1,500 on meals and accommodations for a total of $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
> *   3% of her income: $55,000 * 0.03 = $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
> *   Eligible claim: $2,300 - $1,650 = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
> Jennifer can claim $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Accompanied Person & Records
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanied person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Private Health Insurance Premiums
Premiums paid out-of-pocket for private health insurance may be deductible from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Eligibility:** Includes plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Not Covered:** Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed:** Premiums for self-employed individuals can be claimed if they cover [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible expenses]] and are not reimbursed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Family Plans:** Family plans may allow claiming premiums for a spouse and children, which can help [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada|maximize deductions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> [!Example] Mark's Insurance Claim
> Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for private health insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
> *   3% of his income: $90,000 * 0.03 = $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
> *   Eligible claim: $3,500 - $2,700 = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
> Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Check Eligible Portions
> If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, check which portion of your premiums is [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible]] and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment
Many medical devices and equipment qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Wheelchairs, hearing aids, insulin pumps, CPAP machines, prosthetics, orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Home Modifications:** In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Requirements:** Some devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify; keep records of both the prescription and the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Maintenance:** Ongoing maintenance costs, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> [!Example] Emily's CPAP Machine Claim
> Emily earns $65,000 and purchased a CPAP machine for $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
> *   3% of her income: $65,000 * 0.03 = $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
> *   Eligible claim: $2,500 - $1,950 = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
> Emily can claim $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Verify Eligibility
> If making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it's on the CRA's list of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions|eligible medical devices]] to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

If you have a family, properly claiming medical expenses can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

> [!Example] Richard and Pauline's Family Claim
> Richard and Pauline have two children, Jen (16) and Rob (19), with the following medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>:
> *   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
> *   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
> *   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
> *   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
> Total expenses: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses are combined with Richard's and Pauline's, totaling $6,300 for Line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Rob's expenses must be claimed separately on Line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

To determine who should claim the $6,300, they compare their eligible claims:
*   **Pauline:** Earns $55,000. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Richard:** Earns $42,000. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Since Richard can get a higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

> [!Pro Tip] Lowest Income Earner
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. By organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim, you can [[maximizing_tax_refunds_from_medical_expenses|maximize tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

[[capital_gains_tax_changes | Big tax updates]] in 2025 are significantly reshaping how [[Tax changes affecting business owners | business owners]] can plan and invest in Canada. These changes are crucial for minimizing taxes, protecting cash flow, and retaining more funds for business investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article outlines key [[future_scenarios_for_canada_capital_gains_tax | changes impacting businesses]] in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Capital Gains Tax for Corporations

The year 2025 marks Canada's first full year with a new [[capital_gains_tax_changes | capital gains tax]] structure specifically for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Inclusion Rate Increase

The capital gains inclusion rate for corporations is increasing from 50% to 66.67% (or 2/3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This means a larger portion of a corporation's capital gains will be subject to taxation, affecting after-tax profits, investment decisions, and financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

#### Example Calculation

Consider ABC Corp, a Canadian corporation that sells an investment property for a capital gain of $200,000 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

*   **Under Old Rules (50% Inclusion)**:
    *   $100,000 (50% of $200,000) would have been included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   At a hypothetical 10% corporate tax rate, the total tax owed would be $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Under 2025 Rules (66.67% Inclusion)**:
    *   Approximately $133,000 (2/3 or 66.67% of $200,000) is included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   At the same 10% corporate tax rate, the tax owed increases to approximately $13,334 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

This results in an extra tax liability of $3,334 compared to the old rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This represents a significant increase in tax liabilities, particularly for businesses that rely on capital gains from investments in real estate, securities, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Exemption for Sole Proprietors and Self-Employed Individuals

It's important to note that these [[capital_gains_tax_changes | changes]] **do not affect sole proprietors and self-employed individuals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. They will continue to be taxed at the regular 50% inclusion rate for capital gains. These adjustments are strictly for corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Planning Strategies Amidst Changes

[[Strategies for investors and business owners amidst tax changes | Careful planning is essential]] to mitigate the impact of the new inclusion rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Reassessing Investment Portfolios

Businesses that invest in high-growth assets or stocks generating large capital gains will face significantly higher taxes under the new rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A simpler option could involve switching to Canadian stocks that pay dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Dividends often come with tax advantages, such as the ability to recover some of that tax when dividends are paid out through mechanisms like Refundable Dividend Tax On Hand (RDTOH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

For instance, if a business earns $50,000 from high-growth stocks, two-thirds would be taxable under the new rules. Switching to a dividend-paying Canadian stock could allow for more tax recovery via RDTOH <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Contributing to an Individual Pension Plan (IPP)

Individual Pension Plans (IPPs) offer a tax-efficient retirement planning tool for [[Tax changes affecting business owners | business owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Contributions to an IPP are deductible from corporate income, which can help offset taxable gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This strategy not only reduces immediate tax liabilities but also builds a solid retirement fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. IPPs are similar to an RRSP for a corporation but offer higher limits and greater flexibility for succession planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

These [[advanced_tax_strategies_for_small_businesses_in_canada | advanced tax strategies]] require careful planning and analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)

For some positive news, the [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase_in_2025 | Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)]] limit has increased to $1.25 million in 2025, up from approximately $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This exemption allows individuals to shield a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

For example, if a qualified small business is sold for $1.25 million in 2025, the entire capital gain could potentially be exempt from individual tax, depending on the individual's remaining LCGE limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Multiple Shareholders

The LCGE is available to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If multiple shareholders sell their shares, each can claim the exemption on their portion of the gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This [[reducing_taxes_on_investments_in_canada | strategy]] can significantly reduce the overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI)

The Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI) provides tax relief for [[Tax changes affecting business owners | business owners]] by reducing the [[incremental_taxation_in_canada | capital gains inclusion rate]] to 1/3 or 33.33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This applies to a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The incentive is being phased in gradually, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching the full $2 million cap by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Example

A small business owner with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would only include $33,600 in taxable income under the CEI, compared to $66,500 without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

While the CEI reduces the inclusion rate, it does not address investment income taxation, which remains subject to regular corporate tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. For many [[Tax changes affecting business owners | business owners]], the LCGE often remains a more effective tool because it offers a complete exemption for eligible capital gains, especially when multiple shareholders are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. By strategically allocating gains across shareholders, businesses can maximize the benefits of the LCGE and reduce tax liabilities without relying solely on the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This is a nuanced area of tax planning, and combining strategies like the CEI and LCGE can be very powerful if implemented correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

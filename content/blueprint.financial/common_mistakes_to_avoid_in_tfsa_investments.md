To successfully reach a $1 million TFSA, it's crucial to understand and avoid common pitfalls that can hinder your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Two significant mistakes often prevent individuals from achieving their TFSA goals.

## Mistake 1: Investing in Only a Savings Account

One major mistake is investing only in a savings account within your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While seemingly safe, this approach offers very low returns and dramatically extends the time it takes to reach significant wealth.

Consider this example: if you start with $95,000 in your TFSA, contribute $7,000 annually, and earn a low interest rate of 2%, it would take a remarkable 56 years to reach $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. By that point, you would have contributed a total of $487,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If you begin this strategy at age 25, you would be 81 years old before hitting the million-dollar mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
> A recent survey indicated that 47% of Canadian TFSA holders have only cash and savings in their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This suggests that many Canadians might never reach a million-dollar goal, even if they consistently maximize their TFSA contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Mistake 2: Taking on Excessive Risk

On the opposite end of the spectrum, another common mistake is taking on way too much [[investment_risk_management_in_tfsa_accounts | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This often involves betting on very high-risk assets, such as speculative crypto coins.

While a high-risk investor with $95,000 might hypothetically double their money annually (100% return), reaching $1 million in just 3 to 4 years with only $120,000 invested, this is an extremely rare and unsustainable scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The vast majority of individuals attempting a high-risk, high-reward strategy will not achieve such generous returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In fact, the chances of losing all your money are extremely high, rendering the entire strategy worthless if your investment goes to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
> Warren Buffett's famous quote, "Rule number one: Never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one," underscores the importance of avoiding losses over seeking spectacular gains in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

These two extremes highlight the need for a balanced approach to [[optimal_uses_and_misuse_of_a_tfsa | TFSA investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Finding a middle ground that balances risk and return, suited to your personal [[investment_risk_management_in_tfsa_accounts | risk tolerance]], is key to reaching a million-dollar TFSA in a sustainable and reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Filing taxes late can result in significant financial repercussions and delays in receiving benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is crucial to meet the April 30th deadline to avoid unnecessary costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Financial Penalties

If you owe taxes and file late, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) imposes penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>:
*   A 5% penalty on the unpaid balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   An additional 1% penalty per month until the balance is paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Repeated late filing can lead to increased penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

Most Canadians do not receive the maximum possible Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefit, which is around $2,000 per month, even after decades of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The average payment for those starting at age 60 is significantly lower, at about $530 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Three major [[Factors Affecting Maximum CPP Benefits | factors affecting your CPP payout]] are your salary, when you start collecting benefits, and your contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Why Earning a High Salary Doesn't Guarantee a Max CPP

To receive the maximum CPP payout, your salary and income must meet the maximum contribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, what constitutes a "maximum" has changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

With CPP2, introduced in 2024, a second earning ceiling (Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings, or YMP) was added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. In 2024, the YMP is $81,300, meaning you need to earn this amount annually to qualify for maximum CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The maximum threshold has consistently increased, making it more challenging to reach maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example:
*   In 1990, $28,900 was sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   In 2000, it was $37,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   In 2010, it was $47,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

This trend means younger Canadians will need even higher salaries to qualify for the maximum benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Consider James, who earned at least the maximum YMP for nearly four decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Despite this, when he started collecting CPP at age 60, he received only about $917 per month, less than half of the full $2,034 maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This illustrates that even high-income earners may not get the maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Delaying CPP: Why Timing Matters

One of the most significant [[Factors affecting CPP timing decision | factors affecting your CPP payout]] is when you start collecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The longer you wait, the higher your monthly payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Here's how CPP payments change based on when you start:
*   **Age 60**: Average monthly payment is $540, with a maximum of $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Starting at 60 reduces your payments by around 36% for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Age 65**: Average payment jumps to $888, with a maximum of $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Age 70**: Delaying until 70 boosts your pay by 42% compared to taking it at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Despite the substantial [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp | financial benefits of waiting]], less than 2% of Canadians delay CPP until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The vast majority of Canadians will not receive the maximum amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

CPP payments are indexed to inflation, meaning they will increase over time to keep up with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

> **Pro Tip**: Consider [[maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delaying Old Age Security (OAS)]] alongside CPP. OAS also increases by 0.6% per month after age 65, which can significantly boost your retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Delaying CPP is not suitable for everyone; [[impact_of_health_on_cpp_decision | factors such as your life expectancy]], financial situation, and income needs should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

Even with a high salary and delaying CPP to age 70, the maximum payout is not guaranteed. For example, Jerry and Elaine were both high-income earners who contributed the maximum to CPP and decided to delay benefits until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Elaine received the full $2,034 per month, but Jerry received less than $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This brings us to the third major factor.

## Contribution Gaps: Why Even High Earners Can Fall Short

CPP is based on your lifetime contributions, not just your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. To get the maximum CPP payout, you generally need to have at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Many people fall short due to gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Common reasons for contribution gaps include:
*   **Career Breaks**: Taking time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While the child-rearing provision can help, some gaps may remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment or Business Ownership**: Inconsistent or lower CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Unemployment**: Years of unemployment can drag down your lifetime average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry**: Not having the full 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Elaine received the full amount because she had 39 years of maximum contributions with no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Jerry, despite delaying CPP to 70, had significant contribution gaps (e.g., time off for a business, school, or unemployment), which pulled his average down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### How Contribution Gaps Affect Your Final CPP Pay

CPP calculates your retirement benefit using your best 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The General Dropout Provision allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest-earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Since CPP considers 47 years of potential contributions from ages 18 to 65, this means you can drop approximately 8 years of low or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you delay CPP to 70, your working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains about 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

This provision helps reduce the impact of short gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. However, if you miss more than 8 years of contributions, your final payout will be lower, even if you earned a high salary and delayed CPP to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This was Jerry's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Think of CPP as a three-legged stool: your payout depends on **salary**, **timing**, and **consistency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. If one leg is weak, the whole structure becomes unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## How to Maximize Your CPP Based on These Three Key Factors

To get the maximum CPP payout, you need to optimize all three factors:

1.  ### [[Strategies to increase CPP benefits | Delay CPP]] until as late as possible (preferably age 70)
    This is often the easiest way to increase your payout, as it doesn't require earning more or changing your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   Delaying past age 65: Your CPP increases by 8.4% per year, up to a 42% boost at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
    *   Starting before age 65: Your CPP decreases by 7.2% per year, up to a 36% reduction at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to plan for other income sources (e.g., investments, TFSAs, RRSPs) to cover expenses while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

2.  ### Earn at least the YMP (or higher) for as many years as possible
    This is the most challenging factor as it requires increasing your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Negotiate higher wages and promotions: The more you earn, the more you can contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
    *   Start a side hustle or business: Ensure you pay into CPP if self-employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   Level up your skills: Invest in certifications, training, or new skills for higher-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   Switch jobs strategically: Changing employers can often lead to faster salary growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

3.  ### Avoid contribution gaps and maximize your contribution years
    Even with delayed CPP and a high salary, too many missing years will prevent you from getting the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   Aim to work for at least 39 years with strong contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   CPP allows you to drop up to 8 years of lower or no contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>; missing more will lower your payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   Utilize the child-rearing provision to exclude low-income years if you took time off to raise children under seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Maximizing your CPP is about making smart decisions and strategies that can result in hundreds more dollars per month in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

While [[comparing_rrsps_with_ipps_and_family_trusts | RRSPs]] are a personal tax-sheltered retirement savings tool, a [[advanced_taxsaving_strategies_with_family_trusts_and_ipps | Family Trust]] offers greater flexibility in managing wealth, reducing taxes, and planning for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. It's a powerful tool for building and preserving wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## What is a Family Trust?
A [[advanced_taxsaving_strategies_with_family_trusts_and_ipps | Family Trust]] can allow income to be distributed among family members in lower tax brackets, which helps to minimize overall tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Unlike an [[comparing_rrsps_with_ipps_and_family_trusts | RSP]], which has strict contribution limits and taxable withdrawals upon retirement, a [[advanced_taxsaving_strategies_with_family_is_and_ipps | Family Trust]] has no contribution caps and offers more control over how and when money is distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

A [[advanced_taxsaving_strategies_with_family_trusts_and_ipps | Family Trust]] can hold a variety of assets, including [[private_equity_strategies_for_wealthy_canadians | private equity]], businesses, real estate, and other investments, making it a powerful tool for long-term financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Two Canadians have reportedly grown their Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) to over $40 million, paying zero taxes on the gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This extraordinary feat is considered "near impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> and highlights these individuals as "outliers" or "unicorns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, given the TFSA's relatively short existence of about 16 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While the exact methods of these anonymous investors are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, one theoretical approach to achieve such massive growth is through aggressive options trading.

## Options Trading: The Ultra-Risky Strategy

Options trading is an "ultra risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> method that, combined with perfect timing and luck, could theoretically turn a small TFSA into a multi-million dollar portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### How it Works (Hypothetical Scenario)

Imagine starting in 2015 with $10,000 in your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:
*   **Tesla (2015)**: Investing $10,000 into volatile Tesla call options, expecting a jump. If the options 10x, your $10,000 becomes $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Nvidia (early)**: Rolling the $100,000 into Nvidia call options before the major AI boom, when the stock was under $50. A few months later, another huge run could turn $100,000 into $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Shopify (pre-COVID)**: Betting big on Shopify just before the e-commerce surge during COVID-19. This could escalate $500,000 to $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Further Bets**: Two more "huge lucky bets," perhaps on GameStop during the meme stock frenzy or another Nvidia run in 2023, with a 5x and then a 3x return, could bring the TFSA to over $35 million tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### What are Options?
Options are contracts that grant the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a stock at a predetermined price in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They are inexpensive compared to buying the actual stock but are highly sensitive to price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, an option might jump from $2 to $10 in days, representing a 5x return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. However, if the stock drops or doesn't move quickly enough, the option can instantly become worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This makes options trading "investing on steroids," where small wins can become massive, but a single mistake can lead to a complete crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Risks and Challenges

Using options trading to grow a TFSA to millions is fraught with significant risks:

#### 1. CRA Risk
The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) monitors TFSA activity. If an account displays "business-like activity," such as frequent trades, short holding periods, or high volume, the CRA can audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. If they determine the account is operating like a business, all tax-free gains become fully taxable income, potentially resulting in a 50% tax bill plus penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The CRA does not provide clear guidelines on what constitutes "too much" activity, keeping the rules vague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

#### 2. Extreme Financial Risk
Options and other speculative plays carry the risk of wiping out an entire TFSA in an instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. One wrong move can turn $10,000 into zero, and in some cases, even result in owing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This strategy is akin to "trying to jump across a canyon" â€“ success is incredible, but failure leaves no second chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

#### 3. Flawless Timing, Discipline, and Luck
Achieving such results requires:
*   **Expert-level options knowledge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Perfectly timing the market multiple times** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Staying under the CRA's radar** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Extreme luck**, bordering on requiring insider-level insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

#### 4. Emotional Pressure
The psychological toll of managing such volatile investments is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Investors must navigate gut-wrenching volatility, endure positions dropping by 60%, avoid illiquid trades, resist the pressure to cash out early, and overcome the temptation to make "just one more trade" that could lead to losing everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Most people would likely "tap out long before reaching seven figures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

## Conclusion

While it is technically possible to turn a TFSA into tens of millions using options trading, it's considered highly improbable, akin to "walking into a casino with $1,000 and doubling it 16 times in a row to walk out with $60 million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. For every individual who might achieve such a feat, thousands have attempted similar strategies and ended up with an empty TFSA, a flagged account, or a substantial tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. It is generally not advisable to build a financial future on a "one-in-a-million shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Instead, the TFSA is a powerful tool for [[using_tfsa_as_a_part_of_retirement_and_wealthbuilding_strategy | wealthbuilding]] and [[maximizing_the_benefits_of_your_tfsa | tax savings]] when used strategically and wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

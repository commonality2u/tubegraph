Upon retirement, individuals may be eligible for Old Age Security (OAS) payments from the government, which can amount to up to $948 annually per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, these payments can be significantly reduced or "clawed back" if an individual's income exceeds certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This reduction is formally known as the recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Understanding the OAS Clawback (Recovery Tax)

The OAS clawback activates when an individual's income surpasses a specific threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is set at $9,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. If income reaches or exceeds $153,700 annually, the entire OAS benefit can be clawed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For those aged 75 and over, the maximum annual OAS benefit is $9,481 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The clawback applies a 15% recovery tax on the amount of income over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

For example, if a 75-year-old individual's income is $160,000 in 2024, exceeding the threshold of $9,995, the recovery tax on the excess income amounts to $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Since this amount is greater than the annual OAS benefit of $9,481, the individual would lose all of their OAS benefits for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the OAS Clawback

There are several strategies to mitigate or eliminate the OAS clawback, potentially saving retirees over $9,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. These [[strategies_for_financial_planning_in_retirement | strategies for financial planning in retirement]] range in complexity:

### 1. Delaying CPP Payments

Delaying Canada Pension Plan (CPP) payments until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70, can be an effective way to reduce the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This approach offers dual benefits:
*   **Increased Payments**: CPP payments can increase by up to 42% by delaying until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For instance, a $1,000 monthly CPP payment at age 65 would rise to $1,420 per month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These higher payments are also indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Lower Taxable Income**: Delaying CPP helps lower taxable income between ages 65 and 70, periods when the OAS clawback frequently occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

For example, an individual experiencing an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income from CPP and other retirement sources could reduce their clawback to $584 by delaying CPP, representing a savings of over $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### 2. Delaying OAS Payments

Similar to CPP, delaying OAS payments until age 70 can be a smart strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This action increases monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. A $500 monthly OAS payment at age 65 would become $680 per month at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This strategy can reduce or even eliminate the clawback during earlier retirement years when income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

In a scenario where an individual faces an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income, delaying OAS until age 70 could eliminate the entire clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This approach allows the individual to receive a higher monthly OAS payment after age 70 while avoiding benefit reductions in earlier years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

**Note**: Delaying CPP and OAS might not be beneficial for everyone, particularly if there are health issues or a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Personal circumstances and [[retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement planning strategies in Canada]] should guide these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### 3. Using Your TFSA Wisely

The Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a powerful tool for avoiding the OAS clawback because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This means funds can be accessed for living expenses without increasing taxable income, helping individuals stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

For example, withdrawing $20,000 per year from a $100,000 TFSA for living expenses would not incur any taxes or count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This contrasts with withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like an RRSP, which could push income over the threshold and trigger the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

A pro tip is to use the [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP withdrawal strategies for retirement]] by gradually withdrawing from an RRSP and contributing to a TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This strategy, sometimes called an "RRSP-TFSA ladder", keeps taxable income lower later in life and allows for tax-free withdrawals from the TFSA in retirement, minimizing the OAS clawback effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting

[[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | Pension income splitting]] can significantly reduce a couple's overall taxable income and help avoid the OAS clawback, especially when one spouse earns substantially less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This strategy permits transferring up to 50% of eligible pension income to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

For instance, if one spouse earns $60,000 annually from a pension and the other earns less, $30,000 of the pension income can be transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This reduces the higher-earning spouse's taxable income to $30,000, potentially putting them in a lower tax bracket and reducing the risk of triggering the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. The couple pays less tax overall, and the higher-earning spouse's income stays below the OAS clawback threshold of $9,997, preserving their full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### 5. Managing RRIF Withdrawals

When an RRSP converts to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) at age 71, minimum annual withdrawals become mandatory and are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These withdrawals can push income over the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. However, [[rrif_withdrawal_strategies_to_minimize_taxes | RRIF withdrawal strategies to minimize taxes]] exist:

*   **Using a Younger Spouse's Age**: If one spouse is younger, the RRIF holder can base the minimum withdrawal rate on the younger spouse's age, resulting in a lower required withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For example, at age 71, a 5.28% withdrawal rate is typical. If the spouse is 65, the rate drops to 4%, meaning a $200,000 RRIF would require withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering taxable income by $2,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Tapping Non-Taxable Accounts First**: Prioritizing withdrawals from non-taxable accounts like a TFSA can help manage taxable income before drawing heavily from RRIFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

More details on this strategy can be found in discussions regarding [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | RRSP withdrawal planning in retirement]].

### 6. Strategic Investing in Non-Registered Accounts

The type of income generated from non-registered accounts can significantly impact taxable income and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>:
*   **Interest Income**: Fully taxable at the marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Dividend Income**: Taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains**: Only 50% are taxed at the marginal rate if under the $250,000 threshold, making them a more tax-efficient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, individuals can reduce their taxable income and stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. For instance, $10,000 in capital gains would result in only $5,000 being taxable, compared to $10,000 in fully taxable interest income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### 7. Capturing Capital Gains Before Age 65

Timing the realization of capital gains is crucial for OAS clawback avoidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. By selling assets for a profit and "capturing" these gains before turning 65, individuals can avoid large taxable events once OAS payments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Although capital gains are taxed favorably (50% inclusion rate), large gains can still push income over the clawback threshold during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

A smart approach is to realize significant capital gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This allows taxes to be paid earlier, preventing an increase in taxable income during crucial OAS years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. For example, realizing a $50,000 gain from property or investments at age 63 or 64 ensures it won't impact taxable income during the years OAS begins, saving thousands in reduced benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Effective [[understanding_income_sources_and_withdrawal_strategies_in_retirement | understanding income sources and withdrawal strategies in retirement]] is vital to manage OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Integrating strategies like delaying CPP and OAS, wisely using TFSAs, managing RRIF withdrawals, and making strategic investment choices can help avoid the OAS clawback and preserve more retirement benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. These [[supplemental_income_strategies_for_retirees | supplemental income strategies for retirees]] can potentially save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. For complex cases involving retirement properties or businesses, professional financial planning can provide tailored solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

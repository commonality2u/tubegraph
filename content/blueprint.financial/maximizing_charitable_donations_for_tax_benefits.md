Donating to registered charities by December 31st can significantly reduce your tax bill through the charitable donation tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

## Federal and Provincial Tax Credits
The federal credit is 15% on the first $200 donated and 29% on amounts exceeding $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. Additional provincial credits vary by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. For instance, Alberta offers a high 60% donation tax credit on the first $200 donated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

> For example, if you donate $100 in Alberta, you would receive the 15% federal tax credit plus the 60% provincial tax credit, resulting in a $75 tax credit on that $100 donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Donations
*   **Donation Limit:** You can claim donations up to 75% of your net income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Carry Forward:** Unused donations can be carried forward for up to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Pooling:** Spouses or common-law partners can combine their donations for maximum benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.

[[using_tfsa_wisely_with_rrsp | Using your TFSA wisely with your RRSP]] allows you to control your taxable income in retirement, manage your tax bracket, reduce taxes, and keep your benefits intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26"></a>. The TFSA can be thought of as a "lever" to help manage taxable income strategically alongside your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17"></a>.

## Strategies for Combining TFSA and RRSP

Here are key strategies for making the most of these accounts together:

### 1. Using TFSA Withdrawals to Supplement RRSP Income

RRSP withdrawals are fully taxable and can quickly push you into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40"></a>. By pairing RRSP withdrawals with tax-free TFSA withdrawals, you can meet your income needs without reaching a higher marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49"></a>. This approach is particularly beneficial if you are also receiving taxable income from CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58"></a>.

**Example:**
John, aged 68, receives $20,000 annually from CPP and OAS but needs an additional $30,000 for expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05"></a>. Instead of withdrawing the entire $30,000 from his RRSP (which would increase his taxable income), John withdraws $10,000 from his RRSP and $20,000 from his TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21"></a>. This method helps John keep his taxable income low, remain within his desired tax bracket, and reduce his overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26"></a>.

### 2. Shifting Excess RRSP Funds to Your TFSA

Transferring excess funds from your RRSP to your TFSA is a smart move when you don't need all your RRSP withdrawals for living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35"></a>. This strategy helps avoid large RRIF minimum withdrawals in the future, which could otherwise push you into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50"></a>. Funds held in a TFSA benefit from tax-free growth and offer the flexibility of withdrawal at any time without additional tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56"></a>.

**Example:**
Sarah, aged 65, withdraws $4,000 from her RRSP for living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04"></a>. She also withdraws an additional $20,000 to contribute to her TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11"></a>. This action reduces her future RRIF minimum withdrawals and allows her funds to grow tax-free in her TFSA for future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13"></a>.

### 3. Preserving Government Benefits by Avoiding Income Clawbacks

TFSA withdrawals do not count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27"></a>. This makes them ideal for covering additional expenses without risking government benefit clawbacks, such as those for OAS or GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31"></a>. By managing your taxable income levels through strategic TFSA use, you can help ensure your government benefits remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"></a>.

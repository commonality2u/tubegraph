When relocating from Canada, it is crucial to understand how tax treaties affect tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected and negative tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Not Checking Tax Treaties and Tiebreaker Rules

Some countries have [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaties]] with Canada that include "tiebreaker rules" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These rules are designed to determine residency when both countries could potentially claim an individual as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### How Tax Treaties Determine Residency

If a new country has a tax treaty with Canada, the following criteria are typically used to resolve dual residency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:

*   **Permanent Home**: Where an individual has a permanent place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. If a permanent home exists in both countries, the next criterion is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Center of Vital Interests**: This assesses where an individual's personal and economic ties are strongest, including factors like family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Habitual Abode**: In which country does the individual habitually reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>?
*   **Physical Presence (183-Day Rule)**: Some countries automatically consider an individual a tax resident if they spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Example: Moving to the US

The US employs a "substantial presence test" to determine tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If an individual spends 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year, they could be considered a US tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This test considers individuals physically present in the US for at least 31 days during the current year, and a total of 183 days over the current and two preceding years, using a specific calculation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

However, under the Canada-US tax treaty, tiebreaker rules can resolve dual residency situations even if the substantial presence test is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. If the permanent residence and center of vital interests are still in Canada, the individual may be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

#### Case Study: Tiffany's Job Assignment in New York

Tiffany, a Canadian citizen, takes a one-year job assignment in New York starting in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She owns a condo in Toronto where her spouse and children reside, and she maintains her Canadian bank accounts and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

*   **Substantial Presence Test**: Tiffany spends more than 183 days in the US, qualifying her as a US tax resident under the IRS's substantial presence test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Tiebreaker Rules Assessment**:
    *   **Permanent Home**: Tiffany owns a home in Canada but rents an apartment in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   **Center of Vital Interests**: Her family and financial ties remain in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   **Habitual Abode**: Tiffany intends to return to Canada after one year, reinforcing her long-term Canadian residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   **Citizenship**: If uncertainty persists, her Canadian citizenship favors Canada as her tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Canada remains Tiffany's primary tax residency under the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. While the US may still tax her US income, she can avoid being fully taxed as a US resident on her worldwide income (e.g., investments or rental properties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Types of Canadian Tax Residency Status Related to Treaties

*   **Deemed Non-Resident**: This status applies when an individual qualifies as a tax resident in another country with a [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. In this scenario, Canada will not tax the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The key difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident is how tax residency is determined and whether a tax treaty applies, though both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

        If Canadians (often called snowbirds) spend more than 183 days in the US during a calendar year, they could be classified as a US tax resident and be subject to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Keeping track of days spent is crucial, and apps like Day Count or Taxbird can help avoid crossing the 183-day limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Impact on Canadian Income After Leaving

Even after leaving Canada, certain Canadian-sourced incomes could remain taxable for non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Understanding these obligations is important to avoid unexpected liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

[[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | Tax treaties]] can influence the withholding tax rates on income sources like CPP, OAS, and RSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

*   **Strategies to Reduce Withholding Tax**:
    *   **Filing Form NR5**: Non-residents can apply for a lower withholding tax rate on certain income by filing Form NR5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. If approved, taxes are withheld at a reduced rate based on expected Canadian tax liability for up to 5 years, requiring an annual Canadian tax return to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Electing Under Section 216 for Rental Income**: Non-residents with rental income can choose to pay tax on net rental income (gross rental income minus expenses) instead of the standard 25% withholding tax on the gross amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This often results in a lower tax liability and allows for deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A Section 216 tax return must be filed annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Tax Treaty Considerations**: Withholding tax rates vary by country under Canada's [[tax_treaties_and_withholding_tax_for_canadian_retirees_abroad | tax treaties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Before filing NR5 or Section 216, it's advisable to check if the new country has a tax treaty with Canada that automatically lowers withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. For instance, moving to the US will likely result in lower CPP, OAS, and RSP withholding tax rates than the standard 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Leaving Canada and navigating its [[canadian_tax_system | tax system]] as a non-resident, especially with other countries' tax systems involved, is an extremely complex issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Proper planning is essential to avoid paying unnecessary taxes or experiencing double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

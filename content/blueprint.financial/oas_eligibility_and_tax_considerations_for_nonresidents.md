The [[oas_benefits_and_tax_implications_for_nonresidents | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefit is an essential part of Canadian retirement income for many seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, when [[understanding_tax_implications_and_becoming_a_nonresident | Canadians move abroad]] to retire, the behavior of their OAS payments changes significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. OAS is a "wild card" among government benefits, as its portability and tax implications depend heavily on an individual's residency history and the tax treaties Canada has with their new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## OAS Eligibility for Nonresidents

Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), OAS is based on residency, not on work history or contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. To qualify for OAS while living outside of Canada, specific residency rules must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### The 20-Year Residency Rule

The primary rule for receiving OAS abroad states that you must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. If this threshold is met, your monthly OAS payment will continue, even if you are living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

> "Think of OAS like a loyalty card. It only works after 20 plus visits or years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>

For example, Pedro, who moved to Canada at age 25 and lived there for 30 years before retiring to Spain, continues to receive his full OAS payments because he met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### The 6-Month Rule (If 20-Year Rule Not Met)

If you do not meet the 20-year residency rule, your OAS could stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Specifically, if you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure, your OAS will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. To resume receiving it, you would have to return to Canada and reestablish residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Exceptions via Social Security Agreements

There are exceptions to the 20-year rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. You might still qualify for OAS abroad if you lived or worked in a country that has a [[social_security_agreements_and_their_role_in_oas_qualification | social security agreement with Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. In such cases, the combined time you lived in both countries must be at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. It's important to note that the years lived in another country do not increase your OAS amount; they only help determine if you qualify to keep receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Tax Considerations for Nonresidents

Your OAS payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Withholding Tax and Tax Treaties

While federal tax isn't automatically withheld each month, you can request voluntary tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. If you live outside Canada, your OAS may be subject to a nonresident withholding tax, with the default rate being 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

However, if you reside in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, that rate may be reduced or eliminated entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   For example, if you move to the US, Canada's tax treaty means your OAS is not subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Conversely, if you move to Germany, while a tax treaty exists, it does not eliminate withholding tax on OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Under Article 18 of the Canada-Germany tax treaty, Canada may tax public pensions like OAS at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Tax Filing Requirements

While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip each year instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. You must include this slip when filing your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. It's crucial to continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your OAS while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Planning Strategies for OAS

### Managing the OAS Clawback

If you are concerned about hitting the income threshold for the [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | OAS recovery tax]], also known as the clawback, which begins at $93,454 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, you can manage your taxable income through strategies such as:
*   RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>
*   Pension income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   Deferring OAS to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

### Example: Anita's Retirement to Portugal

Anita, a 67-year-old retiree moving to Portugal after 22 years of living and working in Canada, serves as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. She qualifies for her CPP and OAS (having crossed the 20-year residency threshold) and was receiving GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Portugal has a social security and tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

When Anita moves:
*   Her OAS continues because she met the 20-year requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Had she moved a year earlier, her OAS would have been suspended until she returned to Canada or qualified through a treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   Her GIS stops after 6 months, as it requires ongoing Canadian residency and has no workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Anita's successful planning included:
*   Delaying her move until she hit 20 years of residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Choosing a treaty country like Portugal to reduce tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Planning early to manage her budget without GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## OAS as a "Travel Companion"

When considering retirement abroad, think of OAS as a "selective" travel companion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It will only accompany you if you've built a strong enough relationship, meaning 20-plus years of living in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. If not, OAS might stay home unless you have "mutual friends" in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

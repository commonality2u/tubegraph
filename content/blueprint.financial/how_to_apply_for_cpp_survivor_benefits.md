The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) does not always cease upon death; certain benefits may continue to be paid to eligible survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These include the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]], the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] children's benefit, and the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] death benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## CPP Survivorship Pension

The [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]] provides financial support to the legal spouse or common-law partner of a deceased [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Eligibility Requirements
To qualify for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]], two main requirements must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **Relationship Status** You must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **[[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] Contributions** The deceased must have contributed to [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for at least 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Application Process
Applying for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]] is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. You need to complete the application form available on the Government of Canada's website and provide supporting documents, such as your spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Apply as soon as possible after your partner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond this period could result in lost benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This is particularly important to remember during the grieving process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
>
> **Example**: If Emma is eligible for $700 a month in [[cpp_survivor_benefit_amounts_and_calculations | CPP survivor benefits]] and waits 18 months to apply, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Amount and Calculation
The amount of the [[cpp_survivor_benefit_amounts_and_calculations | CPP survivorship pension]] received depends on two key factors: your age at the time of your spouse's death, and the amount your spouse contributed to the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of their actual age at passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

#### Scenarios for [[cpp_survivor_benefit_amounts_and_calculations | Survivor Benefit Calculations]] (Example: Deceased received $1,200/month CPP at age 65)
*   **Survivor under 65 years old**: The survivor receives a flat rate plus 37.5% of the deceased's calculated [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   For 2024, the flat rate is $227 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Example: $227 (flat rate) + 37.5% of $1,200 ($450) = $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Survivor 65 years old or older**: The survivor receives up to 60% of the deceased's calculated [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   Example: 60% of $1,200 = $720 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

#### Actual Average and Maximum Payments (2024)
Based on real-life data:
*   **Survivors under 65**: Average payment is $524 a month, with a maximum of $739 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This includes the flat rate and 37.5% of the deceased spouse's pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Survivors 65 or older**: Average payment is $323 per month, with a maximum of $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. These survivors receive 60% of their spouse's pension without the flat rate portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   The maximum payout is only achieved if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Maximum Survivor Pension Cap
There is a cap on the total [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits you can receive if you are also collecting your own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits and the survivorship pension cannot exceed the maximum [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Retirement Pension + Survivorship Pension Example**: If an individual receives $800/month from their own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension and qualifies for $700/month from a survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, due to the 2024 retirement cap of $1,375, their benefits would be reduced to that cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Disability Pension + Survivorship Pension Example**: If an individual receives $1,200/month from [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] disability benefits and qualifies for $500/month from a survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Due to the combined survivor and disability pension cap of $1,613 per month, their total benefits would be adjusted to $1,613 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

#### Advanced Planning Strategies for the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] Cap
Consider these [[financial_considerations_for_starting_cpp_payments | financial considerations for starting CPP payments]] after a spouse's death:
*   **Start [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments | CPP]] Early if Below the Cap**: If your own [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments | CPP]] early might allow you to collect both your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Delay [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments | CPP]] if Near the Cap**: If your expected [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] is close to the maximum, delaying your [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_benefits | CPP]] can maximize your overall benefit. This way, you receive a higher survivorship pension without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Duration of Survivorship Pension
The [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]] is received for life, as long as you are alive; there are no time limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Remarriage**: Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect your eligibility, and you will continue to receive the pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Death of the Survivor**: Payments will cease upon your death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## CPP Children's Benefit
If you have children, they may be eligible for the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] children's benefit, which provides financial support after the loss of a contributing parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit is available to both biological and adopted children of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Eligibility
To qualify for the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] child benefit, the child must be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>:
*   Under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, or
*   Between 18 and 25 years old and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Amount
In 2024, the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] child benefit offers a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is a set figure and is not based on the earnings of the survivor or the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### How to Apply
The application process is similar to the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | CPP survivorship pension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. You can apply through Service Canada and will need supporting documents, such as proof of enrollment in school for children between 18 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## CPP Death Benefit
The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] death benefit is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In some cases, it may be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This amount can help cover immediate expenses like funeral costs, easing the financial burden in the initial weeks after a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits
All [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] benefits mentioned, including the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility | survivorship pension]], child benefit, and death benefit, are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. You must report them on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

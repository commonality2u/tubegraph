Navigating the 2025 pension updates is crucial for effective [[retirement_planning_strategies_for_canadians | retirement planning]], helping individuals maximize benefits and save on taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Payment Dates in 2025

The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for CPP, OAS, and GIS in 2025, meaning recipients will receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These dates typically fall in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip:** For added convenience and reliability, set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account to ensure timely receipt of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Updates for 2025

### Cost of Living Adjustment
CPP payments are adjusted annually to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For 2025, the adjustment is 2.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This means a monthly payment of $1,000 in 2024 would increase to $1,026 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This adjustment aims to help retirees maintain their purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Two-Tier CPP System (CPP Enhancement)
The two-tier CPP system, also known as CPP enhancement, requires higher earners to contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

*   **First Tier (bcpp):**
    *   Applies to earnings up to $71,500 (known as the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings or YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Employee contribution: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Employer contribution: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Self-employed contribution: 11.9% (combined employee and employer rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

*   **Enhanced CPP (cpp2):**
    *   Applies to earnings between $71,300 and $81,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Employee and employer rate: 4% each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Self-employed contribution: 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

*   **Contribution Cap:** Contributions are capped at $4,420 for incomes over $81,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A $3,500 exemption from calculations is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   Example: An income of $40,000 would result in $2,171 in CPP contributions for an employee (not reaching the second tier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. At $80,000, total contributions would be $4,388, including the second tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. At $100,000, the maximum of $4,420 for 2025 is capped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Why it Matters:** This new system helps higher earners save more for retirement, with CPP potentially replacing up to 33.33% of lifetime earnings, an increase from the previous 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This can be viewed as an upgrade to a premium subscription, offering better payouts later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Updates for 2025

### Cost of Living Adjustment
OAS payments are reviewed quarterly to keep up with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For the January to March 2025 period, there will be no increase due to a small dip in the CPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, over the past year, benefits have still grown by 2%, assisting seniors with rising living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### OAS Clawback Threshold
The OAS pension recovery tax, known as the clawback, requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their OAS benefits if their net income exceeds a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   For July 2024 to June 2025, the threshold is $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Seniors with net income exceeding this amount must repay 15% of the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   Example: A net income of $100,000 would result in a repayment of approximately $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

*   **Strategies to Minimize Clawback:** Consider [[pension_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategies]] or utilizing a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) to help keep your net income below the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Increased OAS Pension at Age 75
Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This measure, introduced in July 2022, addresses financial challenges faced by older seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

*   For January to March 2025:
    *   Age 65 to 74: Maximum monthly payment is $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Age 75 or older: Maximum monthly payment increases to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) Updates for 2025

GIS provides financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Keeping Up with the Cost of Living
GIS payments are adjusted quarterly to match changes in the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. For January to March 2025, the maximum monthly GIS payment for a single senior remains at $1,086, as there was no CPI increase in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. However, GIS benefits have grown by 2% over the past year (January 2024 to January 2025), helping seniors keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Updated Income Thresholds
Eligibility for GIS depends on income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For the first quarter of 2025, the annual income limit for a single person is $22,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

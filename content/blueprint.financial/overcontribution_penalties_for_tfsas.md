Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can be [[penalties_and_taxation_of_tfsa_by_the_cra | penalized and taxed by the CRA]] if certain rules are not followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Avoiding specific "red flags" is crucial to keep your TFSA truly tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. One significant pitfall is overcontributing to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Overcontribution to Your TFSA

In 2020, one taxpayer significantly overcontributed to their TFSA by $639,950, using borrowed funds from a line of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Their plan to invest the excess funds into stocks and generate profits backfired spectacularly when the CRA intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Under the Income Tax Act, any overcontribution to a TFSA incurs a 1% penalty per month on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For this taxpayer, it resulted in a penalty of $6,393 per month for every month of overcontribution in 2020, not including additional penalties and interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The taxpayer claimed they did not understand the rules and even blamed their financial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. They pleaded for leniency, citing financial hardship and investment losses of up to 50% within the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Crucially, they did not withdraw the excess funds when instructed by the CRA, hoping the market would recover their losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. When the case went to Federal Court, the judge ruled against the taxpayer, stating that the overcontribution was not a reasonable error and their delay in removing funds violated the rule to fix such issues without delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

While most people may not make such an extreme mistake, many [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | overcontribute]] every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Common Overcontribution Mistakes

*   **Non-Resident Contributions**
    If you move abroad and are no longer a Canadian resident, contributing to your TFSA can result in a 1% monthly penalty on every dollar contributed while living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For instance, Jessica moved to the U.S. and continued contributing $6,000 to her TFSA, unaware that non-residents are not permitted to contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Because she didn't catch the mistake for several years, she incurred thousands of dollars in [[cra_penalties_on_tfsa_investments | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Trusting CRA's Online Contribution Limits**
    The CRA's online records may not always be up to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Relying solely on their figures can lead to accidental [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | overcontribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. It's recommended to keep your own records to avoid this pitfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Re-contributing in the Same Year**
    Withdrawing from your TFSA does not immediately restore your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Contribution room from withdrawals resets only on January 1 of the following calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Re-contributing the same amount too soon will result in [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Not Transferring Investments In Kind**
    When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the funds into your TFSA can inadvertently cause [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | overcontribution]] problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Instead, it's advisable to transfer investments "in kind" without selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Even with in-kind transfers, be cautious with timing to avoid potentially reducing your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Think of your TFSA as a tightly packed suitcase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Adding more than it can hold not only makes it burst but also incurs a hefty luggage fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Knowing the rules and acting quickly if an error occurs is crucial for [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties_and_technical_pitfalls | avoiding TFSA overcontribution penalties and technical pitfalls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

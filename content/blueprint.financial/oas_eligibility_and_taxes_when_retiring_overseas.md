For Canadians considering retirement abroad, understanding how their government income, including [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], behaves is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits are a "wild card" when it comes to living outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## [[impact_of_residency_and_timing_on_oas_eligibility | OAS Eligibility Abroad]]

Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] is based on your residency, not on your work history or contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. To qualify for [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] while living outside of Canada, you must meet specific residency rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The key rule is that you can receive [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] abroad if you've lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. If you meet this threshold, your monthly [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payment will continue, even if you are living permanently overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For example, Pedro, who moved to Canada at age 25 and lived there for 30 years before retiring to Spain, continues to receive his full [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments because he met the 20-year residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Think of [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] as a loyalty card that only works after 20-plus visits or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### What if you don't meet the 20-year rule?
If you lived in Canada for less than 20 years and leave the country for more than six consecutive months after the month of departure, your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] will be suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. To restart payments, you would have to return to Canada and reestablish residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Exceptions through Social Security Agreements
You might still qualify for [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] abroad even if you don't meet the 20-year rule if you lived or worked in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The combined time you lived in both countries must be at least 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. However, the years lived in another country do not increase your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] amount; they only help determine if you qualify to keep receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_and_tax_considerations_for_expatriates | Taxation of OAS When Living Abroad]]

Your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments are considered taxable income even when you live abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Withholding Tax
If you live outside of Canada, your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] may be subject to a non-resident withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The default rate is 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Impact of Tax Treaties
If you live in a country with a tax treaty with Canada, that rate may be reduced or eliminated entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **United States**: If you move to the US, Canada's tax treaty means your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] is not subject to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Germany**: If you move to Germany, Canada has a tax treaty in place, but it does not eliminate withholding tax on your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Instead, under Article 18 of the Canada-Germany tax treaty, Canada may tax public pensions like [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] at a rate not exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. You might end up paying about a 15% withholding tax on your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] payments while living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Filing Requirements
*   While abroad, you will receive an NR4 tax slip each year instead of a T4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. You'll need to include this when you file your annual tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   You must continue filing a Canadian tax return every year to keep receiving your [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] while abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## [[retirement_tax_strategies_for_canadians | OAS Recovery Tax (Clawback)]]

If you're concerned about hitting the income threshold for the [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] recovery tax, also known as the clawback, which begins at $93,454 in 2025, consider managing your taxable income through:
*   RRSP withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   Pension income splitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   Deferring [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] to age 70 for a higher benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>

## Example: Anita's Retirement to Portugal

Anita, aged 67, retired to Portugal after 22 years of living and working in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. She qualified for both CPP and [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]], having crossed the 20-year residency threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Portugal has a social security and tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

When she moved:
*   Her [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] continued because she met the 20-year requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Had she moved a year earlier, she would have received nothing until returning to Canada or qualifying through the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Anita did several things right:
*   She delayed her move until she hit 20 years of residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   She chose a treaty country like Portugal to reduce tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | OAS]] as a Travel Companion

Think of [[old_age_security_oas_benefits | OAS]] as a selective travel companion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It will only come with you if you've built a strong enough relationship, meaning 20-plus years of living in Canada after the age of 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. If not, it might just stay home, unless you have mutual friends in countries with a social security agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

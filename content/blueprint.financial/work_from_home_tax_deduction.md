Many Canadians working from home can claim a significant tax deduction, potentially saving hundreds or thousands of dollars [00:02:36].

## Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible for the work from home deduction, you must meet specific conditions [00:02:44]:
*   You must have worked from home more than 50% of the time for at least four consecutive weeks [00:02:44].
*   Your employer must not have reimbursed you for all of your [[home_office_expense_deduction | home office expenses]] [00:02:51].
*   You need to complete Form T2200S and have it signed by your employer [00:02:57].
*   You must retain all receipts and records of your expenses [00:03:02].

## Eligible Expenses

You can claim a portion of various expenses related to your home office [00:03:06]:
*   Utilities (e.g., electricity, heating, water) [00:03:08]
*   Internet [00:03:12]
*   Rent [00:03:14]
*   Office supplies [00:03:15]
*   Maintenance and minor repairs [00:03:16]

## Calculation Method

The deduction is calculated based on the proportion of your home used for work [00:03:19]:
1.  **Determine workspace percentage**: Measure the size of your workspace and your entire home to find the percentage of your home dedicated to work [00:03:20].
    *   For instance, if your workspace is 200 square feet and your home is 1,000 square feet, your workspace percentage is 20% [00:03:24].
2.  **Calculate deduction**: Multiply your total eligible expenses by your workspace percentage [00:03:32].
    *   For example, if your total eligible expenses are $5,000 and your workspace is 20% of your home, you can claim a deduction of $1,000 [00:03:37].

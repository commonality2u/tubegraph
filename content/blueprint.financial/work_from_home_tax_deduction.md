## Calculating the Deduction

The deduction amount is determined by calculating the percentage of your home used for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

1.  **Determine Workspace Percentage**: Measure the size of your dedicated workspace and the total size of your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
    > [!EXAMPLE] Workspace Percentage Calculation
    > If your workspace is 200 sq ft and your home is 1,000 sq ft, your workspace percentage is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
2.  **Multiply by Eligible Expenses**: Multiply your total eligible expenses by this workspace percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
    > [!EXAMPLE] Deduction Calculation
    > If your total eligible expenses are $5,000 and your workspace percentage is 20%, you can claim a deduction of $1,000 ($5,000 * 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

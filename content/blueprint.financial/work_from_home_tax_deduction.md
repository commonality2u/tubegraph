*   Have form T2200S signed by your employer [00:03:01].

## How to Calculate the Deduction

The deduction is calculated based on the percentage of your home used for work [00:04:18]:

1.  **Measure your workspace:** Determine the size of your dedicated workspace and compare it to the total size of your home to find the percentage used for work [00:04:20].
    *   **Example:** If your workspace is 200 sq ft and your home is 1,000 sq ft, your workspace percentage is 20% [00:04:24].
2.  **Calculate the deductible amount:** Multiply your total eligible expenses by your workspace percentage [00:04:31].
    *   **Example:** If your total eligible expenses are $5,000 and your workspace is 20%, you can claim a deduction of $1,000 [00:04:37].

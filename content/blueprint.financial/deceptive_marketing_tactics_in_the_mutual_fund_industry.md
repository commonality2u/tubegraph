Banks and financial institutions frequently employ "tricky marketing tactics" that can obscure the true performance and nature of mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20">[06:20]</a>. This contributes to the continued [[the_popularity_of_mutual_funds_in_canada | popularity of mutual funds in Canada]] despite their known drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25">[10:25]</a>.

## How Banks Cloud the Truth

Financial institutions commonly highlight only the success stories among mutual funds, showcasing top-performing funds in their advertisements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>. This selective reporting conveniently omits funds that have [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformed]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a>, were closed, or merged out of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43">[06:43]</a>. This practice creates an "illusion of consistent high performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48">[06:48]</a>, leading investors to believe in an overall high performance that does not reflect the full reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09">[07:09]</a>.

### Survivorship Bias

A key concept in understanding how mutual funds can mislead investors is **survivorship bias** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42">[07:42]</a>. This bias occurs when only funds that have survived are included in performance reports, while poorly performing funds that were merged or liquidated are excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49">[07:49]</a>. This results in a misleadingly positive portrayal of the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53">[07:53]</a>.

For example, over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated as of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>. On average, across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09">[08:09]</a>. Specifically:
*   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>.
*   For Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17">[08:17]</a>.

Banks and financial institutions exploit survivorship bias to their benefit, highlighting the success stories among mutual funds and exclusively showcasing the top performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42">[08:42]</a>.

## Misleading Ratings

Beyond selective reporting, marketing tools like Morningstar's five-star ratings can also mislead investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59">[11:59]</a>. Many studies have indicated that these "five-star funds" tend to [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform]] in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06">[12:06]</a>, contrary to investor expectations for better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03">[12:03]</a>.

Despite data showing otherwise, many people are drawn to mutual funds because they like to believe in the expertise of "genius fund managers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39">[11:39]</a>, hoping for high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43">[11:43]</a>. Financial advisors are adept at painting this appealing picture, and this marketing, combined with the trust in large financial institutions, persuades many to choose mutual funds over more cost-effective options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50">[11:50]</a>.

Ultimately, these tactics, alongside [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees associated with Canadian mutual funds]] and [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | low returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48">[04:48]</a>, can have a [[negative_impact_of_mutual_funds_on_wealth_growth | significant negative impact on wealth growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57">[13:57]</a>.

Building significant wealth, such as a seven-figure Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP), often doesn't require being the highest earner or a stock-picking genius. Instead, it relies on following key principles, particularly the strategic use of automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach allows individuals to "trick" their future selves into becoming rich by saving more without even noticing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## The Power of Automation in Saving

Many people believe that building wealth requires immense discipline and willpower. However, successful savers understand that automation can remove human error and make saving effortless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

Here are key [[setting_clear_financial_goals_and_automating_contributions | automation strategies for effortless saving]] employed by RSP millionaires:

### 1. Set Up Pre-Authorized Contributions
The most fundamental step is to set up automatic, pre-authorized RSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This ensures that money is moved to your RSP automatically on payday, preventing you from having a chance to spend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. This aligns with the "pay your RSP first" philosophy, treating savings like an essential bill rather than an optional leftover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### 2. Automate Annual Contribution Increases
Savings can grow without conscious effort by setting up an automatic annual increase in contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. For instance, if you get a 5% raise, you can immediately increase your RSP contributions by at least 2-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This "force scarcity trick" means you never truly feel the extra money, and therefore, never miss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### 3. Reinvest RSP Tax Refunds
While not strictly "automatic," a crucial strategy is to consistently reinvest your RSP tax refund back into your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Many people spend these refunds on non-essential items like vacations or gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. By reinvesting, you can add tens or even hundreds of thousands to your portfolio over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### 4. Maximize "Free Money" Opportunities
Take full advantage of any "free money" sources, which often come with automated components:
*   **Employer RSP Matching** Don't leave employer matching contributions on the table, as this is essentially free money for your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Spousal RSPs** Utilize spousal RSPs to help balance taxes in retirement, which can be part of [[planning_and_implementing_taxsaving_strategies | tax-saving strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Deduction Carry Forwards** Claim deduction carry forwards when they will save the most tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## The Benefit of Automated Saving

Comparing two savers:
*   **Jennifer**, who saves manually, often forgets or finds other needs for her money, leading to inconsistent or zero savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. After 30 years, she's constantly playing catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Sophie**, on the other hand, automates everything, with her RSP contributions happening without her lifting a finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

After 30 years, Sophie is far wealthier, not necessarily because she earned more, but because she eliminated human error from her [[retirement_savings_growth_strategies | savings process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This highlights why [[setting_clear_financial_goals_and_automating_contributions | automating contributions]] is a cornerstone of [[strategies_for_sustainable_retirement_savings | sustainable retirement savings]].

While the focus is on growth and contribution, it's also crucial to have an RSP exit strategy to ensure tax-efficient withdrawals in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This includes [[taxfree_savings_account_withdrawal_strategy | strategies for maximizing tax-free savings for a down payment]] or coordinating withdrawals with other income sources to avoid high tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Ignoring this can lead to paying far more in taxes than necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

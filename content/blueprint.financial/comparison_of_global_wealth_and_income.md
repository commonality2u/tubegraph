When assessing personal financial standing, it can be beneficial to adopt a global perspective on wealth and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. While individuals often compare themselves to friends, colleagues, or social media influencers, a worldwide view reveals significant disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Canadian Income in a Global Context

A global wealth calculator indicates that a single person earning $30,000 in Canada is considered to be in the high-income group worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This income translates to approximately $56 per day in purchasing power parity dollars, which is substantially higher than the earnings of most of the global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Many people globally live on just a few dollars a day, with limited access to essential services such as clean water and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Viewing financial challenges through this broader lens can help reframe difficulties and encourage more informed financial decisions, even if it doesn't eliminate financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivorship pension provides financial support to the legal spouse or common-law partner of a deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This pension continues after death, offering a [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | lifeline]] to help maintain financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

To qualify for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_requirements | CPP survivorship pension]], the deceased must have contributed to CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for at least 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. It is crucial to apply for the survivorship pension as soon as possible after a partner's death, as retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, and delays can result in lost funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Calculating the Survivorship Pension

The amount of the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_requirements | CPP survivorship pension]] depends on two [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | key factors]]: the survivor's age at the time of the spouse's death and the amount the deceased spouse contributed to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of death, regardless of their actual age of passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Survivor Under 65**: The survivor receives a flat rate amount ($227 for 2024) plus 37.5% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For example, if the deceased's CPP was $1,200 per month at age 65, the survivor would receive $450 (37.5% of $1,200) + $227, totaling $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Survivor 65 or Older**: The survivor receives up to 60% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For instance, if the deceased's CPP was $1,200 per month, the survivor would receive 60% of $1,200, which is $720 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Average vs. Maximum Payments

Looking at real-life data, the [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | average payment]] and [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum]] amounts for CPP survivor benefits are:

*   **Under 65**:
    *   [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | Average payment]]: $524 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
    *   [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | Maximum]]: $739 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   **65 or Older**:
    *   [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | Average payment]]: $323 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>
    *   [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | Maximum]]: $818 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

The difference between the [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | average]] and [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum]] payments indicates that many survivors do not receive the full potential benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This is often due to the deceased spouse's contribution history or the survivor's own CPP benefits affecting the payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The [[average_vs_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum]] payout is only achievable if the deceased spouse contributed the [[factors_determining_maximum_cpp_benefits | maximum]] allowable amounts to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Maximum Survivor Pension Cap Explained

There is a cap on the total CPP benefits an individual can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of personal CPP benefits and the survivorship pension cannot exceed the [[maximum_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_different_scenarios | maximum CPP retirement]] or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Here are examples illustrating how this cap works:

*   **Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension (Hitting the Cap)**
    *   If a survivor receives $800/month from their own CPP retirement pension and qualifies for $700/month from the survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   However, due to the retirement cap (e.g., $1,375), their benefits would be reduced to that cap amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Lower Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension (Below the Cap)**
    *   If a survivor's CPP retirement pension is $400/month and they qualify for $600/month from the survivorship pension, their combined total is $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
    *   Since this is below the cap, they would receive the full $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Disability Pension Combined with Survivorship Pension**
    *   If a survivor receives $1,200/month from CPP disability benefits and qualifies for $500/month from the survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   Due to the combined survivor and disability pension cap (e.g., $1,613 per month), their total benefits would be adjusted to that cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

### [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | Advanced Planning Strategies]] Around the CPP Cap

Financial planning can help navigate these caps:

*   **Start CPP Early if You're Below the Cap**: If your CPP retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting CPP early might be a good option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This allows for collecting both your CPP and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For example, if combined CPP is $900, it's well below the $1,375 retirement cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Delay CPP if You're Near the Cap**: If your expected CPP is close to the maximum, delaying your CPP can maximize your overall benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This strategy allows you to receive a higher survivorship pension without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. For example, if combined CPP is $1,600, exceeding the $1,375 cap, delaying CPP to age 70 will increase your later CPP benefit while still allowing the full survivorship benefit from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Duration of Survivorship Pension

The [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_requirements | CPP survivorship pension]] is received for [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life]], with no time limits as long as the survivor is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Payments stop upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Taxability of Benefits

All CPP benefits, including the survivorship pension, child benefit, and the [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | death benefit]], are taxable and must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

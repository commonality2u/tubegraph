## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) Portability

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit designed to support low-income seniors who reside in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Unlike the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), GIS is not portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and is strictly tied to physical presence in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Impact of Moving Abroad on GIS Payments

If you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. There is no social security agreement that can protect your GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Example**: Gan, a 71-year-old retiree, had her GIS terminated a few months after moving to Mexico because she was outside Canada for more than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Even if you meet the [[gis_income_thresholds_and_payments | income threshold]] for payments, GIS will not follow you abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Planning for GIS Loss

If GIS is a crucial part of your [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | retirement income]], it is essential to consider this limitation before relocating outside Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. You may need to delay your move, adjust your budget, or explore other income options to replace the loss of GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Residency Trick / Snowbird Move**: Some retirees maintain part-year residency in Canada to keep their benefits and tax status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This involves spending winters in warmer locations like Florida or Mexico, but ensuring they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Summary of GIS Portability

In summary, when considering [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_when_living_overseas | living overseas]] in retirement:
> [!info] Your travel companions: GIS
> Your GIS is like a friend who "just loves Canada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. It is generous while you are in Canada, but once you leave for more than six months, "they'll totally ghost you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. There is "no treaty, no workaround, and not even a goodbye" for GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

| Benefit | Behavior When Leaving Canada |
| :------ | :--------------------------- |
| **GIS** | Stops after 6 months. Requires ongoing Canadian residency. No workaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. |

A common misunderstanding among Canadians is how [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets|federal tax brackets]] work, particularly when receiving a raise that seemingly pushes them into a higher bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can lead to the belief that earning more money might actually result in taking home less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Common Misconception

When an individual's income increases, for example, from $55,000 to $60,000 a year, they might enter a new [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets|federal tax bracket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. For instance, moving from a 15% bracket to a 20.5% bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The [[misconceptions_about_taxes|mistake]] many make is thinking their entire salary will now be taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This perspective makes people feel they are "losing money by earning more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How Tax Brackets Actually Work

Canada's tax system operates on a progressive model, not a flat rate across the entire income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This means different portions of income are taxed at different rates:
*   The first portion of income, up to a certain threshold, is taxed at the lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, the first $57,375 of income might still be taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. If an income increases by $2,625 (from $57,375 to $60,000), only that additional $2,625 is taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The initial $57,375 remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Consequently, an individual's average or "effective tax rate" is significantly lower than the highest marginal tax bracket they enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Benefits of Earning More

Even if an individual enters a higher [[canadian_federal_tax_brackets|tax bracket]], they will always take home more money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. More income is always beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Therefore, [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes|tax misconceptions]] should not deter someone from pursuing a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

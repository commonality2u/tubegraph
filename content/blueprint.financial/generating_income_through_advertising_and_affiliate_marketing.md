The creator of wealthawesome.com, a finance blog started in 2019, initially aimed to earn $3,000 a month from the website and attract 30,000 monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This goal was significantly exceeded, almost by 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The website generated income primarily through advertising and [[understanding_income_sources_and_withdrawals | affiliate commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>, ultimately earning over $500,000, excluding the sale of the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

## How Income Was Generated

### Advertising on the Website
Once a website reaches a certain traffic threshold, it can apply for premium ad networks that connect publishers with advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
The creator joined Mediavine after reaching 50,000 visitors per month, though their requirement has since lowered to 10,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

*   **RPM (Revenue Per Mille)**: Ad networks typically pay based on RPM, which measures the earnings per 1,000 visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **High RPM for Finance Content**: For finance-related content with Mediavine, RPMs were very high, reaching $50 USD per 1,000 visitors at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This meant 10,000 visitors could generate approximately $500 USD (or nearly $700 Canadian) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Affiliate Commissions
Affiliate commissions involve earning money by recommending and referring specific products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. The creator's strategy was to only choose products they genuinely believed in and personally used, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

*   **Process**: An example provided is an article reviewing top Canadian trading platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. The article included links to recommended products, and if a reader signed up through those links, a commission was received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
*   **Commission Amounts**: Commissions typically ranged from $50 to $100, with some partners paying even more, like $150 or $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This system was considered a "win-win scenario," as users signed up for valuable products, and the creator was compensated for the referral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Journey and Milestones

### Financial Growth
*   **First Income**: It took about a year after starting the site for the first dollar to be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. In November 2020, a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade was received after writing over 150 articles and dedicating hundreds of hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **Goal Achieved**: The initial goal of $3,000 a month was reached in February 2021, approximately 1.5 years after the site's launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
*   **Peak Earnings**: In its best months, the site earned over $20,000 a month, almost reaching $30,000 at one point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Total Earnings**: In total, over $500,000 was made from the website, not including the sale of the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

### Traffic Growth
Traffic to the site started slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Traction**: It wasn't until about 100 articles were written, roughly 11 months into the journey (around August 2020), that traffic began to gain traction, reaching about 5,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Growth**: By January 2021, traffic had increased tenfold to 50,000 visitors a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Peak Performance**: The site peaked at approximately 250,000 visitors per month during its height in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   **Overall Reach**: In total, about 5 million visitors came to the site over the years, which is considered a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   **YouTube Channel**: A linked YouTube channel also achieved nearly 14,000 subscribers and 1 million visitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

## Lessons Learned

The experience of building and monetizing wealthawesome.com provided numerous valuable lessons:

*   **Technical Skills**: Acquired skills in website design and building, search engine optimization (SEO), writing, and graphic creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.
*   **Business Management**: Learned to analyze website data, build an affiliate partner network, monetize a website, hire and manage people, and utilize various online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience**: Previous roles as an analyst aided in SEO and outreach data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>; business-to-business sales experience helped promote the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>; and experience as a financial advisor contributed to creating useful content and connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Toughness**: One of the most important lessons was managing the challenges and ups and downs of running a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This involved learning to "ride out the bad results" and continue working, recognizing that not everything can be fixed or controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck**: The timing of starting the site right before the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending more time online learning about personal finance, was a significant factor in its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. The creator acknowledged that while control over everything isn't possible, one can control their reaction to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

## Sale of the Website

The website was eventually sold for several reasons:
*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the creator found it increasingly difficult to stay motivated and produce amazing content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>, realizing that once the "fire" is lost, it might be time to move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty of Blogging's Future**: Concerns about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates caused stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>, leading to a desire to [[importance_of_diversified_income_sources | diversify away]] from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   **Sale Process**: The site was sold to a close friend and former colleague, Q, who was building a portfolio of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The sale ensured the site went to someone trusted who could bring fresh ideas and manage its new direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

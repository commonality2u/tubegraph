While many people focus on income as a key financial indicator of success, it is [[importance_of_tracking_net_worth | net worth]] that truly determines financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:01">[02:25:01]</a>.

## Defining Net Worth

[[understanding_net_worth_classes_in_canada | Net worth]] is simply the total value of what you own (assets like cash, investments, and property) minus what you owe (debts like mortgages, loans, and credit cards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:54">[02:31:54]</a>.

## Why Net Worth Outweighs Income

A high income alone does not guarantee financial success if it is not managed effectively. For instance, someone earning $250,000 a year but spending it all could be worse off in the long run than someone making $80,000 who invests wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:27">[02:39:27]</a>. This highlights that "building your net worth isn't just about income. It's about strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:48">[14:35:48]</a>. The focus shifts from merely earning to strategically saving and investing to grow your assets while managing liabilities.

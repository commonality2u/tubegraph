Real estate plays a significant role in [[household_net_worth_in_canada | Canadian household net worth]], often making up a substantial portion of total wealth and driving growth trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Real Estate's Influence on Overall Net Worth
Real estate is a major component of [[canadian_net_worth_by_class | Canadian wealth]], consistently contributing over 50% to [[household_net_worth_in_canada | household net worth]] during the period from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It peaked at nearly 56% in 2022, highlighting the country's reliance on property for wealth accumulation and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Real estate was a primary driver for the increase in [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] from $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, a heavy reliance on real estate means that any downturn in the housing market could severely impact households, potentially wiping out a large portion of their [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Diversify Your Portfolio
> While real estate might seem like a safe investment, it's crucial to diversify your portfolio across various asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and other investments to mitigate risks in volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Homeowners Versus Renters: A Growing Wealth Gap
The data reveals a significant [[wealth_gap_between_homeowners_and_renters_in_canada | wealth gap between homeowners and renters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In 2024, homeowners had an average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of $1.38 million, which is almost five times higher than renters, who averaged $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Real estate appreciation is the main reason for this disparity, substantially boosting the [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Renters, who have limited exposure to real estate, primarily build wealth through financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Impact Across Age Groups
[[comparison_of_average_canadian_net_worth_by_age_group | Net worth evolves through different stages of life]], with real estate playing a significant role during peak wealth accumulation phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

*   **35 to 44 years:** This is a key stage for investing in assets like real estate and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] for this group reached $658,000 in 2024, up from $490,000 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **45 to 64 years:** [[household_net_worth_in_canada | Net worth]] peaks in these age groups, driven considerably by real estate and retirement growth, marking the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. In 2024, those aged 45 to 54 had $1.35 million in [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]], and 55 to 64-year-olds reached $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Influence on Household Type
[[impact_of_household_type_on_net_worth_in_canada | When comparing one-person and multi-person households]], a wealth gap is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By 2024, multi-person households had nearly double the [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] of one-person households ($1.17 million vs. $634,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This difference is largely due to multi-person households possessing larger total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, often linked to having two income providers and shared expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Real estate remains a major factor for both groups, accounting for 55% of [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] for multi-person households and 45% for one-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This disparity suggests that multi-person households might be more able to afford property, while one-person households face challenges in the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## International Comparison
Canada's average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] sits between that of the UK and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. However, Australia stands out, with a median [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] 80% higher and an average [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] 34% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. These figures are likely supported by Australia's significant housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

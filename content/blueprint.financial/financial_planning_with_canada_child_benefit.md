The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at $293,000 from birth to age 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This amount is roughly equivalent to the cost of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The [[canada_child_benefit_explained | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) can significantly offset these costs, potentially covering almost half of the total expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## What is the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)?

The [[canada_child_benefit_explained | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) is a tax-free payment designed to help families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Indexed to Inflation**: The benefit amount grows over time to keep pace with rising costs, meaning future payments will be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Completely Tax-Free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, with no deductions or surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Usage of Funds
There are no restrictions on how the CCB money can be spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Families can use it for necessities like food, housing, education, or any other family needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## How Much Can You Receive?

If a family qualifies for the maximum CCB, they can receive up to $125,500 per child over 18 years, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Maximum Annual Payments Per Child
*   **Children under six**: Up to $7,778 per year, totaling $46,672 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **Children aged six to seventeen**: The annual maximum is $6,570, adding up to $78,840 over twelve years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Combined, this can be up to $125,500 over 18 years per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Impact of Multiple Children
There is no limit to the number of children for whom you can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **One child**: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Two children**: Doubles to about $251,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Three children**: A total of around $376,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A family with 18 children, for example, could receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### CCB vs. Cost of Raising a Child
The average cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 for a two-parent, middle-income family is estimated at $293,000, or about $17,235 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. For lower-income families earning less than $83,000, the average cost is around $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. In this scenario, the CCB could cover over 50% of the total cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Eligibility and Calculation of Canada Child Benefit

The [[eligibility_and_calculation_of_canada_child_benefit | Canada Child Benefit]] is based on your Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For married or common-law couples, this is the combined income of both spouses, minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. As your AFNI increases, your CCB amount decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Income-Based Reductions
The CCB amount is reduced in stages based on your family's net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:
1.  **First Reduction Stage**: If your income is between $36,525 and approximately $79,000, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income above $36,525 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
2.  **Second Reduction Stage**: If your income is above approximately $79,000, an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over that threshold, after the initial reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

For example, for one child under six:
*   Families earning $35,000 or less receive the full annual benefit of $7,777 (or $649 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   At $50,000 net income, the annual benefit is reduced to about $6,884 ($570 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   At $100,000 family net income, the annual benefit drops to around $2,776 ($231 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   At $130,000 income, the benefit is approximately $1,814 per year ($151 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   At very high income levels, the benefit will be phased out completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

For exact calculations, especially with multiple children, it is recommended to use the CRA's CCB calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The CRA is also available to assist with any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## How to Get Paid

Receiving the CCB is straightforward. Once you file your taxes, the CRA automatically calculates your payments; no extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Requirements
*   You and your partner must file your taxes every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Your child must be registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Payment Details
*   Set up direct deposit with the CRA for faster payments, avoiding delays from mailed checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   CCB payments typically occur between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Updating Information
It is crucial to keep your information up to date with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>:
*   **Income Changes**: If your family's income changes due to job loss, you might qualify for higher payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Life Events**: Events such as marriage, the birth of a new baby, or divorce should be reported immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Shared Custody**: Inform the CRA about changes in shared custody arrangements, as they typically split payments 50/50 between parents in joint custody situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of Canada Child Benefit

The CCB is a vital tool for reducing child poverty and supporting families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Positive Outcomes
*   **Poverty Reduction**: Since its launch, the CCB has helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Family Support**: In 2021 alone, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Demographic Impact**: The CCB also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging family growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

[[income_splitting_to_reduce_tax_burden | Income splitting]] is a strategy that can lead to significant tax savings for couples, with some even saving over six figures in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It involves a carefully choreographed dance between partners to avoid higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

For couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, [[income_splitting_to_reduce_tax_burden | income splitting]] offers an easy way to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## How CPP Income Splitting Works

You can shift up to 50% of CPP benefits from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This strategy reduces the household tax bill and can even help avoid the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

It's important to note that this differs from [[employersponsored_pension_income_splitting | employer-sponsored pension income splitting]], which has its own rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Example: Ted and Robin's CPP Splitting Plan

Consider Ted and Robin:
*   Ted receives $12,000 annually in CPP benefits and is taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Robin receives $6,000 in CPP benefits and is taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

By splitting Ted's CPP income, they can shift $3,000 to Robin, leading to tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Results of the Strategy

Without splitting, Ted would pay more in taxes because his income falls into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. However, by shifting $3,000 of CPP income to Robin, their overall tax bill is lowered by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Combined Strategies

The true power of [[income_splitting_to_reduce_tax_burden | income splitting]] comes when multiple strategies are combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Along with CPP splitting, a couple could also consider:
*   Contributing to a First Home Savings Account (FHSA) for one partner to claim a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Using [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]] in retirement to balance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   Adding spousal RRSP contributions to create more tax-deferred savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

Together, these [[income_splitting_strategies_in_canada | strategies]] can seamlessly lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals like saving for a home or planning for a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

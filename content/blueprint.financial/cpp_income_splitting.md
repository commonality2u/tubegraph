[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] can be a complex topic, but it offers significant potential for tax savings for couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Some couples have even saved over six figures in taxes through careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Splitting CPP Income

For couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, [[tax_implications_of_cpp | income splitting]] is an easy way to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### How it Works

You can shift up to 50% of CPP benefits from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This strategy reduces your household tax bill and may even help you avoid the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin

Consider Ted and Robin's CPP splitting plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>:
*   Ted receives $12,000 annually in CPP benefits and is taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   Robin receives $6,000 in CPP benefits and is taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

By splitting Ted's CPP income, they can shift $3,000 to Robin, resulting in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

#### Results of the Strategy
*   **Without Splitting:** Ted would pay more in taxes because his income falls into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **With Splitting:** Shifting $3,000 of CPP income to Robin lowers their overall tax bill by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Combining Strategies

The real benefits of [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] emerge when multiple strategies are combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. For instance, a couple could use [[fhsa_for_income_splitting | FHSA for income splitting]] for one partner, then use [[pension_income_splitting | pension income splitting]] in retirement, and add [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | spousal RRSP contributions]] to create more tax-deferred savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. These combined strategies can seamlessly lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

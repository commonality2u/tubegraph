A significant number of Canadians are choosing to leave the country permanently, with 106,000 departing in 2024 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This mass exodus is often driven by the desire to escape high costs and taxes, as well as the fear of outliving retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Many are opting to [[benefits_and_drawbacks_of_retiring_abroad_for_canadians | retire abroad]] to find more affordable living environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | The High Cost of Living in Canada]]

Canada has become an expensive place to live, especially for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives a combined $1,300 to $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount, which might have been sufficient decades ago, is often inadequate for a modest lifestyle in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

For instance, in Toronto:
*   Average rent for a one-bedroom apartment is about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Utilities add $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   Groceries cost around $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   A transit pass is $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

These basic expenses easily exceed $3,000 per month for someone who doesn't own a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. CPP and OAS benefits barely cover a third of this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Numbeo estimates that a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month *without* rent, pushing total monthly costs to $3,500-$4,000 when rent is included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This financial strain leads many Canadians to delay retirement or seek options elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The Toronto Retirement Scenario: Seth's Struggle

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Living in Toronto, he plans to spend $50,000 annually, supplementing his $18,000 in CPP and OAS benefits with RRSP and TFSA withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   By age 70, his TFSA is depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals of over $46,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   By age 74, his savings are gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   By age 76, his net worth turns negative, illustrating the difficulty of sustaining retirement in a high-cost city like Toronto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## [[countries_where_canadians_can_live_affordably | Retiring Abroad: A Financial Solution]]

Many Canadians are moving to places where their money stretches further, allowing them to live comfortably on a lower income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Numbeo is a useful tool for getting a rough idea of global living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Mexico (Cancun)

Mexico is a top choice for Canadian retirees seeking warmth, affordability, and proximity to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Year-round sunshine in beach towns (Cancun, Puerto Vallarta) or mild, spring-like weather in cities (Guadalajara) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable private clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Dental work can be significantly cheaper than in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Private insurance is essential as public healthcare is not typically available to foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Residency**: The temporary resident visa is suitable for retirees, requiring about $103,000 CAD in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Direct flights from most major Canadian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Drawbacks**: Safety concerns vary by region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Infrastructure can be inconsistent in smaller towns, and bureaucracy requires patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

**Seth's Outcome in Cancun:**
In Cancun, a single person renting a one-bedroom apartment spends approximately $1,700 CAD per month, or about $20,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. With these lower costs, Seth's CPP and OAS benefits cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. His portfolio grows:
*   Age 70: $387,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>
*   Age 80: $586,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
*   Age 90: Over $900,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>
This illustrates the significant financial advantage of a lower cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Portugal (Porto)

Portugal offers a laid-back European lifestyle with old-world charm, a slower pace, great weather, and relatively affordable living costs for Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Climate**: Mild winters, sunny summers. The Algarve has near year-round beach weather, while Porto and Lisbon are cooler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent system. Residents can access the public system, and private care is also affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Residency**: Canadians can apply for the D7 passive income visa, requiring steady income sources (CPP, pensions, investments) of about €870 per month ($1,400 CAD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Farther than Mexico, but Lisbon and Porto offer direct flights to Toronto and Montreal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Cost**: Portugal's costs fall between Canada and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. In Porto, rent might be $1,300 per month, with other expenses adding $1,700, totaling around $3,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

**Seth's Outcome in Portugal:**
In Porto, Seth's annual spending is about $36,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. With $300,000 in savings and $18,000 annually from CPP and OAS, he draws from his TFSA and then RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   By age 75, savings drop to $199,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   By age 80, savings are just over $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   By age 84, his savings are depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Portugal offers a better outcome than Toronto, but with $3,000 per month in expenses, Seth's savings still run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Small adjustments, like delaying CPP to age 70 and strategically drawing from RRSP earlier, could extend his savings by a couple of years, but further planning (e.g., working longer, trimming spending, earning hobby income) would be needed to reach age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Thailand

Thailand remains one of the best value retirement destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Diverse options from cooler mountains (Chiang Mai) to beaches (Phuket, Hua Hin) and city energy (Bangkok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Modern, affordable, and considered among the best in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. English-speaking doctors and excellent private hospitals are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Residency**: Retirement visa requires being 50 or older and showing 800,000 Thai baht (about $33,000 CAD) in a Thai bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Chiang Mai, a full lifestyle including rent, food, and leisure can be $1,200 to $1,600 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This could be a perfect fit for someone receiving $1,500 per month from CPP and OAS, allowing savings to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Paraguay

Paraguay is an "under the radar" option gaining interest due to its tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Tax System**: Operates on a territorial tax system, meaning foreign income (CPP, OAS, RIFs, pensions) is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Local income is taxed at a flat 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Asunción, living expenses can be around $628 per month, with a one-bedroom rent at $583 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This means living well on just over $1,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Residency**: Offers pathways to permanent residency with minimal hassle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Financial Sweet Spot**: Very low cost, tax-efficient, and simple to settle long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Spain (Alicante)

Spain offers a European lifestyle with sunny coastlines, world-class food, and rich history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Excellent, with affordable private insurance required for non-EU residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living**: In Alicante, monthly living costs are around $1,570, with city center one-bedroom rent at $1,300. Total monthly expenses range from $2,400 to $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is comparable to or slightly cheaper than some parts of Canada or Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Residency**: The non-lucrative visa for Canadians requires an annual income of about $40,000 to $45,000 CAD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This is a higher bar, but achievable with careful planning such as earlier RRSP withdrawals or delaying CPP to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: Higher-end lifestyle, strong infrastructure, great weather, and access to the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Retiring Abroad

### [[implications_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Old Age Security (OAS) Rule]]

A critical mistake for Canadians retiring abroad is potentially losing OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   If you apply for OAS while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   However, if you live *outside* Canada, you need 20 years of residency to continue receiving payments long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   If you have between 10 and 20 years of Canadian residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving Canada, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   For example, David, with 15 years of Canadian residency, moved to Thailand (which has no social security agreement with Canada) and his OAS stopped after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Other Challenges and Advice

*   **Research**: Always use tools like Numbeo to compare costs like rent, food, and utilities for your target country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Budgeting**: Do not rely solely on CPP and OAS. Account for inflation, currency shifts, and unexpected healthcare costs, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle**: Life abroad is not for everyone. Be prepared for distance from family, new systems, and potential language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Planning**: A low-cost retirement requires a solid financial plan, including understanding tax rules and making significant financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Professional advice can help map out costs, taxes, and "what-ifs" to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is intensifying its efforts to recover an estimated over $20 billion annually in missing tax revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This crackdown has led to a significant increase in audits and harsher penalties, with more Canadians being flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## AI and Machine Learning in Tax Enforcement

The CRA is leveraging advanced technologies like AI and machine learning to combat tax fraud and evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. These tools enable the CRA to analyze vast amounts of data, quickly identifying suspicious patterns and inconsistencies in tax filings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. An AI system is likely to flag a problematic return before a human auditor even reviews it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Key applications of AI include:
*   **AI-Driven Audit Selection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>: Instead of solely relying on random audits, the CRA uses advanced analytics to flag returns with unusual deductions, excessive claims, or inconsistent income reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Automated Fraud Detection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>: Machine learning models recognize patterns from past fraudulent filings to detect new cases in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **GST/HST Return Fraud Crackdown** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>: Businesses or individuals filing for unwarranted tax refunds, rebates, or input tax credits are automatically cross-checked against financial and corporate records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Discrepancies may lead to an audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **New Data Sharing Agreements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>: Agreements with banks and foreign financial institutions allow the CRA to compare tax filings with banking data and offshore disclosures, making it significantly harder to hide unreported income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Who's at Risk from AI Scrutiny?
With these high-tech tools, the CRA is more adept at identifying tax fraud, and certain taxpayers are more likely to be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These include:
*   **People Making Excessive or Inconsistent Claims** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>: If deductions seem disproportionately high relative to income, or reported earnings fluctuate drastically year-to-year without clear justification, returns can be flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The CRA's AI compares filings to similar taxpayers to spot anomalies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Even minor unreported income amounts can trigger significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Individuals and Businesses Filing for Unwarranted GST/HST Refunds** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>: Inflating expenses, underreporting sales, or falsely claiming tax rebates will attract CRA scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The agency particularly targets businesses using shell companies or questionable bookkeeping to manipulate tax credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## [[cras_expanded_audit_powers_and_penalties | CRA's Expanded Audit Powers and Penalties]]

Proposed changes introduced in Budget 2024 aim to strengthen tax enforcement, potentially making audits more aggressive and invasive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These changes seek to close a $20 billion tax gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Proposed changes include:
*   **Fines for Non-Compliance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>: The CRA can issue a Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC), resulting in a $50 per day fine (up to $25,000) for failing to fully cooperate with an audit request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The CRA can also pause the reassessment period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Questioning Under Oath** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>: The CRA would gain the power to compel taxpayers to provide oral statements under oath or affirmation, a significant departure from current procedures, often without standard legal protections or formal transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Severe Compliance Penalties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>: Failing to comply with a court-issued order could result in a 10% penalty on the total tax bill for the years in question; even withholding a single document could trigger this fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Extended Audit Deadlines** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>: Challenging an NNC or a CRA demand in court could indefinitely extend the reassessment period until the case is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

These expanded powers mean audits could become more aggressive, time-consuming, and costly, potentially leading to penalties before an audit even concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## [[real_estate_and_cashbased_businesses_under_cra_scrutiny | Real Estate and Cash-Based Businesses Under CRA Scrutiny]]

The CRA is increasing audit activities in real estate and cash-based businesses due to concerns about unreported income, undeclared capital gains, and tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. With enhanced data tracking and increased enforcement funding, these sectors are under more scrutiny than ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Who's at Risk?
*   **Real Estate Investors, House Flippers, and Landlords** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>: Those misusing the principal residence exemption to avoid capital gains taxes are under scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Selling multiple properties can raise questions about whether the seller is truly a homeowner or engaged in flipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Landlords, especially those renting through platforms like Airbnb or VRBO, are at risk if they fail to report rental income correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The Underused Housing Tax (UHT) is also a focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Cash-Based Businesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>: Industries such as restaurants, bars, construction companies, and auto repair shops are prime targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Businesses predominantly dealing in cash have a higher risk of underreporting sales or inflating expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Suspiciously low reported earnings compared to industry standards may lead to an audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Crackdown on Aggressive Tax Planning and Evasion

The CRA is adopting a tougher stance on aggressive tax planning and tax evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Complex tax strategies, particularly those involving offshore accounts or sophisticated corporate structures, face increased scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

Key areas of focus include:
*   **Offshore Tax Evasion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>: Canada collaborates with over 100 countries through the Common Reporting Standard, enabling financial institutions worldwide to share data with tax authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Undeclared foreign assets or income are more likely to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Corporate Tax Planning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>: Businesses employing strategies like income shifting, artificial losses, or questionable tax credits are subject to tougher audits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Tax Shelters** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>: Setups designed to conceal income through trusts, numbered companies, and shell corporations, often aiming to create paper losses or avoid taxable revenue, are under intense scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

For those caught, penalties are severe, including increased prosecution referrals for tax evasion cases, potentially leading to hefty fines, interest charges, criminal investigations, and even jail time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Who's at Risk?
*   **High Net Worth Individuals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>: A major target if using offshore tax strategies or having foreign accounts/assets that are not properly disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Businesses Involved in Complex Tax Planning Schemes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>: Especially those that artificially shift profits or exploit tax loopholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. The CRA scrutinizes transactions that appear to exist solely for tax benefits rather than genuine business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. If a tax strategy seems too good to be true, it's likely on the CRA's radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

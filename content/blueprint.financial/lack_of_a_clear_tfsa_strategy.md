One of the most frequent "silent wealth killers" observed with clients is the [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_strategies | use of a TFSA]] without a clear strategy, or by treating it like a piggy bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51">[02:51]</a>.

## Treating the TFSA as a Piggy Bank

Frequent withdrawals and redeposits can disrupt the power of compounding and potentially lead to overcontribution penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01">[03:01]</a>. While the TFSA is designed as a powerful tool for tax-free growth, it cannot fulfill this purpose if it's used as a "revolving door for cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>. Without a long-term vision, thousands of dollars in potential growth may be foregone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14">[03:14]</a>.

## Lack of Coordination with Other Accounts

Another common issue stemming from a lack of strategy is insufficient [[coordinating_tfsa_with_overall_financial_strategy | coordination with other financial accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20">[03:20]</a>.
For example:
*   Many individuals utilize their TFSA to save for a first home, potentially overlooking more suitable tools such as the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) or the enhanced Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25">[03:25]</a>.
*   There is often a lack of coordination regarding [[role_of_tfsa_in_retirement_planning | TFSA and RSP withdrawals]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34">[03:34]</a>. Most people do not have a defined plan for their TFSA in retirement, which can result in missed opportunities for tax savings and [[strategies_for_maximizing_tfsa_growth | investment growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>.

## The Importance of Intentional Goals

Individuals who succeed with their TFSA are those who establish intentional goals for its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50">[03:50]</a>. For instance, a personal goal might be to use the TFSA to fund an early retirement, which provides discipline and helps shape the strategy alongside other accounts like RSPs, FHSAs, and CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55">[03:55]</a>.

To avoid this "silent killer" and unlock the TFSA's full potential, it is recommended to consider two key questions:
1.  What is the exact purpose of my TFSA? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11">[04:11]</a>
2.  How will it integrate into my overall financial plan for the future? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>

Potential [[investment_strategies_for_tfsa | goals for a TFSA]] include:
*   Growing wealth to leave a legacy for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21">[04:21]</a>.
*   Supplementing retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25">[04:25]</a>.
*   Saving for significant life milestones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27">[04:27]</a>.

Treating the TFSA as a "fortress for your future" can help [[avoiding_tfsa_investment_pitfalls | avoid this silent killer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.

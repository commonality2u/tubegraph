The proposed capital gains tax hike in Canada, which would increase the inclusion rate of capital gains from 50% to 66.67%, was introduced in June 2024 but is now delayed until January 1st, 2026, due to significant legal and political challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These obstacles suggest the tax increase may not take effect at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Conservative Opposition

Conservative leader Pierre PV has explicitly vowed to repeal the tax if elected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He describes the tax hike as a "direct attack" on investors, [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | business owners]], and retirees, arguing it would harm investments, slow [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | business growth]], and diminish Canada's global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Election Outlook
Based on betting markets, PV's Conservative party has approximately a 95% chance of winning the next federal election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The next federal election is scheduled for October 20, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. With such strong odds, a Conservative victory is highly likely, which would make a tax reversal equally probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Liberal Party Internal Divisions

Support for the capital gains tax increase is reportedly "crumbling" within the Liberal party itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Notably, Christia Freeland, the former Finance Minister who initially introduced the change, has stated she would scrap it if she became the Liberal leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Other Liberal leadership candidates are also distancing themselves from the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Reasons for and Against Reversal

The debate over the tax hike's reversal involves key considerations:

### Arguments Against Reversal
*   **Revenue Loss:** The tax was projected to generate approximately $17 billion over five years to fund initiatives like housing, dental care, and pharmacare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Reversing it would necessitate alternative revenue sources or spending cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Tax on the Wealthy:** The Liberals have framed the tax as a means to ensure wealthier Canadians contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. A rollback could be perceived as disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### Arguments For Reversal
*   **Impact on Business Growth:** Higher capital gains taxes can discourage investments, impede [[business_owner_tax_changes_and_capital_gains_adjustments | business exits]], and limit reinvestment within Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **US Tariff Threats:** New tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Canadian imports could further incentivize businesses and investments to shift south, making an additional tax burden even less desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **High Business Costs:** Canada already faces high corporate tax rates, regulations, and labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The capital gains tax increase adds another burden for companies trying to grow, sell, or reinvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## [[potential_scenarios_and_outcomes_of_the_capital_gains_tax_hike | Potential Scenarios and Outcomes]]

The future of the capital gains tax is contingent on both legal and political developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

*   **Best-Case Scenario (Full Reversal):** This could occur through a successful judicial review that blocks the CRA from enforcing the higher inclusion rate, or if PV wins the election and fulfills his promise to return the inclusion rate to 50% for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Middle Ground (Partial Rollback or Temporary Freeze):** If PV is elected, he might lower the inclusion rate but not completely to 50%, potentially applying different rules for corporations versus individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Alternatively, a new Liberal leader might slightly reduce the inclusion rate without restoring it fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Worst-Case Scenario (No Reversal):** This would happen if legal challenges fail and the courts rule in favor of the government, allowing the CRA to collect at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It could also occur if PV wins but does not follow through on his promise due to economic pressures or competing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, or if the Liberals remain in power and keep the tax in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Given the widespread opposition, legal challenges, the deferral, and the US tariffs, there is an estimated 80% chance of a full reversal, a 5% chance of a partial rollback, and a 15% chance that the tax remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | Planning Ahead]]

While a full reversal is highly likely, investors and business owners should prepare for multiple outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Staying informed about court rulings, political shifts, and election timelines is crucial, as any reversal will likely take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Utilizing tax-efficient strategies such as maximizing TFSAs, RRSPs, and corporate structures can help reduce taxable capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Planning for various scenarios, including considering whether to sell assets like businesses or real estate now, is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

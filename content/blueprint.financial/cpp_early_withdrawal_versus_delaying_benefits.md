One significant mistake Canadians make with their Canada Pension Plan (CPP) is choosing to withdraw benefits early, often with the intention of investing the money to outperform the returns gained by delaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This approach carries substantial risks that are often overlooked.

## Risks of Early Withdrawal and Investing

While the stock market might seem like a solid alternative with historical average annual returns around 7% to 8%, market volatility is a major concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, the TSX index dropped by over 30%, taking years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. If early CPP withdrawals were invested during such a downturn, retirement income could face a severe hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Relying solely on market returns for retirement income introduces financial uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying CPP

Delaying your CPP until age 70 significantly increases your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Increased Payouts**: Delaying until age 70 increases benefits by 42% over the amount received at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For instance, a $1,000 monthly benefit at 65 would become $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Inflation Indexing**: This higher payment is indexed to inflation, which guarantees and preserves purchasing power over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Replicating this inflation-indexed growth with stock market investments is very difficult, almost impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Financial Comparison

To match the additional $420 monthly benefit achieved by delaying CPP with a private indexed annuity, one would need to invest approximately $100,000 upfront between ages 60 and 65, given current market interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Amassing such a sum is challenging for most individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. By simply [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp | delaying your CPP]], you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted income for life without needing to save that large amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Trying to outperform CPP by investing benefits early is risky and often unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. [[delaying_cpp_and_timing_benefits | Delaying CPP]] offers a predictable and secure income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Related Considerations

Strategic planning for CPP should also consider its tax implications, particularly for avoiding the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For instance, delaying CPP until age 70 could help avoid the OAS clawback for longer or minimize tax impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Ignoring tax implications can lead to a lower-than-expected retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

It's also crucial to consider the impact on a spouse or common-law partner, including pension sharing and the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_application | CPP Survivor benefit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Starting CPP early at age 60, for example, reduces monthly benefits by 36%, which in turn impacts the survivor benefit amount your spouse might receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

Additionally, don't overlook the [[cpp_postretirement_benefit | CPP postretirement benefit]] (PRB) if you continue working after starting CPP, as it can provide additional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. While PRB amounts may seem small initially, they are for life and indexed to inflation, growing over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

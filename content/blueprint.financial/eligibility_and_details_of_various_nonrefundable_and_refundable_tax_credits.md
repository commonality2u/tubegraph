The tax deadline in Canada is April 30th, and failing to claim available tax credits can result in missed savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canada offers a variety of [[tax_credits_and_benefits_available_in_canada | tax credits and benefits available in Canada]] that can significantly reduce the amount of tax owed or provide refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While some credits are automatically applied, others must be manually claimed on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Understanding these credits is crucial for [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits_in_canada | maximizing tax deductions and credits in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Non-Refundable Tax Credits

Non-refundable tax credits reduce the amount of federal tax you owe, but they cannot result in a refund if the credit amount exceeds your tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)
The BPA is a non-refundable tax credit that allows Canadians to earn a portion of income tax-free before federal income tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the BPA is $15,129 for individuals with net incomes below the 29% tax bracket threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This credit is automatically applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the age amount tax credit, a non-refundable credit designed to reduce taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, reducing taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, if net income exceeds approximately $44,000, the credit is gradually reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example, if a 66-year-old earns $42,000, they qualify for the full $9,28 age amount credit, but if they earn $46,000, the credit starts shrinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)
The CCA provides tax relief to individuals supporting a spouse, common-law partner, child, or other dependent with a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim $8,061 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For a child under 18 with a disability, an additional $2,835 can be claimed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Medical documentation may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Medical Expenses Tax Credit (METC)

You can claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_deductions | eligible medical expenses]] that exceed 3% of your net income or $2,834 (whichever is lower) for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Eligible expenses include prescription medications, dental care, vision care, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, and medical travel expenses if care isn't available locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Private loans do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Refundable Tax Credits

Refundable tax credits can result in a tax refund, even if you owe no tax, because the credit amount can be paid out to you directly.

## The Ultimate Tax Saving Combo: Stacking Multiple Credits

[[Maximizing tax deductions and credits | Maximizing tax savings]] isn't just about knowing individual credits; it's about stacking them together for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Many Canadians are unaware of how certain tax credits and deductions can work together to effectively reduce taxable income or boost refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Savings Combo
This strategy focuses on retirement tax savings by combining specific credits:
*   **Pension Income Amount:** Up to $2,000 per person for eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Age Amount Credit:** An additional tax break for those 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Pension Income Splitting:** Allows couples to shift eligible pension income into a lower tax bracket for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

> [!example] Example: John and Linda
> John has a large pension, while Linda has a smaller income. Both are over 65.
> *   They can each claim the pension income amount to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
> *   John also qualifies for the age amount credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
> *   **Stacked Savings:** Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
> *   **Bonus Tip:** Pension income splitting can save even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds, especially if they have children or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefits (CCB):** Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Allows claiming costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount:** For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Spousal RRSP Contributions:** Can reduce overall household tax liability by splitting income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

> [!example] Example: Sarah and Mike
> Sarah and Mike have two young kids in daycare, and one child has a disability.
> *   **Canada Child Benefit:** They receive tax-free monthly payments for child-related costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
> *   **Child Care Expenses Deduction:** Mike claims daycare expenses, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
> *   **Canada Caregiver Amount:** Since one child has a disability, they receive an extra tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
> *   **Stacked Savings:** CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Implications of Filing Form NR73 for Tax Residency

When [[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | leaving Canada]], many individuals consider filing Form NR73, known as the residency determination form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. People often assume this form will help confirm their non-resident status with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Unexpected Consequences of Filing Form NR73

Counterintuitively, filing Form NR73 can actually work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. When you submit this form, a CRA official will review your case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Even if you believe you have completely severed your ties to Canada, the CRA may determine that you are still a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This could result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Recommended Approach for Establishing Non-Residency

For couples, employing [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategies]] with a spouse or common-law partner can help reduce your overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This often involves strategic use of [[spousal_rsp_contributions | Spousal RSP Contributions]] and Canada Pension Plan (CPP) sharing.

## [[spousal_rsp_contributions | Spousal RSP Contributions]]

[[spousal_rsp_contributions | Spousal RSP contributions]] are a common method of [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

*   **Contribution Deadline**
    *   The general deadline for the 2024 tax year is March 3, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   An exception applies if your spouse turns 71 in the current year: the deadline for their [[spousal_rsp_contributions | spousal RSP contributions]] is December 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Attribution Rules**
    *   Be aware of attribution rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. If funds are withdrawn from a [[spousal_rsp_contributions | spousal RSP]] within three years of the contribution, the income will be attributed back to the original contributor for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### RSP Conversion at Age 71
If you turn 71 in 2024, December 31st is your final opportunity to contribute to your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) before it must be converted into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This deadline is not 60 days into the following year, unlike the general RSP contribution deadline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Missing this date means losing the last chance to contribute to your RSP ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

For all other individuals, the RSP contribution deadline for the current tax year is March 3rd of the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Early Withdrawals
> Avoid early withdrawals from your RSP unless absolutely necessary, as significant penalties can apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## CPP [[pension_income_splitting | Pension Sharing]]

[[pension_income_splitting | CPP pension sharing]] is another strategy for [[income_splitting_strategies_for_canadian_taxpayers | Canadian taxpayers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

*   **Application Timing**
    *   CPP [[pension_income_splitting | pension sharing]] becomes effective once Service Canada approves your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   It cannot be backdated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   To ensure you benefit in the upcoming year, submit your application (Form ISP 102) by the end of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

[[Income splitting strategies for tax savings | Income splitting]] is a complex but potentially highly rewarding area for managing household taxes, with some couples saving over six figures in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Think of it as a carefully choreographed dance between partners to avoid high taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Splitting CPP Income for Couples

For couples receiving [[cpp_and_income_planning | Canada Pension Plan]] (CPP) benefits, [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_payouts | income splitting]] is a straightforward method to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

*   **How it Works**
    You can shift up to 50% of [[investment_strategies_and_performance_of_cpp_investments | CPP]] benefits from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This strategy reduces the household tax bill and may help avoid the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Example: Ted and Robin's CPP Splitting Plan**
    *   Ted receives $12,000 annually in [[cpp_and_income_planning | CPP]] benefits, taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Robin receives $6,000 in [[cpp_and_income_planning | CPP]] benefits, taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   By splitting Ted's [[cpp_and_income_planning | CPP]] income, they shift $3,000 to Robin, resulting in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   **Results:** Without splitting, Ted pays more taxes due to his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. By shifting $3,000 of [[cpp_and_income_planning | CPP]] income to Robin, their overall tax bill is lowered by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Splitting Capital Losses

[[managing_capital_gains_and_losses | Capital losses]] can be transferred to a spouse to offset their [[managing_capital_gains_and_losses | capital gains]], thereby reducing the household tax bill through a mechanism called The Superficial Loss Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

*   **How it Works (The Superficial Loss Rule)**
    1.  Sell shares at a loss in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    2.  Your spouse buys the same shares within 30 days (before or after your sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
    3.  The loss is denied to you but added to your spouse's Adjusted Cost Basis (ACB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    4.  Your spouse must hold the shares for at least 30 days after the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Example: Ted and Robin's Capital Loss Splitting**
    *   Ted has a $4,000 [[managing_capital_gains_and_losses | capital loss]] from selling investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   Robin has $15,000 in [[managing_capital_gains_and_losses | capital gains]] from selling her investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   By transferring Ted's loss using the superficial loss rules, Robin's taxable gains are reduced, saving both of them taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   **Process:** Ted sells shares incurring the $4,000 loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Robin purchases the same shares within 30 days, triggering the Superficial Loss Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Ted's loss is denied but added to Robin's cost base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. When Robin sells those shares, the $4,000 loss effectively offsets her taxable gains, reducing their overall household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

*   **Pro Tip**
    *   This strategy is only effective for non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   It's crucial to maintain accurate records of your Adjusted Cost Bases (ACBs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Combining Strategies for Maximum Savings

The true power of [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | income splitting strategies]] emerges when they are combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. For example, a couple could use [[cpp_and_income_planning | pension splitting]] in retirement to balance income, in conjunction with [[investment_strategies_to_minimize_taxable_income | spousal RSP contributions]] to create more tax-deferred savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. These strategies work seamlessly together to lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

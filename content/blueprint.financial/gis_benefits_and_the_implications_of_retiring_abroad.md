The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) serves as a vital financial lifeline for many low-income seniors in Canada, potentially adding approximately $13,000 per year, tax-free, on top of Old Age Security (OAS) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## GIS Eligibility and Residency Rules

Unlike the [[cpp_benefits_for_canadians_moving_abroad | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]], which is based on contributions, or OAS, which is based on residency years, GIS has strict residency requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The crucial rule for GIS is that it is **only paid while you are living in Canada** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. If an individual leaves Canada for more than six consecutive months, their GIS payments will cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This cessation occurs even if the individual's income remains low enough to qualify and they continue to file Canadian taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### [[impact_of_retiring_outside_canada_on_canadian_benefits | Impact of Retiring Abroad]]

This particular rule disproportionately affects immigrants, many of whom plan to [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retire abroad]] back home or in a more affordable country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If GIS is a component of a retiree's income, [[portability_and_eligibility_of_gis_outside_canada | moving abroad]] could result in losing thousands of dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> For instance, Jane, a 71-year-old retiree, moved to Mexico to be closer to family and extend her pension. While her CPP continued, her GIS stopped after six months. She was unaware that leaving Canada would lead to the complete loss of this benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

There are no workarounds or international social security agreements or tax treaties that protect GIS in this situation; it is strictly tied to living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Snowbird Strategy

Some retirees employ a "snowbird strategy" to maintain their benefits. This involves staying in Canada for at least 183 days a year to keep benefits like GIS and healthcare, and then spending the remainder of the time in other countries such as Florida or Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This strategy is not suitable for everyone but can be effective with proper planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Planning for Retirement Abroad

For immigrants considering [[reasons_canadians_retire_abroad | retiring abroad]], a backup financial plan is essential, as the GIS will not follow them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

To protect yourself:
*   **Understand Residency Rules**: Be fully aware of how long you have lived in Canada and that OAS will stop if you leave for more than 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This applies to GIS as well.
*   **Build Personal Retirement Income**: Focus on RRSPs, TFSAs, and other personal savings to avoid sole reliance on government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Side income can also be beneficial if government benefits are lower than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Delay Benefits (if possible)**: Delaying CPP or OAS until age 70 can increase the monthly benefit by up to 42%, which can help mitigate lower government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Seek Professional Help**: If you have immigrated later in life or plan to retire abroad, consider seeking professional financial planning advice to navigate the different rules and create a customized strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This can include coordinating RRSP and TFSA withdrawals, planning for delayed OAS and CPP withdrawals, and being mindful of foreign exchange risk and tax implications in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

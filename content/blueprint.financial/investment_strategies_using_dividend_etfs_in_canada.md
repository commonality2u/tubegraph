*   **Ideal for:** Dividend growth investors seeking increasing payouts over time and more [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | diversified]] exposure than bank-heavy dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

### 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)
ZWC is an income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks and employs a covered call strategy to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This strategy results in higher monthly dividends but limits potential stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

*   **Covered Call Strategy:** ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks, earning premiums. While this boosts dividend yield, it caps potential gains if stock prices rise above a certain "strike price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This means ZWC trades growth potential for more stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Enhanced Income Strategy:** Uses covered calls to generate extra income, leading to a higher-than-average yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   **Monthly Distributions:** Ideal for retirees or income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   **[[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | Diversified]] Canadian Portfolio:** Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs:**
    *   **Dividend Yield:** A very high 6.62% as of February 27, 2025, due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024):** 12% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. However, its 5-year average return is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **MER:** 0.72% (higher than traditional dividend ETFs due to active options management) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   **Trading Expense Ratio (TER):** 0.20%, bringing the total cost to 0.92%, making it the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   **AUM:** $1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings:** Heavily weighted towards financials and energy, including Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. These are stable, high-yield dividend payers, but the covered call strategy caps growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Ideal for:** Retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow and those using [[Investment strategies for TFSA growth | TFSA]] or RRSP accounts who do not require long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Holding ZWC in a [[Investment strategies for TFSA growth | TFSA]] can help [[Tax saving strategies on investments in Canada | shield high dividends from taxes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Not Ideal for:** Growth-focused investors, as covered calls significantly limit potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Summary:** ZWC is a strong choice for investors seeking high monthly income with reduced market volatility. However, its covered call strategy limits upside potential, making it more suitable for pure income generation than long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### 5. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

    *   **Financials-Heavy:** Nearly 60% of the ETF comprises Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Performance and Costs:**
    *   **Dividend Yield:** Approximately 4.2% as of January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Annual Performance (2024):** 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   **MER:** 0.55% per year, considered a bit higher than some [[alternatives_to_canadian_dividend_etfs_for_investors | alternatives]] but not unreasonable for a high-yield strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   **AUM:** $1.76 billion, making it a very popular fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Top Holdings:** Dominated by Canadian financials, making up nearly 60% of the portfolio. Top holdings include Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These companies have strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Ideal for:** Retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts, and those wanting exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Not Ideal for:** Growth investors, as this fund prioritizes income over capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Summary:** XDV is a solid pick for dividend investors who desire monthly income and exposure to stable, high-yield Canadian companies. Investors should be mindful of its heavy reliance on financial stocks and moderate fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Considerations
When investing in dividend ETFs, investors can utilize the following:
*   **Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP):** Setting up a DRIP can significantly help supercharge long-term gains by automatically reinvesting dividends back into the ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Pros and Cons of Canadian Dividend ETFs

While Canadian dividend ETFs are popular, they come with certain downsides:

### Cons of Canadian Dividend ETFs
*   **Higher Fees:** Dividend ETFs often have higher-than-average Management Expense Ratios (MERs), which can erode returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. For example, XDV charges a 0.55% MER for only 31 holdings, which is considered poor [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | diversification]] for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. To mitigate this, consider lower MER dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Limited [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | Diversification]]:** Many Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. VDY, for instance, has over 85% exposure to these two sectors, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. XDV holds only 31 stocks, and XQD holds only 20, limiting broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. For true [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | diversification]], a globally [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | diversified]] ETF like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO), which holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies, might be more suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
*   **Better [[Alternatives to Canadian dividend ETFs for investors | Alternatives]] in US Dividend Stocks:** The US market offers many of the best dividend stocks, potentially providing higher dividend growth rates, more sector [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | diversification]], and more blue-chip companies with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might consider directly investing in 10-20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Another strategy is to combine a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

### Tax-Efficient Strategies
*   For US dividend stocks, consider holding them in an RRSP rather than a [[Investment strategies for TFSA growth | TFSA]] to [[Tax saving strategies on investments in Canada | avoid withholding tax on dividends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool for investors who prefer not to select individual dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. However, their higher fees, lack of [[Introduction to AllinOne ETFs in Canada | diversification]], and limited control are valid concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

The [[canada_child_benefit_explained | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB) is a key government tool introduced to reduce child poverty and support families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Child Poverty Reduction
Since its launch, the [[canada_child_benefit_explained | CCB]] has had a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. In 2021 alone, it helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. That same year, the benefit supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Broader Objectives
Beyond poverty reduction, the [[canada_child_benefit_explained | Canada Child Benefit]] also aims to address declining birth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. It does this by easing the financial burden associated with the [[cost_of_raising_a_child_in_canada | cost of raising kids]] and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

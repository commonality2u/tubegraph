The average cost of raising a child in Canada is estimated at a significant $293,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This amount is comparable to the cost of a Ferrari or a quarter of a house in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The Canada Child Benefit (CCB) can cover almost half of this expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, offering up to $125,500 per child, entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Understanding the Canada Child Benefit (CCB)

The CCB is a tax-free payment designed to assist families with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Key features of the CCB include:
*   **Indexed to Inflation**: The benefit amount increases over time to keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Completely Tax-Free**: Every dollar received is yours to keep, without deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

There are no restrictions on how CCB funds can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>; families can allocate the money for food, housing, education, or any other needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Potential Benefit Amounts

The maximum CCB payments over 18 years can be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>:

*   **For children under six**: Up to $7,778 annually, totaling $46,668 over six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   **For children aged six to 17**: An annual maximum of $6,570, accumulating to $78,840 over 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Combined, a single child can receive up to $125,500 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. There is no limit to the number of children for whom one can receive CCB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:
*   One child: Approximately $125,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Two children: Roughly $251,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Three children: A total of $376,000 over 18 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   A family with 18 children could potentially receive over $2.2 million in CCB payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For a two-parent, middle-income family, the average cost of raising a child from birth to age 17 is estimated at $293,000, or about $17,235 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Families earning over $135,000 annually spend more, averaging $403,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Families earning less than $83,000 spend about 52% less, averaging $238,000 per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

For lower-income families in Canada, the CCB could cover over 50% of the entire cost of raising a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The Canada Child Benefit acts as an umbrella, shielding families from the burden of rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Eligibility and Calculation

CCB eligibility and the amount received are based on your **Adjusted Family Net Income (AFNI)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For married or common-law relationships, AFNI combines both spouses' incomes minus certain deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. As your net income increases, your CCB decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Lower-income families receive the full benefit, while higher-income families see reduced or no payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The reduction occurs in two stages based on family net income:
1.  **Stage 1**: If your income is between $36,525 and $79,889, your CCB is reduced by 7% of any income over $36,525, with a maximum reduction of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Stage 2**: If your income is above approximately $79,000 (after the initial reduction), an additional 3.2% is deducted from any income over this $79,000 threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### CCB Reduction Example for One Child Under Six

| Family Net Income | Annual Benefit | Monthly Benefit |
| :---------------- | :------------- | :-------------- |
| $35,000 or less   | $7,777         | $649            |
| $50,000           | ~$6,840        | ~$570           |
| $100,000          | ~$2,776        | ~$231           |
| $130,000          | ~$1,814        | ~$151           |

As income increases, the annual and monthly benefit decreases, eventually phasing out completely at very high income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For exact calculations, especially with multiple children, the CRA's CCB calculator is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## How to Receive Payments

Receiving the CCB is straightforward:
*   The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) automatically calculates your payments once you file your taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. No extra application is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Ensure you and your partner file your taxes every year and your child is registered with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Filing taxes also unlocks other benefits like the GST/HST credit and the Climate Action Incentive Payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   Set up direct deposit with the CRA for faster payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   CCB payment dates are typically between the 18th and 20th of every month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Keep your information updated with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Changes in family income (e.g., job loss), life events (e.g., marriage, birth, divorce), or shared custody arrangements should be reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This could qualify you for higher payments or ensure benefits are adjusted correctly (e.g., split 50/50 in joint custody situations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

## Impact of the CCB

The CCB was introduced as a crucial tool to reduce child poverty and support families across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Since its launch, the CCB has had a significant impact:
*   It helped lift 435,000 children out of poverty in 2021 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   In 2021, it supported 1.6 million families and 2.1 million children under the age of six <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Beyond poverty reduction, the CCB also aims to address declining birth rates by easing the financial burden of raising children and encouraging families to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

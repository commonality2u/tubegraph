Canada offers numerous tax credits, making it crucial to understand which ones apply to your situation to maximize your refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Stacking Multiple Credits for Bigger Refunds
The key to maximizing tax savings is not just knowing about individual credits but combining them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Saving Combo
For retirement, combining the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income amount]] with the age amount can lead to significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The pension income amount allows a tax credit on up to $2,000 of eligible pension income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, while the age amount credit offers up to $928 federally for those 65 plus in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
For example, if John has a large pension and Linda has a smaller income, and both are over 65, they can each claim the pension income amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. John, also qualifying for the age amount credit, gets an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Stack Savings**: Pension Income Amount + Age Amount = Lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
A bonus tip is that [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | pension income splitting]] can further reduce taxes by shifting some income to a spouse in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to reduce taxes and increase their refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   **Canada Child Benefits (CCB)**: Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
For instance, Sarah and Mike, with two young children, one with a disability, can stack these credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. They receive CCB, Mike claims child care expenses, and they get the Canada Caregiver Amount for their child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Stack Savings**: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
Families can also [[using_taxfree_savings_accounts_tfsa_and_pension_income_splitting_to_minimize_oas_clawback | split income]] by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Many Canadians, especially retirees, are not fully utilizing the potential of the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite the significant advantages, a vast majority are leaving money on the table and missing out on the incredible tax-free growth potential offered by the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Underutilization of TFSA Contribution Room

Out of 17.77% of Canadians who hold a TFSA, only 1.54 million (8.66%) managed to max out their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For retirees, many enter their golden years with tens of thousands of dollars in unused TFSA contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Among Canadians aged 60 and older, only a small percentage fully [[maximizing_tfsa_for_taxfree_growth | maximize their TFSA contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For instance, while 1.56 million TFSA holders are between 60 and 64, only 9.48% of them [[maximizing_tfsa_for_taxfree_growth | maximize contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Interestingly, the percentage of maximizers increases as retirees age, reaching 18.71% for those aged 75 to 79, before dropping slightly to 14% for those aged 80 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Strategic RSP to TFSA Tactic

One key strategy to reduce taxes, boost tax-free growth, and enjoy a more comfortable retirement is the smart RSP to TFSA tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This approach can help cut tax bills, which is a common mistake retirees make by not properly [[managing_taxefficient_withdrawals_from_a_tfsa | managing their RSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### The Challenge with Excess RSP Balances

RSPs are effective for saving during working years, but all withdrawals are taxed as income, potentially pushing individuals into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Upon reaching age 71, the CRA mandates converting RSPs into RIFs and initiating mandatory withdrawals, regardless of immediate need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### The Solution: Investing Excess RIF Withdrawals in a TFSA

If there are excess funds from mandatory RIF withdrawals that are not needed for living expenses, a powerful strategy is to contribute them to a TFSA and invest them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This can save thousands of dollars in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Example: Eddie's Tax-Free Growth Plan

Consider Eddie, who is 71 and has converted his RSP to a RIF, requiring a $30,000 annual withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Being in a 30% tax bracket, $9,000 of this is owed in tax, leaving him with $21,000 after tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Eddie only needs $11,000 for living expenses, leaving $10,000 of excess RIF income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Instead of placing this excess income in a normal savings account or a taxable non-registered investment account, Eddie contributes the entire $10,000 annually into his TFSA and invests it in a portfolio of stocks and ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **TFSA Growth:** Assuming an average annual return of 6%, Eddie's TFSA grows as follows:
    *   Year 1: $10,000 contributed grows to approximately $10,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   After 10 years: With consistent $10,000 annual contributions and [[compounding_and_investment_growth_in_a_tfsa | compounding]], Eddie has contributed $100,000, and his TFSA balance grows to approximately $132,000â€”all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

*   **Comparison to Non-Registered Account:** If Eddie had invested the same $10,000 annually in a non-registered account, growing at 6% annually, 30% of the gains would be lost to taxes each year, effectively reducing his growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. After 10 years, his non-registered account would only grow to approximately $120,000 after accounting for taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. A taxable savings account earning 1% would yield even less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Key Takeaways from Eddie's Example

By contributing all his excess income into his TFSA, Eddie:
*   Saves approximately $12,000 in taxes by avoiding annual tax drag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   Grows his TFSA balance to $132,000 compared to $120,000 in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Has the flexibility to use his TFSA funds for future needs or leave them untouched to continue [[compounding_and_investment_growth_in_a_tfsa | compounding tax-free]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

> [!TIP] Prioritize your TFSA over a taxable non-registered account if you have TFSA room. Let your money grow tax-free instead of losing a chunk of your gains to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Important Considerations

This strategy does not eliminate the tax owed on RSP withdrawals, as they remain taxable income subject to your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. However, by strategically combining RSP and TFSA withdrawals, you can reduce your taxable income and potentially avoid additional penalties, such as OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The goal is to minimize tax impact while maximizing overall retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

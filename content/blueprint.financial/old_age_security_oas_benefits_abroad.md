Planning to [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | move abroad]] permanently from Canada requires careful financial management to avoid losing potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This includes understanding how your [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits are affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Understanding OAS Basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:07">[08:21:07]</a>

[[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] is based on the time you've spent in Canada and can be collected as early as age 65, with the option to delay it up to age 70 for increased benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:07">[08:21:07]</a>.

## Eligibility for [[old_age_security_oas_benefits_when_living_overseas | OAS benefits when living overseas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:03">[08:34:03]</a>

To receive [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] while living abroad, you generally must have lived in Canada for at least 20 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:03">[08:34:03]</a>.

If you don't meet this 20-year threshold, you might still qualify if you:
*   Worked abroad for a Canadian company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:07">[08:43:07]</a>.
*   Lived in a country that has a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:06">[08:47:06]</a>. A full list of these countries is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:09">[08:49:09]</a>.

It's important to note that years spent in countries with social security agreements do not count towards the actual [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] benefit amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:02">[08:54:02]</a>.

## Benefit Amount and Additional Benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:04">[08:59:04]</a>

If you meet the [[rules_and_considerations_for_retaining_canadian_benefits_while_living_abroad | requirements]] for [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]], the benefit amount remains the same regardless of where you live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:04">[08:59:04]</a>.

However, additional [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] benefits such as the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Survivor Allowance require you to reside in Canada to receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:06">[09:09:06]</a>. [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | Moving abroad]] will disqualify you from receiving these additional allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:03">[09:21:03]</a>.

*   **[[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] Clawback:** High-income earners may face the [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] clawback (recovery tax) on earnings over a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. This clawback still applies when living abroad, unless you move to a country with a tax treaty with Canada that allows you to bypass it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. Non-residents typically must file a T136 form annually to determine any required repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:06">[09:42:06]</a>.
*   **Withholding Tax:** Countries without a tax treaty with Canada may impose a withholding tax on [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] payments, typically around 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:08">[09:49:08]</a>. For example, if you [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | move]] to the US, there will be no withholding tax on your [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] due to the tax treaty between Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:07">[09:56:07]</a>. Always check the specific tax treaty details for your planned country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **Annual Tax Return:** To collect [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] abroad, you must file an annual tax return reporting your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

## Pro Tip for [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] Income Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>

If you're at risk of the [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] clawback, consider managing your income through strategic withdrawals from other retirement accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Additionally, you might consider deferring [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | OAS]] payments up to age 72 to increase your monthly benefit by 0.6% for each month deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

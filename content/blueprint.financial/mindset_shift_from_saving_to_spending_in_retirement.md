Upon entering retirement, many individuals face a significant [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save or spend dilemma]] and struggle with a fundamental [[strategies_for_balancing_spending_and_saving_in_retirement | mindset shift]] from decades of saving to a period of spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This transition can feel uncomfortable and unnatural, as retirees often find it difficult to move from a "scarcity mindset" to an "abundance mindset" where they feel confident utilizing their accumulated wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This hesitation is a common challenge observed among almost all clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Why Not Spending Enough Can Be Detrimental

While caution might seem prudent, there are several reasons [[impact_of_not_spending_enough_in_retirement | why not spending enough in retirement can be a bad thing]]:

*   **Missed Experiences and Opportunities** Retirees who are hesitant to spend may miss out on fulfilling experiences like travel, hobbies, or even healthcare improvements that could enrich their "Golden Years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These are the moments that make retirement enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Healthspan vs. Lifespan** Dr. Peter Attia's concept of "healthspan" distinguishes the years lived in good health—active, independent, and free from chronic disease—from "lifespan" (total years lived) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Delaying spending can mean missing the best years of one's healthspan, as physical abilities may decline later, limiting enjoyment of what was saved for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_inflation_on_retirement_savings | Inflation's Impact]]** Inflation steadily erodes the purchasing power of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This concern is significant if a retirement plan is not properly structured to account for inflation, which a well-planned retirement should do to preserve purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Benefits of Cautious Spending

Conversely, not spending all accumulated wealth can also have positive implications:

*   **Encourages Cautious Spending** A hesitation to spend can promote thoughtful and deliberate financial decisions, preventing impulse purchases or overspending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Extends Longevity of Funds** This careful approach helps money last longer, reducing the "longevity risk" of running out of funds prematurely, a common concern for most retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Reduces Portfolio Risk** Cautious spending helps protect against "sequence of returns risk," where market losses early in retirement can significantly deplete a portfolio faster than later losses, even if markets recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Aligns with Legacy Goals** For many, a key goal is to leave a substantial amount for loved ones or charitable causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Being cautious with spending allows retirees to achieve these legacy goals while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Therefore, while not spending enough can have downsides, it also serves as a protective measure, enhancing financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Finding the Right Balance

The key to navigating the [[save_or_spend_dilemma_for_retirees | save versus spend dilemma]] is finding a healthy balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. A primary challenge for retirees is often not knowing how much they can safely spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Due to the complexity of variables and factors, it's natural to err on the side of caution to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. However, this cautious approach can lead to not enjoying the wealth accumulated over a lifetime of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It's often possible to achieve all financial goals and spend more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

A [[financial_planning_for_retirees | well-structured financial plan]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. By clearly outlining affordable spending limits and stress-testing the investment portfolio, financial planning helps retirees shift from a mindset of fear and caution to one of confidence and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Michael and Karen: Spending More Freely

Michael (66) and Karen (64) are a couple who overcame the save vs. spend dilemma to enjoy their retirement more fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Profile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>:
    *   **Combined Income**: $180,000 annually from pensions (CPP, OAS, work pensions) and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   **Annual Expenses**: $70,000 covering basic living costs, travel, and discretionary spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   **Savings**: $4 million in a [[diversifying_retirement_income | diversified portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   **Goal**: Increase spending on luxury travel, home renovations, and charitable giving, but unsure how much more they could spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>: Despite their $180,000 income significantly exceeding their $70,000 expenses, leaving a $110,000 surplus, they were hesitant to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Analysis showed their $4 million portfolio, with a sustainable 3.5% withdrawal rate, could provide an additional $140,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Their guaranteed income streams covered basic expenses, leaving investments largely untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Solution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>: Their portfolio was stress-tested for poor market conditions, including a 30% decline in value in early years, and it remained safe for long-term sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Longevity projections to age 95 showed the portfolio would last well beyond their predicted lifetimes, even with higher spending <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>: Armed with this information, Michael and Karen gained confidence to spend more freely. They booked luxury vacations, began home renovations, and increased charitable contributions, enjoying retirement without jeopardizing their financial future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Robert and Susan: Balancing Lifestyle and Legacy

Robert (70) and Susan (68) sought to balance their desire to enjoy retirement with leaving a meaningful inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

*   **Profile** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>:
    *   **Combined Income**: $100,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   **Annual Expenses**: $75,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   **Savings**: $1.2 million in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   **Goal**: Leave a meaningful inheritance for their children and grandchildren while still enjoying their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>: Robert and Susan were cautious with spending, despite a healthy income and savings, unsure if they could afford more travel and leisure while preserving enough for family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Analysis revealed their $1.2 million portfolio, with a 4% withdrawal rate, could provide $48,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Combined with their $100,000 income, they had more than enough to cover $75,000 in expenses with flexibility for increased spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Solution** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>: To balance lifestyle and legacy, a slight increase in annual spending from $75,000 to $85,000 was recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This allowed for more travel and experiences while maintaining their inheritance goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Stress testing for potential market downturns confirmed they could comfortably maintain this spending without jeopardizing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Outcome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>: With the new spending plan, Robert and Susan gained confidence to enjoy a higher quality of life now while still leaving a meaningful inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach helped them strike the right balance between current enjoyment and long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

> The larger a client's portfolio, the harder it can be to convince them to spend more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This is often due to the strict savings habits developed to accumulate such wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you have built a large portfolio, consider easing into spending by setting small, meaningful goals like short trips or new hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Gradually shifting your mindset can help you enjoy your retirement more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

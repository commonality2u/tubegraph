Deciding when to start your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits can significantly impact your retirement income and tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Estimating your income and expenses between ages 60 and 69 can help determine the most tax-efficient timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## How Delaying Benefits Impacts Income and Taxes

[[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying CPP and OAS payments]] until age 70 substantially increases your monthly payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. CPP grows by 8.4% per year after age 65, and OAS grows by 7.2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This higher income is often worth the wait, especially if you have other sources of income to cover early retirement expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Example: John's Strategy

Consider John, who could start CPP and OAS at age 65, receiving $1,500 per month or $18,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, since he plans to continue working part-time and sell property between ages 65 and 69, adding CPP and OAS would push him into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. It would also subject him to the [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks | OAS clawback]], a 15% recovery tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Instead, John chooses to delay his benefits until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. By doing so, his CPP and OAS combined income increases to $2,125 per month or $25,500 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This decision not only gains John an extra $7,500 annually but also keeps his [[tax_implications_of_cpp | tax bill]] lower during his early retirement years (ages 65-69) by maintaining a lower marginal tax rate and [[strategies_to_avoid_oas_clawback | avoiding OAS clawbacks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This approach offers both higher guaranteed income and significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## When Starting Early May Be Better

While [[strategies_for_maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | delaying benefits]] can be beneficial, it isn't always the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Consider starting CPP or OAS sooner if:
*   **Health Concerns**: If you have a shorter life expectancy, taking early benefits may be more practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Immediate Income Needs**: If other income sources are limited, starting CPP at 60 or 65 provides needed stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

When leaving Canada, it is crucial to properly establish non-residency for tax purposes to avoid continued tax obligations on worldwide income. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) closely monitors Canadians departing the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding Tax Residency Status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>
Canada taxes individuals based on [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency status]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. If you do not clearly establish your non-residency, you could still be considered a Canadian tax resident and owe taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

There are four main types of [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency status]] to consider when moving:
*   **Factual Resident**: Someone who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties, even if temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Emigrant**: An individual who leaves Canada permanently and severs significant residential ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The CRA considers an individual an emigrant for tax purposes if they leave Canada and establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **[[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Non-Resident]]**: An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Non-residents]] do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but can be taxed on [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Canadian income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Deemed [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Non-Resident]]**: Occurs when you qualify as a tax resident in another country with a [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]] with Canada, meaning Canada won't tax you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

> If you spend more than 183 days in the US during a calendar year, you could be classified as a US tax resident and be subject to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Tracking your days with apps like Day Count or TaxBird is crucial to avoid crossing this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Addressing Departure Tax (Exit Tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
When leaving Canada, you may be subject to a departure tax, which treats certain assets as if they were sold at fair market value on the day you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This can trigger capital gains tax even if no actual sale occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

**Assets Subject to Departure Tax**:
*   Stocks, ETFs, and other investments in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Private company shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
*   Foreign real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>

**Assets Not Subject to Departure Tax**:
*   Canadian real estate owned personally (taxable only when sold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>
*   Registered accounts like [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions_and_withdrawals_for_nonresidents | RRSPs]] and TFSAs (though you cannot contribute after leaving) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>

Paying any applicable exit tax through a departure tax return is a key action to prove non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Avoiding Form NR73 (Residency Determination Form) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
Many mistakenly believe that filing Form NR73 will help confirm their non-resident status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, this form can work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. A CRA official reviewing your case might determine you are still a Canadian tax resident, leading to continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

**What to do instead**:
*   **Skip Form NR73**: It is not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **File a departure tax return**: Report your departure date and pay any applicable exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Let your actions prove non-residency**: Actively sever significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Checking [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | Tax Treaties]] and Tie-Breaker Rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>
When relocating, understanding how [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] affect your [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency status]] is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Some countries have [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] with Canada that include tie-breaker rules to determine residency when both countries can claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

[[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | Tax treaties]] typically use the following criteria to resolve dual residency:
1.  **Permanent Home**: Where you have a permanent place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
2.  **Center of Vital Interests**: Where your personal and economic ties are strongest (family, employment, social connections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  **Habitual Abode**: In which country you habitually reside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
4.  **Physical Presence (183-day Rule)**: Some countries automatically consider you tax present if you spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

For example, the Canada-US [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]] can resolve dual residency situations even if you meet the US substantial presence test (183 days or more in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If your permanent residence and center of vital interest are still in Canada, you may be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Severing Significant Ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>
The CRA assesses your residential ties to determine if you remain a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Failing to properly sever these ties can result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

**Primary Residential Ties (Strongest Indicators)**:
*   **Home in Canada**: Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada**: If they remain, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada**: Children or other dependents living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

**Secondary Residential Ties (May Influence Status)**:
*   **Personal property**: Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Social ties**: Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Economic ties**: Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Canadian documentation**: Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Mailing address**: Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

> [!caution] Multiple Ties
> While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can keep you classified as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

**Actions to Sever Residential Ties and Confirm Non-Residency**:
*   **Sell or rent out your Canadian home**: Leasing to unrelated parties demonstrates you have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Move your family abroad**: Bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Close or convert Canadian financial accounts**: Terminate accounts or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Update government records**: Change your address, cancel health coverage, and surrender your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Planning for Tax on [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Canadian Income]] After Leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
Even after departing Canada, certain [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Canadian income]] sources may remain taxable for [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | non-residents]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Understanding these obligations is important to avoid unexpected liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

**Types of Taxable [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Canadian Income]] for [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Non-Residents]]**:
*   **CPP and [[oas_eligibility_and_taxes_when_retiring_overseas | OAS]] pensions**: Generally subject to a 25% withholding tax, though [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] can reduce this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Rental income from Canadian property**: Typically subject to a 25% withholding tax on the *gross* rental amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **[[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions_and_withdrawals_for_nonresidents | RRSP]] withdrawals**: Generally subject to a 25% withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

**Strategies to Reduce Withholding Tax**:
*   **File Form NR5**: [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | Non-residents]] can apply for a lower withholding tax rate on certain income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. If approved, taxes are withheld at a reduced rate based on expected Canadian tax liability for up to 5 years, requiring an annual Canadian tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **Elect under Section 216 for rental income**: Allows [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | non-residents]] to pay tax on *net* rental income (gross minus expenses) instead of the 25% gross withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This often results in lower tax liability and allows deductions for property-related expenses, requiring an annual Section 216 tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **[[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | Tax treaty]] considerations**: Check if your new country has a [[tax_treaties_and_their_impact_on_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]] with Canada that automatically lowers your withholding tax rates for pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. For example, moving to the US may result in lower CPP, [[oas_eligibility_and_taxes_when_retiring_overseas | OAS]], and [[registered_retirement_savings_plan_rrsp_contributions_and_withdraw]] RRSP withholding tax rates than the standard 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## Establishing Residency in a New Country Properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>
Failing to secure legal residency in another country can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. If you leave Canada without official [[understanding_canadian_tax_residency_status_when_relocating | tax residency status]] somewhere else, you may remain liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

**Steps to Properly Establish Residency Elsewhere**:
*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency**: Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Set up Financial Ties**: Open a bank account, rent or buy a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Obtain an ID Card and Register for Health Insurance**: In your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in your New Country**: Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a [[tax_implications_on_canadian_income_for_nonresidents | non-resident]] for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

Leaving Canada requires careful planning to avoid unnecessary taxes or double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. [[tax_implications_and_nonresident_status | Tax law]] becomes exponentially harder when two tax systems are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

Many Canadians anticipate that the [[Canadian Pension Plan CPP basics and start age options | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits will be sufficient for their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, for those who rely heavily on these benefits, life can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While it's technically possible to survive on this income, it often necessitates significant sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The [[Canadian Pension Plan CPP basics and start age options | Canada Pension Plan]] is structured based on an individual's lifetime earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Higher contributions made during working years generally lead to a larger payout in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, most individuals do not receive the maximum amount, as it requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

CPP is designed to replace approximately 25% to 33% of an individual's working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### CPP Payouts (2025 Estimates)

Delaying the start of CPP payments significantly impacts the monthly amount received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Waiting until age 70 can boost benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

*   **Starting at Age 60** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 65** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Starting at Age 70** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:
    *   Average monthly payment: Approximately $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
    *   Maximum monthly payment: Approximately $2,034 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

## Old Age Security (OAS) Pension

The Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a universal benefit available to Canadians aged 65 and older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. To qualify, individuals must have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not tied to employment income or work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, the amount received can vary based on residency, overall income, and whether payments are deferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (in January, April, July, and October) and adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. An automatic 10% increase is applied to the OAS pension at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### OAS Maximum Monthly Payments (March 2025 Estimates)

*   **Ages 65 to 74**: $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   **Age 75 and Older**: $800 (a 10% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

For seniors with very low total income, the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) may be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This government benefit is designed to support low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

*   **Maximum GIS (2024)**: $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Income Impact**: GIS is reduced dollar-for-dollar if other income is received, even small withdrawals from RRSPs can affect eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **OAS Exclusion**: OAS payments do not count towards the GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Total Estimated Income from CPP, OAS, and GIS

If an individual has no other sources of income, their total monthly retirement income might be approximately $2,000, combining an estimated $800 from CPP, $700 from OAS, and $500 from GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

However, $2,000 per month is barely above the poverty line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, indicating that relying solely on CPP, OAS, and GIS is not a comfortable retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## [[Reliability of CPP and OAS for retirement in Canada | Is it Enough for Retirement?]]

For most people, relying solely on CPP and OAS is not enough for a comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. While technically possible, it typically requires significant sacrifices and a "barebones lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Cost of Living Breakdown (Monthly Estimates)

Key expenses that would consume a significant portion of a $1,500-$2,000 monthly income include:

*   **Housing**:
    *   **Homeowners**: Even with a paid-off mortgage, property taxes, maintenance, and utilities can cost $500 or more per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Renters**: Minimum rent in smaller cities is about $1,000 per month, which could immediately consume over half of the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Rents in major cities like Toronto or Vancouver often exceed $2,000 for a one-bedroom apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: A basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month, making frequent dining out difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Costs**: Prescription medications, dental care, and vision care can be major expenses, especially if private insurance is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: Costs for electricity, heating, internet, and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership (insurance, gas, maintenance) can add $200-$500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, while public transit can cost at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations

Relying solely on these benefits often means:

*   **No Travel Budget**: Even domestic trips would require significant saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **No Big Purchases**: Items like furniture, appliances, or a new car are unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Limited Emergency Fund**: Living month-to-month means unexpected bills can derail finances, potentially requiring reliance on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### When it Could Work

Living on CPP and OAS alone can be possible in specific circumstances:

*   **Owning a Home Outright**: Eliminates mortgage or rent payments, significantly reducing expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners might also consider borrowing against their home or downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Living in a Very Low-Cost Area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch a budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Having Extra Support**: Help from family, a small investment income, or a part-time job can make a significant difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a mortgage-free retiree in small-town Ontario with minimal expenses might make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When it Falls Apart

For most retirees, relying solely on CPP and OAS is insufficient due to:

*   **Major City Costs of Living**: Difficult to survive on this income in urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **No Savings**: Lack of emergency funds means every month is a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Most Canadians prefer not to spend their retirement constantly worrying about finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Strategies if CPP and OAS are Insufficient

If CPP and OAS benefits do not cover expenses, several strategies can help bridge the gap:

*   **Delay CPP and OAS**: Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP can grow by 42% by delaying to age 70, and OAS by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Part-Time Work or Delay Retirement**: Working longer or taking on part-time work can ensure finances last throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**:
    *   **Downsizing**: For homeowners, this frees up capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   **Relocating**: Moving to a lower-cost area in Canada or even abroad can make money go further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Utilize Government Benefits**: Explore other programs like the Allowance for the Survivor for additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **[[Tax planning for retirement in Canada | Tax Planning]]**: Strategies such as [[Pension income splitting in Canada | pension income splitting]], pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower your [[Tax implications of CPP | tax burden]] and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Creative Retirement Strategies

Some retirees find innovative ways to manage with limited income:

*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming house sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **Monetizing Hobbies**: Earning income from skills like teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or working as a part-time tour guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Programs like TrustedHousesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend involves slow travel through low-cost countries, utilizing extended tourist visas to live for months in places where pensions stretch further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal can offer a higher quality of life for the same income, though healthcare access is a consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Many retirees engaging in this lifestyle are in their 60s or early 70s, still active and healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

If relying solely on CPP and OAS, a backup plan is crucial, and early [[Retirement planning strategies in Canada | planning]] provides more options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

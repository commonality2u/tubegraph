Non-registered accounts serve as the final destination for investments after maximizing contributions to registered accounts like the FHSA, TFSA, and RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While these accounts lack the inherent tax advantages of registered accounts, it is still possible to grow wealth wisely within them by focusing on tax-efficient investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Ideal Assets for Non-Registered Accounts

To minimize taxes in non-registered accounts, specific investment types are recommended over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Focus On:

*   **Growth Stocks with No Dividends**
    *   These are ideal because capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than interest income and only when the assets are sold, allowing for tax deferral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
    *   Examples include Shopify, Nvidia, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   *Caution*: Due diligence is advised before investing in higher-risk growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Canadian Dividend Stocks**
    *   These investments allow investors to take advantage of the Canadian dividend tax credit, which significantly lowers taxes on eligible dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   For example, a $1,000 dividend is grossed up to $1,380, resulting in a 15% federal tax credit that reduces taxes by $27, with further provincial credits also helping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Avoid:

*   **Interest Income**
    *   This type of income is taxed at the highest possible rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **US Dividend-Paying Stocks**
    *   These stocks face withholding taxes and do not qualify for the Canadian dividend tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

[[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying your CPP]] start age can significantly increase your monthly payouts. While delaying inherently boosts individual benefits, it's important to note that it doesn't automatically move an individual from an average payout to the absolute maximum possible payout, which is also influenced by other factors such as contributions and average earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Increased Payouts with Age

Delaying the start of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) pension beyond the standard age of 65 results in substantially higher monthly benefits. For 2024, if you delay until age 70:
*   The average monthly amount is $1,159 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The maximum monthly amount is $1,937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

In comparison, starting at age 60 significantly reduces benefits, with an average of $522 and a maximum of $873 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. At the standard age of 65, the average monthly amount for a new retirement pension in April 2024 was $816.52, and the maximum was $1,364.60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## General Recommendation

As a general guideline, for most individuals, it is advisable to [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delay your CPP]] as long as possible, even if you are not working at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Comparison with Early Withdrawal

One common misconception is that [[early_cpp_withdrawal_risks | starting CPP early]] at age 60 can help avoid penalties for having no income between ages 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. However, the reduction incurred by [[early_cpp_withdrawal_risks | starting CPP early]] is generally much more significant than the impact of a few years with low or no income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

Deciding [[optimal_age_to_start_cpp_payments | when to start CPP]] is a distinct financial consideration covered in more detail separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Stacking Multiple Credits for Bigger Refunds

Maximizing tax savings often involves combining multiple tax credits and deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Saving Combo
Retirees can combine credits for significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. For example, the Pension Income Amount (up to $2,000 per person) combined with the Age Amount Credit (worth up to $1,354 federally in 2025 for those 65+) can lead to lower taxes and a bigger refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Pension income splitting can further enhance these savings by shifting income to a spouse in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine several credits to reduce taxes and increase refunds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>:
*   **[[canada_child_benefit_program | Canada Child Benefit]] (CCB)**: Tax-free monthly payments for parents with children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Child Care Expenses Deduction**: Claim costs for daycare, babysitting, or after-school programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Canada Caregiver Amount**: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Combining these can result in thousands of dollars in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Families can also split income by contributing to a spouse's Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

In Canada, mortgage interest is generally not tax deductible, unlike in some other countries such as the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. However, a legal strategy exists to convert mortgage interest into a deductible investment loan over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This is achieved by re-borrowing against home equity and investing the funds in income-generating assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

This strategy works because the [[cra_tax_benefits_overview | CRA]] allows interest deductions on loans used for investments, but not on mortgages for personal residences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. By recycling mortgage payments into an investment loan, homeowners can take advantage of a legal "gap" in the tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## How the Strategy Works

The process involves several steps repeated over time:
1.  **Make regular mortgage payments** A portion of each monthly mortgage payment reduces the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
2.  **Reborrow the principal reduction** If you have a readvanceable mortgage, the amount paid towards the principal becomes available in a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
3.  **Invest borrowed money** The funds from the HELOC are used to purchase income-generating investments, such as dividend stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
4.  **Claim [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | tax deduction]] on HELOC interest** Since the borrowed money is used for investments, the interest paid on the HELOC becomes tax deductible, reducing your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
5.  **Repeat the process** By repeating this monthly, your mortgage can gradually be converted into a tax-deductible investment loan, while your investment portfolio grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Example Scenario

Consider David, who has a $500,000 mortgage and makes a monthly payment of $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   Suppose $800 of his payment goes towards the principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   This $800 becomes available in his HELOC, which he then borrows and invests in dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Over time, by consistently re-borrowing and investing monthly, David converts his entire mortgage into an investment loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   The interest on the HELOC is now tax deductible, reducing his taxable income annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   David simultaneously invests and reduces his [[tips_to_legally_reduce_tax_liabilities | tax bill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Risks and Downsides

While this strategy sounds appealing, it comes with significant risks and requires strict discipline:

> [!caution] Key Risks
> *   **Interest Rate Risk** HELOCs typically have variable interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. If rates rise, borrowing costs increase, making the strategy less attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
> *   **Market Volatility** If investments underperform or lose money, you are still obligated to pay interest on the HELOC, even if your portfolio value drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For instance, if David's portfolio earns 10% he benefits, but if it loses 20%, he still owes HELOC interest, potentially putting him in a dangerous financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
> *   **Discipline Required** To maintain the [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | tax deduction]], the HELOC money must be consistently reinvested and used *only* for income-generating investments, not personal expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Failure to do so can lead to loss of the deduction and serious financial and tax issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
> *   **[[cra_tax_benefits_overview | CRA]] Scrutiny** The [[cra_tax_benefits_overview | CRA]] requires that borrowed money generates income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. If investments do not generate income (e.g., a growth stock with no dividends), the [[maximizing_tax_deductions_and_credits | tax deduction]] could be denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Effectiveness and Caution

This strategy is most effective in a low interest rate environment where the cost of borrowing is low compared to potential investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. With interest rates in Canada starting to decline, it may become more attractive in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

However, this is not a strategy for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. It requires a high level of comfort with leverage and investment risk, as well as strict financial discipline to execute successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Tax laws can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. It is crucial to check the latest [[cra_tax_benefits_overview | CRA]] rules before making any significant financial moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Consulting with a tax professional is highly recommended to ensure compliance and maximize potential [[tips_to_legally_reduce_tax_liabilities | tax savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

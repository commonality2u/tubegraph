Relying too much on the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) as a main source of retirement income is a significant mistake that can lead to financial struggles in later life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04">[09:04]</a>.

## Why CPP Alone Isn't Enough
While CPP is designed to replace approximately one-third or 33% of an average worker's pre-retirement earnings, this is often insufficient to maintain a comfortable standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>. For instance, if an individual earned $40,000 annually before retirement, their CPP benefit would be around $13,200 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25">[09:25]</a>. This amount typically does not cover all expenses, especially with rising costs for healthcare, housing, and daily living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38">[09:38]</a>.

Furthermore, CPP payments are considered taxable income, which can significantly impact an individual's overall tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27">[00:27]</a>. This taxable nature can further reduce the net income received from CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44">[09:44]</a>. In some cases, higher total income due to CPP could even lead to an [[reliability_of_cpp_and_oas_for_retirement_in_canada | OAS clawback]], where parts of Old Age Security (OAS) benefits are reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05">[01:05]</a>.

Relying solely on CPP might force retirees to cut back on their lifestyle or deplete their personal savings more quickly than planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48">[09:48]</a>.

## Building a Comprehensive Retirement Plan
To ensure a comfortable retirement, it is crucial to have multiple sources of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57">[09:57]</a>. These can include:
*   Personal savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01">[10:01]</a>
*   Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01">[10:01]</a>
*   Other pension plans, such as RRSPs or TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04">[10:04]</a>

CPP should be viewed as only one component of a broader retirement strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07">[10:07]</a>. While the [[sustainability_of_cpp_over_the_long_term | CPP is financially sustainable]] for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05">[08:05]</a>, its primary purpose is to provide a baseline income, not to fully replace pre-retirement earnings.

Delaying CPP can increase monthly benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47">[02:47]</a>, but this is a strategy to maximize one component, not a replacement for a diverse income portfolio. For example, [[benefits_of_delaying_cpp_past_age_60 | delaying CPP]] until age 70 can boost benefits by 42% over the age 65 amount, and these higher payments are indexed to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50">[02:50]</a>. However, even with these increases, CPP typically remains a part of a larger financial picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20">[10:20]</a>.

Financial planning should focus on a well-rounded approach that considers all potential income streams to meet future needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13">[10:13]</a>.

Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most impactful retirement choices Canadians can make, yet it's often more complex than it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin receiving CPP at or before age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, for many, waiting until age 70 can potentially add over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Thinking of your CPP decision as part of a retirement jigsaw puzzle, various pieces like [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]], investment returns, and income streams must fit together to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## CPP Basics: Understanding the Options

Most Canadians claim CPP at age 60, with over 70% starting their benefits at either 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, there are options to start at any age between 60 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting Early (Age 60):** Choosing to start CPP at 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, if Sarah qualifies for $1,000 per month at 65, she'd receive $640 per month at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Delaying (Age 70):** Waiting until 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Using Sarah's example, her monthly payments would jump to $1,420 per month at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Your actual CPP payments will likely differ from these examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. For a detailed estimate of your own CPP payments, other resources are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Key Takeaways from an Actuarial CPP Report

A 2020 Actuarial study on CPP take-up decisions provides valuable insights into optimal timing, considering probabilities, life expectancies, and expected investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 60

This option is best for those who:
*   **Need Immediate Income:** Those who require immediate funds or have [[Impact of health on CPP timing decisions | health concerns]] leading to a shorter [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Can Achieve High Investment Returns:** If your investment funds can consistently achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking CPP at 60 allows you to invest the payments and potentially come out ahead, though at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Consider GIS and OAS:** Starting at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid clawbacks on Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

It comes with permanent drawbacks, including a 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65, significantly impacting long-term income, especially for those who live beyond age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario (John):** A 60-year-old with health issues and very little savings decides to take CPP early to secure income and avoid GIS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Starting CPP at 65

This default option strikes a balance, providing steady payments and avoiding the need for savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income:** Offers reliable, inflation-adjusted income without requiring additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Average Longevity:** Suitable for retirees with below-average to average [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]] and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis:** Payments equalize with the 70-option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those unsure of longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

However, it leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario (Maria):** A 65-year-old retiring with modest RSP savings and average health decides to take CPP now to maintain predictable income without depleting her savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to 70

Delaying CPP provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, increasing payments by the maximum amount, which is also inflation-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Longevity Protection:** Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return:** Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to around 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Ideal for Longer Life Expectancies:** This option is ideal for those with longer [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age:** For most, delaying CPP becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments start to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **Example Scenario (Susan):** A 70-year-old who expects to live well into her late 80s or 90s, with sufficient RSP funds, decides to delay CPP to maximize her lifetime inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Estimating Your Life Expectancy

Your predicted investment returns and [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]] are crucial [[Factors affecting CPP payouts | factors affecting CPP payouts]] when deciding when to take CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Insights from Data

*   **Gender Differences:** Women tend to live longer than men; 82% of women are likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Delaying CPP is especially beneficial for women seeking secure, inflation-protected income in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle and Family History:** A healthy lifestyle or a family history of long life increases your odds of longevity (79% for men, 85% for women to live past 80), making delayed CPP a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Longer Than Expected:** Even with low longevity expectations, the majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Stats Canada Data:** Recent data shows that the older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes. For instance, a 50-year-old man can expect to live until about 82, while a woman can expect to live nearly to 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   **Key Takeaways:** [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | Life expectancy]] in Canada is generally longer than most people realize (beyond 80-82 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Women benefit more from delaying CPP due to their longer lifespans, often reaching their late 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Men should balance longevity with their current health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Tools for Estimation

*   **Online Life Expectancy Calculators:** Several online calculators can provide estimates based on factors like age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass:** Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity. It's quick (5 minutes) and offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

    *   *Note:* Results from these calculators can vary, so use them as a guide rather than a definitive answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Methods to Refine Estimates:**
    *   **Genetic Testing:** Uncovers potential health predispositions and longevity factors based on DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
    *   **Lifestyle Evaluations:** Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
    *   **Biological Age Testing:** Advanced tests that measure aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate of true biological age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   **Comprehensive Health Screenings:** Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, which significantly impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Using a CPP Present Value Calculator

While a CPP break-even table is a good starting point, it doesn't consider the investment rate of return or the present value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. A CPP present value calculator incorporates these [[Factors affecting CPP payouts | factors affecting CPP payouts]] for a more accurate estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

One such calculator, available on TaxTips, allows you to input several variables:
*   **Estimated Monthly Benefit at Age 65:** Your anticipated CPP payment at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Estimated Annual Indexation of CPP (Inflation Rate):** The expected rate at which CPP payments will be adjusted for inflation (e.g., 2.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This variable can significantly impact the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
*   **Start Ages for CPP Evaluation:** You can compare different start ages, typically 60, 65, and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Calculate Present Value (PV) of Cash Flows Up to Including Age:** This is where you input your estimated [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   *Example:* For a woman in her 50s, an average life expectancy of 86 could be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   If you live to 100, delaying to 70 significantly outperforms starting at 60 (e.g., $320,000 present value vs. $222,000 for age 60 at a 2% rate of return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
    *   If you pass away early (e.g., 72), starting at 60 would likely have been the best option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Rate of Return:** An estimated rate of return for your investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
    *   A higher rate of return can close the gap between the present values of starting at 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. For example, at a 6% return, age 65 and 70 become very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

The calculator provides a "present value" result, which accounts for the time value of money, offering a more nuanced comparison than cumulative amounts alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Comprehensive CPP Planning Considerations

Deciding when to start CPP is a complex puzzle, and a careful approach can help maximize lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Beyond individual [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]] and investment returns, comprehensive planning often includes:
*   **Scenario Analysis:** Running various scenarios for [[Life Expectancy and Longevity Planning for CPP | life expectancy]] and break-even points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Tax Strategies:** Analyzing how CPP income interacts with your overall tax situation to potentially reduce or increase your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation:** Determining if [[Impact of delaying CPP collection | delaying CPP collection]] can help avoid or reduce the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Holistic Income Coordination:** Integrating CPP with other retirement income sources like Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSP) withdrawals and Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA) to create the most efficient retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

While there are exceptions, professional analysis often reveals [[Benefits of delaying CPP past 60 | benefits of delaying CPP past 60]] into the late 60s or even 70s for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

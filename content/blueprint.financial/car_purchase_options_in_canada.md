The used car market experienced a significant surge, jumping 40% higher during the pandemic, but prices have since stabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. When considering your next vehicle, there isn't a universal answer to whether you should buy, lease, or finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Using an Online Calculator

A useful online calculator can help guide your decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The Bankrate.com calculator is recommended for its ease of use and applicability to various cars, whether you are in America, Canada, or elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Key Inputs for the Calculator

To get accurate figures, it's best to obtain quotes for financing and leasing directly from a dealership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. If not possible, company websites can provide initial information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The following inputs are crucial for the calculator:

*   **Vehicle Price**: For an example, a Ford F-150 was used with a price of $49,955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Down Payment**: Can be set to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sales Tax Rate**: Varies by location; 5% was used in the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Investment Rate of Return**: This represents the opportunity cost of investing your money elsewhere instead of purchasing the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A higher rate makes buying less appealing compared to leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Conservative investors: 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
    *   Middle-of-the-road: 5-6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
    *   Aggressive portfolio: 7% and above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>
    *   The example used 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Custom APR (Annual Percentage Rate)**: The interest rate for financing. A low rate like 1.99% may not always be available depending on your credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Fees**: Other associated costs, such as $2,495 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Depreciation Rate**: This is a critical and influential number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   New cars typically lose about 20% of their value in the first year and 15% annually for the next four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   Online tools like Edmunds and Kelly Blue Book can estimate depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
    *   Checking current marketplaces (e.g., AutoTrader, Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, Kijiji) provides real-time insight into a car's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   The example used an estimated 15% annual depreciation over 48 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Lease Residual Percent**: The estimated value of the car at the end of the lease term, typically between 40% to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This value is provided by the dealership and is generally non-negotiable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The example used 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Example Outcome

Using the Ford F-150 example, with the specified inputs, the net cost of buying was $34,380, and the net cost of leasing was $35,371 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This shows they can be very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

The investment rate of return and annual depreciation rate significantly impact the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. For instance, a 10% investment rate of return can make buying worse than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Conversely, a lower annual depreciation (e.g., 10%) can make buying substantially cheaper than leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. The market resale value, influenced by supply and demand, is difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Key Takeaways: Financial Considerations

*   **High Resale Value**: If a vehicle has a high resale value, buying or financing is generally cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Low Resale Value**: If a vehicle has a low resale value, leasing becomes more cost-effective, especially if it can be written off for business purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Cost**: When buying outright or making a large down payment, consider the opportunity cost of what that money could have earned if invested elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Estimates**: All financial calculations are estimates, as future resale values and investment earnings are uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The car market is unpredictable; for example, those who leased in 2017 missed out on profiting from soaring used car prices during the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

## Non-Financial Considerations

Since market prediction is nearly impossible, non-financial factors often outweigh purely financial ones when deciding to buy or lease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

*   **Ownership Preference**:
    *   **Buy**: Ideal for long-term ownership and customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: Suitable if you prefer new models every few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Tax Write-offs (for business owners)**:
    *   **Lease**: Offers deductible payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
    *   **Buy**: Allows for depreciation and interest deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Debt Aversion**:
    *   **Lease**: May feel less burdensome due to lower payments without long-term debt, but without building equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. However, lease payments can be generally higher than financing payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**:
    *   **Buy**: Offers freedom to sell at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: Locks you into a term but may include conveniences like warranty coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Plans**:
    *   **Buy**: If you intend to keep your car for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: If you prefer frequent vehicle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Environmental or Emotional Factors**:
    *   **Buy**: May support sustainability more and fosters attachment to the vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: Provides access to the latest eco-friendly models with higher turnover, but may not feel as personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Maintenance**:
    *   **Buy**: You cover maintenance costs post-warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
    *   **Lease**: Often includes maintenance during the lease term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Insurance Costs**: Leased vehicles can potentially require higher insurance, increasing overall costs compared to buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **End-of-Lease Options**: Leasing provides the flexibility to buy the car at the end of the term if you decide to commit to a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Buying Used

Buying a used car is often the financially smartest choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. New cars can depreciate significantly, losing up to 20% of their value in the first year and 50% within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

By purchasing cars that are typically 3 to 5 years old, you can avoid the initial depreciation hit and get more value for your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. At this age, cars are generally not old enough to have major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Used cars also usually have lower insurance costs and less financial burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. With research, you can find a reliable, well-priced used car that meets your needs, often with comparable or better features than a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

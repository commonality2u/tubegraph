The traditional notion of retiring at 65, common when house prices were low and life expectancy was shorter, is no longer the norm in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Today, Canadians can expect to live 30 or more years in retirement, leading to concerns about outliving savings without proper planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Consequently, an increasing number of Canadians are working past 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Canadians Retiring Later

[[changing_retirement_age_in_canada | Canadians are retiring later]] than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   In 1997, the average retirement age was 60.9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   By 2010, it increased to 62.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   By 2020, it reached 64.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   In 2024, the average retirement age has climbed to 65.3, the highest in nearly half a century, representing a four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   The median retirement age is now over 65, indicating that more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Approximately 12% worked by choice to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Another 9% worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   This suggests that over half of retirees working past 65 do so by choice, indicating a [[mindset_and_cultural_expectations_for_early_retirement | rethinking of what retirement looks like]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Retirement Age by Sector
*   Public sector employees tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Private sector workers retire around 65 and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Self-employed Canadians often work the longest, retiring on average at nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Reasons Canadians are Working Longer and Retiring Later

Several factors contribute to the shift in retirement trends:

### Longer Life Expectancy
Canadians are [[longer_life_expectancy_and_its_impact_on_retirement | living longer than in the past]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy is not fixed; it increases as one ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   At age 40, the average Canadian man expects to live to 78, and women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   At age 50, men are projected to live to 79, and women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   At age 60, men are looking at about an 80.5-year life expectancy, and women at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   At age 70, men reach about an 83.2-year life expectancy, and women at 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
If healthy at 65, individuals likely have two or more decades ahead, transforming retirement from a 10-year plan to a 20 to 30-year lifestyle that requires more funding and health management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Pension Coverage Changes
For many years, Canadians relied on defined benefit pensions, offering a predictable, employer-backed income for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, this type of pension is now less common, particularly in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Private sector workers are more likely to have defined contribution plans, where retirement income depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Only 37.5% of paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning most Canadians must self-fund retirement through RRSPs, TFSAs, or other savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. As a result, retirement has become more "DIY" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without a matching boost in income, contributing to [[factors_contributing_to_falling_retiree_incomes | falling retiree incomes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Shelter Costs:** Up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Renters are squeezed, and homeowners face significant rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Groceries:** Food prices have increased over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise, impacting fixed incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** While Canada has public healthcare, out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
Making ends meet is harder, especially for those renting, carrying debt, or supporting family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Taxes also reduce disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Work Has Become Less Physical
Historically, physical demands often dictated retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, more Canadians now work in knowledge-based or service jobs that are less physically demanding, such as sitting at a desk or working on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job is not physically taxing and an individual remains mentally sharp, there's less incentive to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Many older individuals feel energized by work, finding it provides structure, keeps their brain active, and offers financial rewards with fewer physical costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Changing Views on Retirement
A generational [[mindset_and_cultural_expectations_for_early_retirement | mindset shift]] is occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. For boomers and Gen Xers, retirement is less about "escape" and more about "freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This freedom might involve working part-time, consulting, freelancing, or starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Retirement is increasingly seen as a "ramp" rather than a "cliff," a slow transition to something more flexible and personally fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection, which many retirees miss when they stop entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" is impacting retirement timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The rising number of Canadians over 50 getting divorced often leads to a significant financial reset, requiring asset division, legal fees, and supporting two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Even a solid couple's retirement plan may be insufficient for an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Starting over often entails new expenses like mortgages or rent, with fewer years to rebuild savings. This often forces individuals to delay retirement, downsize, or re-enter the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Uncertainty and Peace of Mind
Uncertainty is a major factor in delaying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Volatile markets and unpredictable housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   Inflation, while improved, is still higher than many retirees plan for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   Rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tension contribute to general anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
Many Canadians delay retirement not out of necessity, but because they don't feel financially secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. They prioritize "peace of mind" over a specific "magic number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Relying on fixed incomes (CPP, OAS, savings) feels riskier due to potential market dips, medical emergencies, or rent hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This leads people to work longer, delay tapping into savings, and build larger buffers, even if not strictly necessary, for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## The Value of Time in Retirement
While delaying retirement can build a larger financial buffer, time is the most valuable asset in retirement, becoming more valuable the less one has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Therefore, retiring as early as safely possible allows individuals to buy back time and enjoy more healthy years, living rather than just surviving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Retirement Planning Scenarios: Keanu's Case Study

Let's examine how strategic planning can significantly impact retirement outcomes, using the example of "Keanu," a 65-year-old single individual aiming for a modest lifestyle spending $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Keanu earned $90,000 annually before retirement and has $400,000 in an RRSP and $100,000 in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. His home is paid off, but he has no corporate pension, and CPP and OAS are assumed to start at 65 unless otherwise noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Retiring Cold Turkey at 65
If Keanu retires immediately at 65, collecting CPP and OAS right away, and living off savings, he runs out of money by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His RRSP depletes quickly, and his TFSA cannot cover the remaining expenses, leading to a negative net worth in his mid-80s, assuming no major health or inflation surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This illustrates that $500,000 in savings, while substantial, may not be enough for 25+ years of retirement without a solid [[retirement_planning_strategies_to_navigate_pension_changes | plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Working Three More Years
If Keanu works three more years, earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save, while still taking CPP and OAS at 65, his money easily lasts through age 90, with a net estate of over $400,000 remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Just three extra years of work provide over a decade of financial breathing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Working Two More Years and Delaying CPP
In this version, Keanu works only two more years but waits until age 70 to start CPP, aiming for a much higher monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. However, this strategy still results in a shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. He aggressively draws from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69 to bridge the gap, which drains it too quickly, leaving less in his later years despite stronger CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This shows that delaying CPP is powerful, but without a smart [[understanding_retirement_income_sources_and_withdrawals | withdrawal strategy]], it can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Strategic Withdrawals and Delayed CPP
The most effective approach for Keanu involves retiring at 67 and delaying CPP to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Crucially, he draws gradually from his RRSP between ages 67 and 69, just enough to cover his needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This strategy results in a steady income throughout retirement, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate of over $500,000 remaining by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This combination of working two years, delaying CPP, and strategically managing RRSP withdrawals provides the necessary financial balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

These scenarios, though simplified, demonstrate the power of proper sequencing of payments and withdrawals in [[retirement_planning_strategies_to_navigate_pension_changes | retirement planning strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Keanu did not need to double his savings or work until 70; by tweaking factors like CPP timing, smart withdrawals, and working slightly longer, he built a workable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

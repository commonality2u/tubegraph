The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is a government payment that can reach up to $948 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. However, this entire amount can be clawed back by the government if an individual's income exceeds a certain threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This mechanism is officially known as the "recovery tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## How the OAS Clawback Works

The [[strategies_to_avoid_oas_clawback | OAS clawback]] activates when an individual's net income surpasses a specific threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For the 2024 income year, this threshold is $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A recovery tax of 15% is applied to the amount of income exceeding this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

If an individual's income reaches or exceeds specific higher thresholds, the entire OAS benefit can be lost:
*   For those under 75, if annual income reaches or exceeds $153,700, all OAS benefits are clawed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   For those age 75 and over, the full clawback occurs at an annual income of $153,700, or specifically at $9,481 annually (the maximum OAS payment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Example of OAS Clawback

Consider David, a 75-year-old in Canada collecting OAS in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. His income is $160,000, which is well above the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
The 15% recovery tax on the amount over the $90,997 threshold totals $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Since David's maximum annual OAS benefit of $9,481 is less than this recovery tax, he loses all of his OAS benefits for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks | Strategies to Avoid or Reduce the OAS Clawback]]

There are several effective strategies to reduce or eliminate the OAS clawback, potentially saving over $9,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### 1. [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying CPP Payments]]

One of the most effective strategies is to delay [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] payments until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This increases CPP payments by up to 42% and lowers taxable income between the ages of 65 and 70, when the OAS clawback typically applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Example**: If eligible for $1,000 per month in CPP at age 65, delaying until age 70 increases monthly payments to $1,420 (a 42% increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These higher, inflation-indexed payments continue for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Case Study (Peter Parker)**: Peter faced an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income from drawing both CPP and other retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. By delaying CPP, his taxable income was reduced, resulting in a smaller OAS clawback of $584 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This represented a savings of over $2,000 on the OAS clawback, in addition to securing higher CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying OAS Payments]]

Consider [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying OAS payments]] up to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: This increases monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It provides more income later while potentially reducing or eliminating the clawback in earlier retirement years when income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Example**: Receiving $500 per month in OAS at age 65 would increase to $680 per month if delayed until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Case Study (Peter Parker)**: Peter's $811 clawback at age 65 was eliminated by delaying OAS until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This strategy is smart when expecting higher income between ages 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Important Note**: Delaying CPP and OAS is not always advisable, especially for individuals with health issues or a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Personal circumstances require specific planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### 3. Using Your TFSA Wisely

A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a valuable tool for avoiding the OAS clawback because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Benefit**: You can use TFSA funds for living expenses without increasing your taxable income, helping you stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Example**: Withdrawing $20,000 annually from a $100,000 TFSA for living expenses incurs no taxes and does not count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In contrast, withdrawing the same amount from a taxable account like an RRSP could trigger the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: The TFSA offers flexibility to access tax-free income and protect OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **Pro Tip (RRSP to TFSA Ladder)**: Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This keeps taxable income lower later and allows for tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement, minimizing the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting

Pension income splitting can significantly reduce taxable income and help avoid the OAS clawback, especially when one spouse earns much less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Up to 50% of eligible pension income can be transferred to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Example (Peter Parker and Mary Jane)**: Peter earns $60,000 annually from his pension, while Mary Jane earns less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. By transferring $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane, Peter's taxable income drops from $60,000 to $30,000, putting him in a lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Mary Jane is taxed on the $30,000 at her lower bracket, resulting in less overall tax for the couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This strategy helps keep Peter's income below the OAS clawback threshold of $90,997, preserving his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### 5. Managing RIF Withdrawals

When an RRSP converts to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RIF) at age 71, minimum annual withdrawals become mandatory and are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These withdrawals can push income over the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: One way to minimize impact is to use a younger spouse's age to reduce the required RIF withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Example (Peter and Mary Jane)**: Peter (71) and Mary Jane (65) can use Mary Jane's younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Instead of Peter's 5.28% withdrawal rate at age 71, basing it on Mary's age reduces the rate to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. For a $200,000 RIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering taxable income by $2,560 and helping stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### 6. Investing Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts

The type of income generated from non-registered investment accounts can significantly affect taxable income and trigger the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Income Types and Taxability**:
    *   **Interest income** (from bonds, GICs, savings accounts) is fully taxable at your marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   **Capital gains** are only taxed at 50% of your marginal tax rate (if under the $250,000 threshold) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends, you can reduce your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Example**: $10,000 in interest income is fully taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, $10,000 in capital gains from growth stocks only has $5,000 counted as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Being mindful of investment income types is crucial to avoid exceeding the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### 7. Capturing Capital Gains Before Age 65

Timing capital gains is key to [[strategies for minimizing pension clawbacks | avoiding the OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Realizing significant capital gains before turning 65 can prevent large taxable events once OAS payments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. While capital gains are taxed favorably, large gains can still push income over the clawback threshold in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Approach**: Consider realizing these gains between ages 60 and 64, before receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This allows taxes to be paid earlier and avoids increasing taxable income during critical retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Example**: Selling property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain doesn't count towards taxable income when OAS begins, keeping you under the clawback threshold and saving thousands in reduced benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Effective retirement planning involves understanding how strategies like [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying CPP and OAS]], utilizing TFSAs, and managing RIF withdrawals can help avoid the OAS clawback and preserve more benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. These smart financial moves can potentially save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. For complex cases, such as those with retirement properties or businesses, professional financial planning can be invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

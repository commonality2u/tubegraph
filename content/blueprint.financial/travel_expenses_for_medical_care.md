## Example: Jennifer's Medical Travel Claim

Consider Jennifer, who earns $55,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. She must travel 100 km round trip for weekly medical treatments over a period of three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Her expenses include:
*   Gas and parking: $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>
*   Meals and accommodations: $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>
*   **Total Travel Expenses: $2,300** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>

To [[calculating_eligible_medical_expense_claims | calculate her eligible claim]]:
1.  Determine 3% of her net income: $55,000 * 3% = $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
2.  Subtract this amount from her total expenses: $2,300 - $1,650 = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Jennifer can claim $650 of medical travel expenses on her tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Pro Tips for Maximizing Claims

*   **Accompanying Persons**: If a medical practitioner certifies that you require assistance while traveling for medical care, you can also claim the travel costs for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Record Keeping**: Always keep detailed records of your trips, including receipts for all expenses and confirmations of medical appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is crucial for supporting your claim if requested by the CRA.

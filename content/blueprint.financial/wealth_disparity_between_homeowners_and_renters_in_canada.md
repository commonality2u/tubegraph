Data from 2024 reveals a significant wealth gap between homeowners and renters in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>. This disparity is so striking that one analyst expressed shock, noting they knew there would be a difference, but not over $1 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

## The Growing Wealth Gap

In 2024, homeowners in Canada had an average net worth of $1.38 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This figure is nearly five times higher than that of renters, whose average net worth was $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Both groups experienced steady growth in net worth from 2020 to 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>:
*   Homeowners saw a 33% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   Renters experienced a 31% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Key Drivers of Disparity

The primary factor driving this considerable gap is [[impact_of_real_estate_on_canadian_net_worth | real estate appreciation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Real estate significantly boosts the net worth of homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. For context, real estate makes up over 50% of the average Canadian household net worth, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. This highlights the strong reliance Canadians have on property for wealth building and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

In contrast, renters have little exposure to real estate and primarily build wealth through financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Implications and Strategies

Such heavy reliance on real estate means that any downturn in the housing market could severely impact households, potentially wiping out a large portion of net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Relying too heavily on a single asset class increases risk, especially in a volatile market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Consider spreading investments across real estate, stocks, bonds, and other assets to protect against potential downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

For those aiming to build wealth and [[financial_planning_and_tax_advantages_for_home_ownership_in_canada | leverage real estate]], working towards homeownership is a significant goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. However, it's also important to optimize financial assets using vehicles like RRSPs, TFSAs, and other investment options, as these are key drivers of long-term wealth accumulation for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

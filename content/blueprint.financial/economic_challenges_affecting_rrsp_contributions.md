Canadians' ability to save for retirement has been significantly impacted by various economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. These challenges include inflation, rising interest rates, and the general rising cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Overview of the Impact

While many Canadians were able to increase their savings during the pandemic, the elevated RRSP levels observed in 2021 and 2022 were largely temporary spikes caused by specific pandemic-related savings habits, where people cut expenses and contributed more to their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The subsequent decline in average RRSP account values in 2023 reflects a return to more normal savings levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Despite the continued focus on financial futures, the rising cost of living and inflation are making it much harder to maintain higher contribution levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

For individuals in their midlife, such as those aged 35 to 54, balancing mortgages, family expenses, and careers often makes it difficult to prioritize [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | retirement contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Specific Economic Concerns

Surveys highlight the widespread concern among Canadians regarding these economic pressures:
*   In 2023, 74% of Canadians expressed concerns about how inflation and rising prices were affecting their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   By 2024, 63% of Canadians reported that current economic conditions were negatively impacting their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Canadians' Resilience

Despite these significant economic challenges, Canadians continue to prioritize their [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP contributions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The average contribution to RRSPs grew to $651 in 2023, up from $575 in 2022, demonstrating a steady focus on retirement savings amidst economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This trend showcases the resilience of Canadians, who, despite economic turbulence, remain focused on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Regular [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP contributions]] are considered essential for long-term financial security, even during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

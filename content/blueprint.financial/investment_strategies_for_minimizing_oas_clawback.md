The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is a government payment that can provide up to $948 annually directly into an individual's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. However, this amount can be significantly reduced or [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | clawed back]] by the government if an individual's income exceeds certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. The [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]], also known as the recovery tax, begins when income surpasses $86,995 for the 2024 income year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. If income reaches or exceeds $153,700 annually for those under age 75, or $9,481 annually for those age 75 and over, the entire OAS benefit can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. This happens due to a 15% recovery tax applied to the income over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

For example, if David, a 75-year-old, has an income of $160,000 in 2024, which is well over the clawback threshold, he would lose all his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The recovery tax on the amount over the $86,995 threshold would add up to $10,300, exceeding his annual OAS benefit of $9,481, resulting in zero payment for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

To [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks_with_rrif_withdrawals | avoid]] or reduce this [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | clawback]], several investment strategies can be employed.

## Using TFSA Wisely
A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is one of the most effective tools to help [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks_with_rrif_withdrawals | avoid the OAS clawback]] because withdrawals from a TFSA are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This allows individuals to access funds for living expenses without increasing their taxable income, helping them stay below the [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

For instance, if you have $100,000 in your TFSA and withdraw $20,000 annually for living expenses, this amount is not taxed and does not count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This strategy is particularly useful if your taxable income is already close to the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. If the same $20,000 were withdrawn from a taxable account like an RRSP, it could push your income over the threshold, triggering the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. The TFSA offers flexibility to access tax-free income and protect OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] RSP to TFSA Ladder
> Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing it to your TFSA before age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This keeps your taxable income lower later on and allows tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement, minimizing the clawback effect on your OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.

## Managing RRIF Withdrawals
Upon turning 71, your RRSP converts into a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF), and you must begin making minimum annual withdrawals, which are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. These withdrawals can push your income over the [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | OAS clawback threshold]] if not managed carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

One clever way to minimize this impact is by using a younger spouse's age to reduce the withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. For example, if Peter is 71 and his wife Mary Jane is 65, they can base Peter's RRIF withdrawal on Mary Jane's younger age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. Normally, at age 71, Peter would need to withdraw 5.28% from his RRIF. However, by basing it on Mary Jane's age, the rate drops to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. For a $200,000 RRIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering their taxable income by $2,560 and helping them stay below the [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

## Investing Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts
The type of income generated from non-registered accounts can significantly impact your taxable income and potentially trigger the [[understanding_oas_clawback_and_recovery_tax | OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

*   **Interest Income:** Fully taxable at your marginal rate (e.g., from bonds, GICs, savings accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend Income:** Taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Capital Gains:** Only 50% of the gain is taxed at your marginal tax rate if you stay under the $250,000 threshold, making them a more tax-efficient option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

By focusing on growth investments like stocks that primarily generate capital gains instead of interest or dividends, you can reduce your taxable income and stay below the [[oas_updates_and_clawback_thresholds | OAS clawback threshold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. For example, if your portfolio generates $10,000 in interest income, the full amount is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. However, if you invest in growth stocks that generate mostly capital gains, only $5,000 of a $10,000 gain would be taxable, counting towards your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

## Capturing Capital Gains Before Age 65
Timing is crucial when managing capital gains to [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks_with_rrif_withdrawals | avoid the OAS clawback]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. By realizing significant capital gains before you turn 65, you can avoid large taxable events once OAS payments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. While capital gains are taxed more favorably, large gains can still push your income over the clawback threshold in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

A smart approach is to potentially realize these gains between the ages of 60 and 64, before you start receiving OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>. This allows you to pay taxes earlier and avoid increasing your taxable income during retirement years when OAS is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>. For example, selling a property or investments for a $50,000 gain at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain won't count towards your taxable income during the crucial years when OAS begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. This strategy helps keep you under the clawback threshold and can save thousands in reduced benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning
When it comes to retirement planning, being aware of strategies like [[strategies_to delay_cpp_and_oas_for_higher_benefits | delaying CPP and OAS]], [[using_tfsa_to_reduce_taxable_income_and_prevent_oas_clawback | using your TFSA]], and [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks_with_rrif_withdrawals | managing RRIF withdrawals]] can help you [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks_with_rrif_withdrawals | avoid the OAS clawback]] and keep more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. These smart financial moves can potentially save tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

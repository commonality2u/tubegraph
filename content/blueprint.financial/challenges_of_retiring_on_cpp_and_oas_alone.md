Many Canadians mistakenly believe that the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) benefits will be sufficient for their retirement years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, retirees who rely heavily on these benefits often find it challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down expected payouts, examines what life on these benefits truly entails, and helps determine if you're on track for financial freedom or in for a wake-up call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Understanding CPP and OAS Benefits in Canada

For most Canadians, [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | retirement income]] comes from multiple sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. However, relying solely on CPP and OAS can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

The Canada Pension Plan is based on your lifetime earnings; the more you contributed during your working years, the higher your payout in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Most people don't receive the maximum amount as it requires decades of consistent maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Here's an overview of estimated monthly CPP payouts in 2025:
*   **Starting at age 60**:
    *   Average: Approximately $517 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
    *   Maximum: About $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>
*   **Starting at age 65**:
    *   Average: Approximately $888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   Maximum: $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>
*   **Starting at age 70**:
    *   Average: $1,147 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
    *   Maximum: Approximately $2,304 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>

**Key Takeaway**: Taking CPP early significantly reduces your monthly payment, while waiting until age 70 can boost benefits by over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, you need to be able to afford delaying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. CPP is designed to replace only about 25% to 33% of your working income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Old Age Security (OAS)

The OAS pension is a universal benefit for Canadians aged 65 and older who have lived in Canada for at least 10 years after turning 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Unlike CPP, OAS is not based on employment income and is available regardless of work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The amount received can vary based on residency income and deferral choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Maximum monthly OAS payments as of March 2025 are:
*   Ages 65 to 74: $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Ages 75 and older: Jumps by 10% to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>

OAS payments are reviewed quarterly (January, April, July, October) and adjusted for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. There is an automatic 10% increase at age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

If your total income is very low, you may qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), a government benefit designed to help very low-income seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The maximum GIS for 2024 is $900 per month for single seniors with no other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. GIS is reduced dollar for dollar by any additional income, meaning even small [[challenges_with_rrsp_withdrawals_in_retirement | RRSP withdrawals]] can impact eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Total Estimated Income (No Other Sources)

If you have no other income sources, your total monthly retirement income might look like this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   CPP: ~$800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
*   OAS: ~$700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   GIS: ~$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Total**: ~$2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

Note that OAS does not count toward the GIS income calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. While living on about $2,000 per month is possible if you qualify for GIS, it's barely above the poverty line, making it far from a comfortable plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Cost of Living Breakdown on CPP/OAS Alone

What does retirement on $1,500 to $2,000 per month actually look like in Canada? While technically possible to survive, it requires serious sacrifices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Major Expenses

Your money would primarily go towards these essential costs:
*   **Housing**: This is the biggest cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   If you own your home outright, you still budget for property taxes, maintenance, and utilities, potentially $500 or more per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   If you rent, even in smaller cities, a minimum of $1,000 per month is common, wiping out over half your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Rents in major cities like Toronto or Vancouver easily exceed $2,000 per month for a one-bedroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Food and Groceries**: With rising prices, a basic grocery budget for a single senior is around $300 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Eating out often is typically out of the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: If you're under 65 and not covered by a provincial plan, private insurance may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Prescription medications, dental, and vision care can be major expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Transportation**: This includes electricity, heating, internet, and phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Car ownership (insurance, gas, maintenance) can add $200 to $500 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Relying on public transit costs at least $100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Lifestyle Limitations

Living on these benefits means significant limitations:
*   **No Travel Budget**: Even domestic trips require serious saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **No Big Purchases**: Furniture, appliances, or a new car are likely not happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Emergency Fund**: You're likely living month-to-month, so unexpected bills can derail everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This often means relying on family, food banks, or community support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

> [!info] The Big Takeaway
> You can survive, but it's a barebones lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If your goal is to enjoy your golden years, this will be very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Reality Check: Is it Enough?

The short answer is: for most people, no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### When It *Could* Work

Living on CPP and OAS alone is challenging but might be possible under specific circumstances:
*   **Owning Your Home Outright**: No mortgage or rent drastically lowers expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Homeowners can also borrow against their home or downsize to free up cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Living in a Very Low-Cost Area**: Small towns or rural parts of Canada offer more affordable living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Sharing Housing Costs**: Living with roommates, family, or housemates can stretch your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. [[financial_challenges_of_retiring_alone | Retiring alone]] often exacerbates housing cost challenges.
*   **Having Extra Support**: Help from family, investment income, or a part-time job makes a huge difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

For example, a retiree in small-town Ontario, mortgage-free and with minimal expenses, could potentially make $2,000 per month work with very strict budgeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### When It *Falls Apart*

For most retirees, surviving on CPP and OAS alone simply doesn't add up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>:
*   **Major City Costs of Living**: Extremely difficult for someone on this income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Expenses**: Medical bills, car repairs, or home maintenance can quickly derail finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **No Savings**: Without emergency funds, every month is a financial balancing act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Most Canadians do not want to spend their retirement worrying about every dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Strategies to Bridge the Gap

If CPP and OAS won't cover your expenses, you're not alone, and there are ways to bridge the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | Common retirement planning strategies in Canada]] often involve a combination of these approaches.

*   **Delay CPP and OAS**: Payments increase the longer you wait, up to age 70. CPP grows by 42% and OAS by 36% by delaying to age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Part-Time Work/Delaying Retirement**: Working longer or picking up part-time work can ensure your money lasts throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Lower Housing Costs**: Downsizing frees up capital for homeowners, while relocating to a lower-cost area in Canada or even abroad makes your money go farther <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Take Advantage of Government Benefits**: Programs like the Allowance for the Survivor can provide additional financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This relates to [[understanding_cpp_and_oas_benefits_in_canada | understanding CPP and OAS benefits in Canada]].
*   **Tax Planning**: Income splitting, pension sharing, and RRIF withdrawal strategies can lower your tax burden and increase after-tax income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This is part of [[pension_and_retiree_tax_changes_including_cpp_and_oas | pension and retiree tax changes including CPP and OAS]].

## Creative Ways to Make It Work

Some retirees on CPP and OAS with limited income are thinking outside the box:
*   **House Hacking**: Renting out part of their home, offering short-term Airbnb stays, or becoming house-sitters to live rent-free while traveling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Hobbies into Income**: Monetizing skills like teaching music, selling crafts online, tutoring, or becoming part-time tour guides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Work-for-Stay Arrangements**: Programs like Trusted Housesitters allow retirees to live for free by house-sitting around the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Nomadic Retirement**: A growing trend for retirees to slow travel through low-cost countries, taking advantage of extended tourist visas and living for months where their pension stretches further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The speaker has met retirees living on about $1,500 a month in Mexico, spending $600 on rent and eating out daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **Relocating Abroad**: Countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Portugal offer a higher quality of life for the same income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. However, healthcare access can be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Most retirees pursuing this are in their 60s or early 70s, active and healthy enough to embrace the lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

The harsh truth is that if you're relying only on CPP and OAS, you need a backup plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The sooner you plan, the more options you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Retirement income planning and CPP]] is like a medical checkup: the earlier you diagnose a problem, the more options you have to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. If you're still working, now is the time to put a plan in place to avoid relying solely on CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

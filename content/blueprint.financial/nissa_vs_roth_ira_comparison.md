The Japan Nissa account and the USA Roth IRA competed in a semi-final matchup to determine which tax-free savings vehicle would advance to the championship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:10">[02:35:10]</a>.

## Key Comparison Points

### Contribution Limits

*   **Nissa**: The revamped Nissa offers two contribution pathways:
    *   Up to 2.4 million yen per year for the Growth Nissa, equivalent to approximately $23,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:35">[02:47:35]</a>.
    *   1.2 million yen per year for the Sumitate Nissa, which is about $11,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:40">[02:57:40]</a>. Even the lower Sumitate amount surpasses the Roth IRA's limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:22">[03:03:22]</a>. The Growth Nissa is described as a "powerhouse" for those looking to invest more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:35">[03:11:35]</a>.
*   **Roth IRA**: Allows a contribution of $7,000 USD, which is roughly $9,500 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:40">[03:05:40]</a>.

**Winner**: Japan's Nissa for higher contribution limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:60">[03:14:60]</a>.

### Flexibility

*   **Nissa**: Allows tax-free withdrawal of funds at any time with no age restrictions from either Nissa account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:15">[03:19:15]</a>. However, withdrawn amounts cannot be recontributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:45">[03:23:45]</a>.
*   **Roth IRA**: Has rules concerning the withdrawal of early earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:45">[03:28:45]</a>.

**Winner**: Japan's Nissa for greater freedom to access funds without penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:45">[03:31:45]</a>.

### Lifetime Limit

*   **Roth IRA**: Features a growing lifetime contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10">[03:35:10]</a>.
*   **Nissa**: The new Nissa increased its lifetime cap to approximately 18 million yen, which is about $174,000 Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>. Despite being an improvement, this cap still limits its long-term growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:10">[03:49:10]</a>.

**Winner**: USA's Roth IRA for its uncapped, growing lifetime contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:20">[03:53:20]</a>.

### Simplicity

*   **Roth IRA**: Generally considered easier to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:10">[03:57:10]</a>.
*   **Nissa**: Can be "tricky for new investors" due to its two account types, lifetime tracking, and overlapping rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

**Winner**: USA's Roth IRA for its relative simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:30">[04:10:30]</a>.

## Match Outcome

The initial score was tied 2-2 at the end of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:15">[04:14:15]</a>. In overtime, the Roth IRA's unlimited lifetime contribution space proved decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. While Japan's Nissa put up a strong fight with higher annual limits and greater flexibility, its lower lifetime cap ultimately limited its long-term advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

The final score was 3-2, with the USA's Roth IRA winning in overtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The Roth IRA advanced to the final championship match against Canada's TFSA, which is detailed in the [[tfsa_vs_roth_ira_championship|TFSA vs Roth IRA Championship]] comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

The average Canadian's RRSP balance saw a significant drop of over $30,000 between 2022 and 2023, declining to $113,000 from $144,000, which reflects a return to more typical savings levels after temporary spikes during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While Canadians remain focused on their financial futures, rising costs and inflation are making it challenging to maintain higher contribution levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

When examining retirement savings by age, it's crucial to look at median data rather than averages, as averages can be heavily skewed by high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The median offers a more realistic snapshot of what most Canadians have saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The most recent median data, sourced from Statistics Canada's 2019 information, combines RRSP, RIF, and LRA data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## RRSP Holdings by Age Group (Median vs. Average)

### Under 35
Younger Canadians, those under 35, have a median RRSP saving of just $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This indicates that many young adults have minimal savings for retirement, underscoring the importance of starting consistent saving as early as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Age 35-54 (Midlife)
In the 35 to 54 age group, savings show some improvement, but the median balance of $30,000 to $70,000 is still considered far below what is typically required for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Individuals in this stage often face challenges in prioritizing retirement contributions due to juggling mortgages, family expenses, and careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Age 55-64 (Nearing Retirement)
For those aged 55 to 64, the median savings increase to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While some individuals are in better financial shape, with an average of over $216,000, for many, this amount may not be sufficient to sustain a comfortable retirement, necessitating reliance on additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Age 65+ (Retirees)
In the 65 and older age group, there's a significant disparity between median and average savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The median savings remain at $100,000, while the average is $224,000, indicating that the average is skewed by a small number of high-income outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This implies that many retirees will heavily depend on government benefits like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) or other income streams, as private savings alone may not cover all expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Contribution Patterns by Age

Despite inflation and rising costs, Canadians are prioritizing their RRSP contributions, with the average contribution growing to $6,651 in 2023, up from $5,750 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Contributions vary significantly by age group:
*   **Age 55 and above:** This group contributes a median of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This reflects a clear prioritization of savings as Canadians approach retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Age 15 to 24:** Younger Canadians contribute a median of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. While lower than older groups, this still indicates a surprising focus on early-stage retirement saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Savings Across Age Groups

### Economic Challenges
Economic challenges, including inflation and rising interest rates, significantly impact Canadians' ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In 2023, 74% of Canadians expressed concerns about inflation's effect on their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. By 2024, 63% reported that current economic conditions negatively affected their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Despite these difficulties, Canadians continue to focus on their long-term retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Household Size
[[comparison_of_average_canadian_net_worth_by_age_group | Household size]] also impacts contributions, with larger households typically contributing more due to higher combined incomes and shared financial responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. For example, two-person households had a median contribution of $4,888, while single-person households contributed significantly less overall, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This highlights that dual-income households are generally better positioned to save more for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

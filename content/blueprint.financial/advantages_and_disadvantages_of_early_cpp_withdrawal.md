Taking Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits early, such as at age 60, is a common consideration for many Canadians, but it comes with significant financial implications that can impact overall retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While there might be a temptation to access funds sooner, it's crucial to understand the associated drawbacks, particularly concerning taxation, investment risks, and spousal benefits.

## Perceived Advantage: Investing Early Withdrawals

One tempting idea is to take CPP benefits early, for instance at age 60, and invest the money in hopes of outperforming the returns gained by [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying CPP collection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The stock market, with its historical average annual returns of around 7% to 8%, might appear to be a solid alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Disadvantages of Early CPP Withdrawal

### 1. Significant Tax Implications

CPP payments are considered taxable income, which can significantly affect your overall tax situation in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Higher Tax Brackets**: Taking CPP early can push an individual into a higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. For example, if a retiree earning $90,000 annually adds $10,000 from CPP, their total income of $100,000 might trigger a higher provincial tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback**: Early CPP collection can cause Old Age Security (OAS) benefits to be reduced through a clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If total income exceeds a certain threshold (e.g., $90,997 for 2024), 15 cents of OAS is lost for every $1 over the threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Strategic planning, such as [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | delaying CPP collection]] until age 70, could help avoid the OAS clawback for longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Reduced Retirement Income**: Ignoring tax implications can lead to a lower-than-expected retirement income and reduce the effectiveness of your overall retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### 2. Investment Risks and Difficulty Outperforming CPP

While the idea of investing early CPP funds seems appealing, it comes with considerable risks and challenges:

*   **Market Volatility**: The stock market is subject to volatility, as seen during the 2008 financial crisis when the TSX index dropped over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Investing early CPP withdrawals during a downturn could severely impact retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Guaranteed vs. Risky Returns**: [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | Delaying CPP collection]] until age 70 increases benefits by 42% over the age 65 amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly benefit at 65 would become $1,420 at 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This higher payment is indexed to inflation, preserving purchasing power, which is difficult to replicate with stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Required Investment Capital**: To match the $420 additional monthly benefit from delaying CPP with a private indexed annuity, one would need to invest approximately $100,000 upfront between ages 60 and 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Amassing such a sum is challenging for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Delaying CPP secures a higher inflation-adjusted income for life without needing to save a large amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   [[financial_incentives_for_delaying_cpp | Delaying CPP offers]] a predictable, secure income, sparing retirees from financial uncertainty tied solely to market returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### 3. Negative Impact on Spousal and Survivor Benefits

Decisions regarding CPP collection also impact a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

*   **Reduced Survivor Benefit**: The amount a spouse receives from the [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | CPP Survivor benefit]] heavily depends on when the deceased partner started their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. If CPP is started at age 60, monthly benefits are reduced by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. For example, a $1,000 monthly benefit at 65 would drop to $640 if started at 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. If the recipient passes away, the spouse might receive 60% of this reduced amount (e.g., $384 instead of $600 if the partner had waited until 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Missed Tax Savings**: Ignoring [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | spousal CPP pension sharing]] or the survivor benefit can mean less financial support for a spouse and missed tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### 4. Over-reliance on CPP

Relying too heavily on CPP as the main source of retirement income can lead to financial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. While CPP aims to replace about one-third (33%) of an average worker's pre-retirement earnings, this is typically insufficient to maintain a desired standard of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For instance, $40,000 annual earnings before retirement might result in only $13,200 per year from CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. This amount may not cover rising costs like healthcare, housing, and daily expenses, especially considering CPP is taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. A comfortable retirement requires diverse income sources, including personal savings, investments (RSP or TFSA), and other pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

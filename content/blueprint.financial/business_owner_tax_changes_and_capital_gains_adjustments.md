The year 2025 brings significant tax changes for business owners in Canada, particularly concerning capital gains and related exemptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These updates necessitate careful planning to maximize tax savings and retain more earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## [[capital_gains_tax_changes_for_corporations | Capital Gains Inclusion Rate Adjustments for Corporations]]

One of the most impactful changes for business owners is the adjustment to the capital gains inclusion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

Previously, 50% of a corporation's capital gains were included in its taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Under the new rules, this inclusion rate has increased to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

*   **Example:** If ABC Corp. realizes a capital gain of $200,000, approximately $133,000 (two-thirds) will be added to the corporation's taxable income under the new rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

It is crucial to note that for corporations, this new capital gains inclusion rate applies from the first dollar of gain, unlike for individuals where the higher rate applies only to net capital gains over $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This change requires more careful [[advanced_tax_strategies_for_small_businesses_in_Canada | planning for business owners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_updates | Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE)]]

The LCGE allows individuals to exclude a portion of capital gains from taxation when selling qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

*   As of 2025, the LCGE limit has significantly increased to $1.25 million, up from $1.01 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Example:** Selling a qualified small business for $1.2 million could result in all capital gains being exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> The LCGE applies to each individual shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If multiple shareholders dispose of shares, each can potentially claim the exemption on their respective gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

## Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive (CEI)

The Canadian Entrepreneurs' Incentive aims to support entrepreneurs by reducing the capital gains inclusion rate to 1/3 on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

*   This incentive is being phased in, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   It is projected to reach $2 million by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Example:** A small business owner selling their enterprise with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would include only one-third of that in their taxable income under the CEI, compared to two-thirds without the incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. This can lead to potential tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Staying informed about these tax updates is vital for effective [[strategies_for_investors_and_business_owners_in_response_to_tax_changes | tax planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

The year 2025 introduces significant tax changes for Canadian business owners, particularly concerning [[managing_capital_gains_and_losses | capital gains]] adjustments and new incentives. Understanding these updates is crucial for maximizing tax savings and effective financial planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Capital Gains Tax Updates for Corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

The [[capital_gains_tax_update_for_corporations_in_2025 | tax structure for capital gains for corporations]] has been revised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Previously, 50% of a corporation's capital gains were included in taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Under the new rules, this inclusion rate has increased to 66.67% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

> ### Example: Corporate Capital Gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>
> If ABC Corp realizes a capital gain of $200,000, two-thirds of that amount, or approximately $133,000, is now added to the corporation's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

Notably, for corporations, this new [[capital_gains_tax_update_for_corporations_in_2025 | capital gains inclusion rate]] applies from the first dollar of gain, unlike individuals who have a $250,000 threshold before the higher rate applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This change necessitates more careful planning for business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption (LCGE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>

The [[lifetime_capital_gains_exemption_increase_in_2025 | Lifetime Capital Gains Exemption]] (LCGE) allows individuals to exclude a portion of capital gains from taxation upon the sale of qualified small business corporation shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

As of 2025, the LCGE limit has significantly increased to $1.25 million, up from $1.01 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

> ### Example: LCGE Application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>
> If you sell a qualified small business for $1.2 million, all the capital gains could be exempt from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Individual Application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
> The LCGE applies to each individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If multiple shareholders dispose of shares, each can potentially claim the exemption on their respective gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive (CEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>

The [[canadian_entrepreneurs_incentive_for_capital_gains | Canadian Entrepreneurs Incentive]] (CEI) aims to support entrepreneurs by reducing the capital gains inclusion rate to one-third on a lifetime maximum of $2 million in eligible capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

This incentive is being phased in, with the limit increasing by $400,000 annually, reaching $2 million by 2029 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

> ### Example: CEI Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>
> A small business owner selling their enterprise with a $100,000 taxable capital gain would include only one-third of that in their taxable income under the CEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, compared to two-thirds without the incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This could result in significant tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Tax Planning and Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>

Effective [[advanced_tax_strategies_for_canadian_small_businesses | tax planning]] involves staying informed and revisiting your strategy to minimize taxes and grow investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Small adjustments now can lead to major financial wins later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

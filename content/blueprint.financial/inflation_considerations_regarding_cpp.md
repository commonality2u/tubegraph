One significant reason to consider delaying Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is to address concerns about inflation in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## CPP and Inflation Indexing
Inflation in Canada has been notably high in recent years, affecting prices for essentials like restaurants, groceries, rent, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:56]</a>. A key benefit of the CPP is that it is indexed to inflation, designed to keep pace with the [[2025_cpp_payment_schedule_and_cost_of_living_adjustments | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

This indexing means that your CPP payments will increase to match periods of high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Benefits of Delaying for Inflation Protection
Delaying your CPP further enhances this protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:

*   **Larger Indexed Payments**: The longer you delay starting your CPP, the larger your inflation-indexed CPP payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Unique Investment**: The CPP is a unique and special pension from the Canadian government because it is one of the few assets on the market that is indexed to inflation, offering support to retirees during times of higher [[2025_cpp_payment_schedule_and_cost_of_living_adjustments | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

By delaying, you secure a higher inflation-adjusted CPP payment, contributing to more predictable and stable income in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This means that instead of relying on potentially fluctuating investment returns, you gain the certainty of increased [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | CPP payouts]] that adjust with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

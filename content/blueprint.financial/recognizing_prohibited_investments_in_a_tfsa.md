A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is a powerful wealth-building tool, but it comes with strict restrictions on what types of investments can be held within it. Failure to adhere to these rules can lead to significant penalties and taxes from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## What are Prohibited Investments?

The CRA has clear guidelines for what constitutes a [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | prohibited investment]] in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. These rules are designed to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Instead, TFSAs are meant for legitimate, "arms-length" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Common types of [[nonqualified_investments_in_tfsa | non-qualified investments]] include:
*   **Significant Interest Holdings** Investing in and owning 10% or more of a private company's shares is considered a prohibited investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Non-Arms Length Relationships** Investments in businesses where you or your family members have significant control or influence are also banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The penalties for holding [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | prohibited investments]] in a TFSA are substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
*   **50% Special Tax** If your TFSA acquires a prohibited investment, you will face a tax equal to 50% of the fair market value of the investment at the time it was acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains** Any income or capital gains earned from these prohibited investments are taxed at 100%, effectively nullifying any benefit from holding them in your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The CRA is very serious about enforcing these rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Example of a Prohibited Investment Penalty
Consider an individual who invests $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative. If the business grows and the shares become worth $50,000, the CRA could deem the investment prohibited due to the close connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The result would be a 50% tax on the $50,000 value, amounting to $25,000. Additionally, the shares must be removed from the TFSA, meaning any future gains would no longer be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## How to Stay Safe

To avoid severe penalties, ensure you are investing only in assets that qualify for a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. It is crucial to consult the CRA's guidelines and review their list of qualified investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Using your TFSA wisely and avoiding these red flags is key to maintaining its powerful wealth-building potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

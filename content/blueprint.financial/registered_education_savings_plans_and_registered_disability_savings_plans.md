Year-end is an important time to consider contributions to your Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) and Registered Disability Savings Plan (RDSP) to maximize available grants and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs)

To ensure your child receives the Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG) for the current year, contributions to your RESP must be made by December 31st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

*   **Canada Education Savings Grant (CESG)**: The government matches 20% of contributions up to $2,500 annually per child, allowing your child to receive up to $500 in CESG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Deadline Impact**: Missing the December 31st deadline means losing out on this year's grant money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

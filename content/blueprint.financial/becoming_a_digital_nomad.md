From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

A digital nomad is defined as an individual who possesses a source of income, typically online, which affords them the flexibility to traverse the globe and work remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Inspiration and Goals

The speaker harbored a long-standing aspiration to become a digital nomad, dreaming of the freedom to work from any location and be their own employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This desire stemmed from earlier experiences backpacking through Asia in their teens and early twenties, where they cherished the adventure, culture, and vitality of that lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The goal was to build a life that provided such freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Beyond personal freedom, the speaker also aimed to create something that would be a positive contribution to the world, specifically by helping to educate Canadians and engaging in work that offered a sense of purpose and joy through aiding others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## The Journey with Wealth Awesome

The journey began with writing for various media and investment publications in Canada on finance-related subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This included ongoing contributions to outlets like CTV News <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. As a result, a substantial following emerged, with tens of thousands of monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Inspired by a friend's suggestion and recognizing a market opportunity for quality financial education in Canada, the speaker decided to launch their own financial education website, Wealth Awesome, in September 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The website was intended to be a platform for creating great content, sharing the speaker's [[alternative_living_and_working_solutions_to_reduce_living_expenses | digital nomad journey]], and indulging a love for writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Financial Milestones and Earnings

The initial financial goal for Wealth Awesome was to achieve $3,000 per month in income and attract 30,000 monthly readers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This goal was eventually exceeded by almost ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

*   **First Income**: It took approximately a year of work, including writing over 150 articles, to earn the first dollar from the site. This came in November 2020 as a $50 affiliate commission from Questrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Goal Achieved**: The $3,000 per month income goal was met in February 2021, roughly a year and a half after the site's inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Peak Earnings**: During its most successful periods, the site generated over $20,000 per month, at one point nearly reaching $30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Total Revenue**: In total, the website generated over $500,000, excluding the proceeds from its eventual sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Revenue Streams

Income from Wealth Awesome was primarily generated through:

*   **Advertising**: After reaching 50,000 visitors per month, the site qualified for premium ad networks like Mediavine (which later lowered its requirement to 10,000 visitors per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. These networks pay based on RPM (Revenue Per Mille or per 1,000 visitors). For finance content with Mediavine, RPMs were high, reaching up to $50 USD per 1,000 visitors. This meant 10,000 visitors could yield about $500 USD (or close to $700 CAD) from advertising alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Commissions**: This involved earning money by recommending and referring specific products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The speaker exclusively recommended products they personally believed in and used, such as Wealthsimple, Questrade, and EQ Bank, which became top affiliate partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Commissions typically ranged from $50 to $100 per signup, with some partners paying $150 or even $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. An example given was an article reviewing Canadian trading platforms, with links to recommended products, earning a commission when someone signed up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Website Traffic and Reach

The growth in traffic was gradual at first, then rapid:

*   **Initial Growth**: It took around 100 articles and 11 months to gain traction, reaching about 5,000 visitors per month by August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   **Rapid Increase**: By January 2021, traffic surged tenfold to 50,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Peak Traffic**: The site peaked in 2022 at approximately 250,000 visitors per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Overall Visitors**: Over its lifespan, Wealth Awesome attracted around 5 million visitors, a significant number for a niche Canadian personal finance site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **YouTube Channel**: A linked YouTube channel garnered almost 14,000 subscribers and 1 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Lessons Learned

Running Wealth Awesome provided valuable lessons:

*   **Technical Skills**: The speaker learned how to design and build a website, perform search engine optimization (SEO), write, create graphics, analyze website data, build an affiliate partner network, monetize a website, hire and manage people, and use various online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Past Experience**: Previous experience as an analyst helped with SEO and outreach data analysis; business-to-business sales experience aided website promotion; and financial advisor experience contributed to writing useful content and connecting with the audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Mental Toughness**: A critical lesson was managing the challenges and fluctuations of running a business. The speaker learned not to be overly reactive to results and to persist through setbacks, realizing that problems will always arise and cannot all be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Timing and Luck**: Timing played a role, with the site starting just before the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were spending more time online and seeking personal finance information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Control**: The speaker learned that while not everything can be controlled, one can control their reaction to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Sale of Wealth Awesome

The decision to sell the site was motivated by several factors:

*   **Loss of Passion**: After several years, the speaker's passion for the website waned, making it difficult to maintain motivation and excitement for content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. A key lesson learned was to move on when the "fire" is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty about the Future**: Concerns about the future of blogging due to advancements in AI, the shift towards video content, and unpredictable Google algorithm updates caused stress and a desire to diversify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The site was sold to a close friend and former colleague, Q, who was building a portfolio of digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The sale was worked out over a couple of weeks, and the speaker was pleased it went to a trusted friend who could bring fresh ideas and manage the site effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Life as a Digital Nomad

The website enabled the speaker to live a true digital nomad lifestyle, providing enough income to support this way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Over the years, the speaker lived in many interesting places, including Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, Bali, Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, the Philippines, the US, Canada, and even Georgia during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This experience led to meeting many interesting people and experiencing a great deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## New Venture: Blueprint Financial

Currently, the speaker is embarking on a new business venture: [[transitioning_from_blogging_to_a_financial_planning_company | Blueprint Financial]], a financial planning company that creates customized financial plans for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This new path aligns with their values and skills, driven by a belief that many people haven't optimized their finances and that significant value can be offered to Canadians and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The speaker was approached by experienced business partners for this venture and has personally experienced the immense value of financial plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Working as a financial advisor was previously the speaker's favorite corporate job due to the intimate, one-on-one connection developed with clients and the personal satisfaction derived from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The new venture aims to provide peace of mind and help clients reach their financial goals, potentially adding substantial money to their retirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The speaker also plans to continue creating free content on their YouTube channel to educate viewers on personal finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

Monitoring your financial goals significantly increases your likelihood of achieving them. According to a study at Michigan State University, tracking goals makes you 33% more likely to attain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Since 2019, consistently [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | tracking my net worth]] has transformed personal finance management and contributed to wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Why Track Your Net Worth?

Tracking net worth is similar to tracking weight loss: small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw substantial improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Those who tracked 40% of the time lost 5% of their weight in six months, while those tracking 70% of the time lost 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This highlights that [[impact_of_consistent_tracking_on_achieving_financial_success | tracking is correlated with success]] toward goals, even if not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The same principle applies to finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | tracking your net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can identify trends, make informed decisions, and remain on course toward your [[setting_and_automating_clear_financial_goals | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Consistency, not perfection, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt is sufficient to stay on track without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

> "Tracking your net worth is like steering a ship with a compass; without that compass, you won't know if you begin to drift off course." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>

Tracking doesn't have to be difficult; tools like a simple Google Sheet can make it easy and rewarding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Initial setup takes about 10-20 minutes, and monthly updates can take as little as two minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## How to Track Net Worth Using a Spreadsheet

A customizable spreadsheet with a visual dashboard can help you [[how_to_track_net_worth_using_a_spreadsheet | track your net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This dashboard will display your current net worth, your net worth goal, and the shortfall needed to reach that goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### 1. Download and Copy the Spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>

*   Make a copy and save it to your computer or Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   Rename the file, ideally with the year, e.g., "2025 Net Worth Tracker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. It's recommended to start a new tracker at the beginning of each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### 2. Set Your Start Month and Net Worth Goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>

*   Go to the "Inputs" section.
*   Set your "Start Month" to the beginning of your current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Enter your "Net Worth Goal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. (For guidance on setting a goal, you can refer to videos on average net worth in Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

    *   Vehicles (you will need to depreciate them over time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>
*   If you run out of space, expand the rows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

    *   Registered accounts (e.g., TFSA, RRSP, LIRA, FHSA, RESP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
    *   Property (e.g., house) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>

    *   Car loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>

### 7. Monitor Your Dashboard and Analyze Trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>

Once your data is entered, the dashboard becomes valuable for [[tracking_and_managing_investment_performance | monitoring progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

*   **Net Worth Trend**: Observe the gradual increase in your net worth throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Identify Dips**: If you see dips in your net worth, investigate the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. For example, a significant drop in registered accounts (like an RSP or LIRA) might indicate a market dip or suggest re-evaluating your risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Assets vs. Liabilities**: The dashboard provides a breakdown of your assets versus liabilities, illustrating how much is in long-term assets versus liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Monthly Progress**: Review the monthly progress, noting significant changes and their potential causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### 8. Annual Review and Archiving

After filling out and analyzing your data for the year, create a new copy of the spreadsheet for the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This allows you to accumulate a historical balance sheet of your net worth, enabling you to compare your performance year over year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Alternative Tracking Tools in Canada

While a custom spreadsheet offers complete control and customization for [[actionable_tips_for_managing_personal_finances_in_canada | managing personal finances in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, several other tools are available:

*   **Wealthica**: Connects to your financial accounts for an automatic net worth overview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. However, advanced features require a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Quicken (Replaced Mint)**: Mint, formerly free and popular in Canada, has been replaced by Quicken, which requires a paid subscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While comprehensive, the cost may not be justified given free alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **PocketGuard**: A budgeting app that monitors spending and manages finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. It offers a free version, but premium features come with a monthly or annual fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Although these tools offer automation, they come with associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. A spreadsheet, by contrast, is free and gives you full control over your tracking process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

A frequent misunderstanding among Canadians concerns how income tax brackets work, particularly when receiving a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. For instance, if an individual's salary increases from $55,000 to $60,000 per year, this could move them into a higher federal tax bracket, potentially from 15% to 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## The Misconception: Entire Salary Taxed at New Bracket
[[common_tax_myths | A common mistake Canadians make]] is believing that their entire salary becomes taxed at the new, higher rateâ€”for example, 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This misconception can lead to the belief that earning more income results in actually losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How the [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian Tax System]] Actually Works
This is not how the [[canadian_tax_system | Canadian tax system]] operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Canada utilizes a progressive tax system, meaning different portions of income are taxed at different rates.

For example:
*   The initial portion of income, such as the first $57,375, is still taxed at the lower rate of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Only the income *above* that threshold is taxed at the higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. In the earlier example, only the additional $2,625 (the amount over $57,375) would be taxed at 20.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The rest of the income remains taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

This means that an individual's average or effective tax rate remains significantly lower than the highest marginal tax bracket they enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Therefore, even if you move into a higher tax bracket, you will always take home more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. More income is consistently beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Don't allow [[common_tax_myths | tax myths]] to discourage you from seeking a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

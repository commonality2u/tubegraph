This article outlines what it takes to join the top 1% of Canadians, focusing on both income and net worth, and provides four realistic ways to achieve this elite status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Understanding the Top 1% in Canada

### Top 1% Income in Canada

To be considered among the top 1% of income earners in Canada, it's essential to understand the thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. According to Statistics Canada data from 2021:
*   The median income for the top 1% was $378,900 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This represents the middle point, effectively the top 0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   The threshold value to officially be in the [[top_1_percent_income_threshold_in_canada | top 1% income earners in Canada]] was $271,600 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This is the bottom point for entering the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Key characteristics of the top 1% income earners in Canada:
*   Around 80% are married or in common-law relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Wages and salaries accounted for 63.1% of their income in 2021 (slightly up from 62.7% in 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This indicates that about one-third of their income comes from sources outside their primary jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This suggests that diversifying income sources can be beneficial for those aiming for the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

While income is important, net worth (total assets minus liabilities) is considered the true measure of being in the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It's possible to be in the top 1% by income but not by net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

A 2021 report from the PBO revealed:
*   The threshold for being in the top 1% of net worth in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Approximately 160,000 families in Canada have achieved this mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Strategies for Achieving Top 1% Status

Here are four realistic [[strategies_for_increasing_income_in_canada | strategies for increasing income in Canada]] and net worth to join the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:

### 1. Pursue a High-Paying Profession

Having a profession that earns close to the top 1% income threshold ($271,600 per year) significantly increases your chances of accumulating the necessary wealth for top 1% net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Examples of professions that can achieve this income level include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>:
*   C-suite level Executives (CEO, CFO, CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
*   Medical specialists (cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
*   Partners in law firms and accounting firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Investment bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>
*   Principal software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
*   Senior data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   Specialized dentists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   Senior software architects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>

These roles typically require many years of specialized education and work experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. However, if your current career path doesn't align with these, other options exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### 2. Start and Scale a Business

Business ownership is a primary way the top 1% earn their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. While not easy, it is possible for anyone to start a successful business and scale it to become rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The wealthiest Canadians often became so by starting businesses, not by working traditional 9-to-5 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

*   **Example:** Tobias LÃ¼tke, founder of Shopify, propelled himself into the elite of Canadian wealth through the company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Financial Rewards:** Business ownership offers significant financial rewards through capital appreciation, profit margins, and potential exits like selling the business or going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Scaling:** A key to wealth through business is the ability to scale, reaching hundreds, thousands, or even millions of customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This allows you to leverage your time and knowledge to provide products or services broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Certain sales roles (e.g., real estate agents, mortgage brokers, pharmaceutical sales reps) can also achieve 1% income levels, acting as a hybrid between salary and business ownership due to high commissions and bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Mark Cuban emphasizes the importance of sales in any business for revenue generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### 3. Invest Wisely

Investing is crucial for achieving top 1% net worth, allowing your money to compound and grow over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Even with a high income, foolish investments can hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

*   **Example:** Anne Scheiber, an IRS auditor, built a $22 million fortune by consistently investing her modest savings in Blue Chip stocks with solid dividends, demonstrating the power of buying and holding high-quality stocks long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:07:08]</a>. This exemplifies [[investing_strategies_for_increasing_net_worth | investing strategies for increasing net worth]].

For beginners, diversification is a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Stock Market:** Consider investing in index funds or ETFs with low fees for broad diversification and a hands-off approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. For more involvement, learn to pick individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Bonds:** To reduce risk, consider investing in fixed income or bonds to complement stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A mix of Canadian stocks and bonds can provide steady growth and protection from market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Real Estate:** Especially in Canada, real estate is a significant and popular wealth builder for Canadians, with most millionaires holding it in their portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Rental properties can provide steady income and property value appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Tax-Advantaged Accounts:** Take full advantage of [[strategies_for_maximizing_tax_savings | tax-advantaged accounts]] like RRSPs, TFSAs, and FHSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. RRSP contributions are tax-deductible, and investments grow tax-free until withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. TFSA investments grow tax-free, and withdrawals are also tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### 4. Be Frugal and Save Most of Your Income

Consistently saving a significant portion of your income and investing it wisely can lead to substantial wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

*   **Example:** Ronald Reed, a janitor and gas station attendant from Vermont, built an $8 million fortune by living frugally and consistently investing in Blue Chip stocks (like Proctor and Gamble, JP Morgan Chase, General Electric) over several decades, reinvesting dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:09:15]</a>. This demonstrates that a huge fortune can be built even with a low income by following the principles of saving a lot and investing wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

While frugality is powerful, be cautious not to engage in "extreme frugality" that negatively impacts your quality of life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Combining Strategies for Success

You don't have to choose just one of these methods; most people combine several <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The best approach depends on your personal risk tolerance and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

*   **Low Risk-Taker with High Income:** If you have a high-paying job but dislike risk, combine wise investing with frugality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Risk-Taker, Less Frugal:** If you enjoy taking risks but prefer not to be overly frugal, consider starting a scalable business, investing profits wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Families with Bills:** If you have children and cannot be overly frugal or take huge risks, focus on increasing your salary through promotions, raises, or training, and invest any excess income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Finding the right combination that suits your lifestyle and needs is key to achieving financial success and joining the top 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Having a solid financial plan is super important when aiming for this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

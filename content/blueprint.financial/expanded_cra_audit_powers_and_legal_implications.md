The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is intensifying its efforts, claiming it misses out on over $20 billion annually in tax revenue [00:00:04]. This has led to an increase in [[Increased CRA Audits and Tax Enforcement | audits]], harsher penalties, and more Canadians being [[Risk Factors for Being Audited by the CRA | flagged]] [00:00:08]. To [[Strategies to Avoid and Respond to CRA Audits | protect yourself]], it's crucial to understand the CRA's expanding audit powers and their potential legal implications [00:02:49].

## Proposed Expanded Audit Powers

Introduced in Budget 2024, the CRA is set to gain sweeping new audit powers to [[Increased CRA Audits and Tax Enforcement | crack down on unpaid taxes]] [03:00]. While aiming to enhance compliance, these changes raise concerns about fairness, due process, and the increasing burden on taxpayers [03:08]. If passed into law, even routine audits could become more invasive [03:14].

### Key Changes Proposed

*   **Fines for Non-Compliance**
    If a taxpayer does not fully cooperate with an audit request, the CRA can issue a Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC), resulting in a fine of $50 per day, up to $25,000, until the issue is resolved [03:37].
*   **Extended Reassessment Period**
    The CRA can pause a taxpayer's reassessment period, effectively extending how long they can conduct an audit [03:48]. If a taxpayer challenges an NNC or fights a CRA demand in court, the reassessment period will not expire and can be indefinitely extended until the case is resolved [04:21].
*   **Questioning Under Oath**
    The CRA will have the power to compel taxpayers to provide oral statements under oath or affirmation [03:54]. This marks a significant shift from current procedures, and this process may not include standard legal protections or formal transcripts like court testimony [04:04].
*   **Severe Compliance Penalties**
    Failure to comply with a court-issued order can result in a 10% penalty on the total tax bill for the years in question [04:11]. Even withholding a single document could trigger this fine [04:19].

## Impact on Taxpayers

These expanded powers mean that CRA audits could become more aggressive, time-consuming, and costly [04:33].
Even for minor issues, taxpayers might face:
*   Penalties before the audit is complete [04:49].
*   Being forced to give statements under oath without standard legal protections [04:51].
*   Increased time and financial resources spent responding to CRA requests [04:57].

## Increased Scrutiny on Aggressive Tax Planning and Evasion

The CRA is taking a much harder stance on [[sean_nethercot_tax_fraud_case_and_its_implications | aggressive tax planning and evasion]] [06:48]. With new data-sharing agreements and enforcement tools, the CRA is targeting individuals and businesses attempting to sidestep tax obligations [07:02].

### Areas of Focus
*   **Offshore Tax Evasion**
    Canada collaborates with over 100 countries through the Common Reporting Standard, enabling financial institutions worldwide to share data with tax authorities [07:11]. This makes it more likely for the CRA to discover undeclared foreign assets or income [07:21].
*   **Corporate Tax Planning**
    Businesses using strategies like income shifting, artificial losses, or questionable tax credits are facing tougher audits [07:27].
*   **Tax Shelters**
    The CRA is investigating tax shelters and setups designed to conceal income through trusts, numbered companies, and shell corporations [07:36]. These methods, often aimed at creating paper losses or manipulating taxable revenue, are under intense scrutiny [07:44].

### Penalties for Evasion
The CRA has increased the number of [[consequences_of_tax_fraud_in_canada | tax evasion cases referred for prosecution]] [07:52]. Individuals and businesses using aggressive tax strategies risk not only hefty fines and interest charges but also [[consequences_of_tax_fraud_in_canada | criminal investigations and even jail time]] [08:02].

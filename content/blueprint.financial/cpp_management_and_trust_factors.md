## Addressing Concerns About CPP Stability

There has been public mistrust regarding the future of the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), with some concerns suggesting it might run out of money, delay payments, or be an unfair system for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

While it is possible for pensions to be underfunded, as seen with General Motors during the 2008 financial crisis where the US government had to intervene and some retirees did not receive full pensions, the CPP is considered highly unlikely to face such issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Financial Sustainability of the CPP

The financial health of the CPP is supported by several factors:
*   **Growing Contributions** CPP contributions are projected to increase significantly. Base CPP contributions are expected to grow from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050. Similarly, additional CPP contributions are forecast to rise from $9.3 billion to $45 billion over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This indicates a substantial cash flow into the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Independent Peer Reviews** The CPP undergoes regular independent peer reviews to ensure the actuarial methods and assumptions are sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Long-term Sustainability** The latest report determined that the CPP is financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This means the CPP is well-funded and faces a very low risk of becoming underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

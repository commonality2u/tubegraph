From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represents a significant 37.8%, or almost four out of every ten, who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Retiring solo significantly alters the planning required for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Single Canadians face unique financial challenges, including a potentially higher tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Financial Disparities

The average retiree income in Canada is often lower than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. As of 2022, for Canadians aged 65 and older:
*   **Couples:** The median after-tax income is $74,200 per year, approximately $6,200 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Single Seniors:** The median after-tax income is only $30,820 per year, approximately $2,568 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is significantly less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Without a partner to split costs, share benefits, or offer a safety net, every dollar becomes more critical for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Higher Tax Burden

One of the biggest financial risks for single retirees is a higher tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Retiring single in Canada often leads to paying substantially more in taxes, not due to an official "single tax," but due to structural differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Single retirees lack access to income splitting or spousal benefits, which can frequently place them in higher tax brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, a single senior in Ontario earning $115,000 in pension income paid $21,000 more in tax than a couple with the same combined income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This is because a couple can split their income and both qualify for full Old Age Security (OAS) and the age credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

[[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Tax planning]] is therefore more crucial for single retirees, as every withdrawal decision can significantly impact their tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. There are smart ways to reduce your tax bill in retirement by strategically managing withdrawals from your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP), Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), Canada Pension Plan (CPP), and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## No Survivor Benefits

A significant financial disadvantage for single retirees is the absence of survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Without a spouse, there's no automatic rollover for RRSPs, Registered Income Funds (RIFs), or pensions upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This can lead to a substantial tax hit to your estate, reducing the money left for beneficiaries or causes you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Some employer pensions also offer limited or no support for single retirees, resulting in fewer guaranteed income options for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

To protect assets:
*   **Plan RRSP and RIF withdrawals carefully:** Gradual withdrawals can help reduce the final tax burden on your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Review beneficiaries regularly:** Ensure RRSP, TFSA, and insurance designations are current to ensure assets go as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Planning Scenarios: Andy Dwire's Case Study

To illustrate effective planning for single retirees, consider Andy Dwire, a 65-year-old single individual planning to retire this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

**Initial Situation:**
*   **Expected Spending:** $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Assets:** $200,000 in RRSP, $100,000 in TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Estimated Return:** 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Other:** No pension, no spouse, good health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Initial Plan:** Take CPP and OAS immediately at age 65, aiming for funds to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### Mistake 1: Not Accounting for Inflation

Andy's initial $50,000/year plan failed to account for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Assuming a 2.1% inflation rate:
*   $50,000 today becomes $55,000 by age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   By age 75, it's about $61,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
This means his purchasing power drops annually, causing money to run out much earlier, around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Correction 1: Adjusting Spending Expectations

A common mistake is overestimating [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | retirement spending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Spending often drops by about 20% upon retirement and further declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Andy's revised spending estimate:
*   $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

This adjustment extends his savings to age 85, a significant improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. His goal progress increased from 54% to 94% with this change alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Correction 2: Delaying CPP and OAS

Andy initially planned to take CPP ($10,000) and OAS ($8,700) at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. By delaying these benefits until age 70, his income significantly increases:
*   CPP: $17,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   OAS: $13,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

This delay pushes his shortfall to age 88, effectively making his plan fully funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_moving_abroad_on_canadian_retirement_benefits | impact of timing on retirement benefits]].

### Correction 3: RRSP Meltdown for Tax Smoothing

Despite being fully funded, Andy's tax rate between ages 65 and 70 was very low because he was primarily withdrawing from his TFSA, which is not counted as income, rather than his RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

To smooth out taxes and optimize withdrawals, an "RRSP meltdown" strategy was employed:
*   Andy drew $30,000 per year from his RRSP from ages 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   This helped cover expenses while delaying CPP and OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

This strategy brought his plan to 102% funded and resulted in a smooth, low effective tax rate (3% to 2% until age 76), ensuring no shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Building a Greater Buffer

While 102% funded is good, a larger buffer provides more comfort. Three additional options were explored:
1.  **Work one extra year:** Earning $80,000 for one more year would increase funding to 114% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Earn income from hobby:** Andy's woodworking hobby could conservatively earn $10,000 a year for six years, increasing funding to 112% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
3.  **Airbnb condo:** Renting out his condo in the summer (when he lives with family) could bring in about $10,000 a year for six years, also leading to 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Andy preferred options 2 or 3 as he didn't want to work another year, emphasizing the importance of starting retirement sustainably and as soon as possible due to declining health with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Retiring as a single person in Canada presents unique challenges, particularly concerning taxes, but with proper planning, it does not have to be overly risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Strategic management of withdrawals, accounting for inflation, and optimizing government benefits can stretch every dollar and help avoid significant tax hits, allowing for a confident retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Comprehensive [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | financial planning]] can provide a clear roadmap and peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

A prescribed rate loan is a legal strategy used in Canada for [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. [[income_splitting_strategies_for_tax_savings | Income splitting]] is recognized as an effective method for families to decrease their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has strict attribution rules preventing high-income earners from simply gifting money to a lower-income spouse for investment purposes (as any income generated would still be taxed at the higher earner's rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, this loophole allows for the legal lending of money at the CRA's prescribed rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This shifts investment income to the lower tax bracket of the spouse, thereby reducing the family's overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Initially designed for corporate planning, this strategy remains effective for families when the rules are adhered to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## How it Works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

1.  **Lending the Money**: The higher-income spouse lends money to the lower-income spouse at the CRA's prescribed interest rate, which is currently 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
2.  **Investment**: The lower-income spouse invests the borrowed money in income-generating assets such as stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Taxation**: Any investment income generated is then taxed at the lower-income spouse's tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
4.  **Interest Payment**: The lower-income spouse must pay interest on the loan annually by January 30th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Failure to do so will cause the strategy to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Example Scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

Consider Jim, who is in a 50% tax bracket, and Pam, who is in a 20% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

*   Jim lends Pam $100,000 at the CRA's prescribed rate of 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Pam invests the money and earns a 30% return, resulting in $30,000 in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   At year-end, Pam sells the investment, triggering taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

**Tax Calculation with Prescribed Rate Loan:**

1.  Pam pays Jim $4,000 in interest on the loan, leaving her with $26,000 in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  Only 50% of capital gains are taxable in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. So, Pam is taxed on $15,000 (50% of $30,000) at her 20% tax rate, paying $3,000 in tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
3.  Jim pays $2,000 tax on the $4,000 of interest he received (taxed at his 50% rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
4.  **Total tax paid by the couple = $3,000 (Pam) + $2,000 (Jim) = $5,000** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

**Comparison (If Jim Invested Alone):**

*   If Jim invested the $100,000 himself, his $30,000 gain would also have $15,000 taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   At his 50% tax bracket, Jim would pay $7,500 in taxes ($15,000 \* 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

**Tax Savings:**

*   By using the prescribed rate loan, the couple saves $2,500 ($7,500 - $5,000) in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means more money stays in their pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   If the income generated were interest or dividend income, the tax savings could potentially be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   While a 30% return might seem high and unsustainable long-term, it's achievable in a single year, as demonstrated by the Vanguard VFV S&P 500 ETF delivering a 35% return in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This example illustrates a best-case scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Risks and Downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>

*   **Investment Risk**: If the investments underperform or lose money, the tax savings might not offset the losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If the market crashes and the lower-income spouse only earns 2% or loses money, they still owe the prescribed interest to the high-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This could force them to use savings or sell investments at a loss to make payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Meanwhile, the high-income spouse still reports the interest as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Changing Prescribed Rate**: The prescribed rate set by the CRA can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. For example, it was 1% in 2020 and is now 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If the rate rises, the strategy becomes less effective as the borrowed money needs to earn more to be worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Strict Payment Rules**: The interest payment must be made on time every year (by January 30th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Missing even one payment will cause the CRA to cancel the entire strategy, and all investment income will be taxed back to the high-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This strategy is most effective in a low-interest-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. With interest rates in Canada starting to drop, it could become more attractive in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

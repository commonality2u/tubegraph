Nearly 1 million Canadians aged 60 to 64 are heading into retirement alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represents a significant 37.8%, or almost four out of every 10, who are single, divorced, widowed, or separated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Retiring solo profoundly changes the approach to retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Financial Realities for Single Canadian Retirees

The average retiree income in Canada is lower than many might expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. As of 2022, for Canadians aged 65 and older:
*   Couples have a median after-tax income of $74,200 per year (approximately $6,200 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
*   Single seniors, however, have a median after-tax income of only $30,820 per year (about $2,568 per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This is significantly less than 50% of what couples earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

[[financial_risks_for_single_retirees | Retiring alone comes with unique financial challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Without a partner to split costs, share benefits, or offer a safety net, every dollar becomes critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Single individuals can often face higher taxes, less government support, and greater pressure to manage all aspects of their finances independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Inflation and Cost of Living as a Major Risk

One of the six biggest financial risks for single retirees is [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation and rising cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | Inflation]] is described as a "silent wealth killer" that quietly erodes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. For single individuals, there's no one to share the burden of [[rising_food_and_housing_expenses | rising costs]] for groceries, housing, or healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This makes planning for [[the_impact_of_inflation_on_retirement_income | inflation]] an absolute necessity for single retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Strategies to Combat Rising Costs

To help money go further, especially over a retirement that could last 30 years or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, retirees are employing several creative strategies to combat rising expenses:
*   **Downsizing or Renting Out Space** Many retirees are choosing to downsize their homes or rent out spare rooms to unlock equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Co-living Arrangements** Exploring options like co-living with friends or house-hacking can help cut fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Relocation** A growing number of retirees are moving to lower-cost provinces within Canada or even to other countries to stretch their retirement dollars further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This movement is gaining significant popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## The Impact of Inflation on Retirement Planning: An Example

Consider Andy Dwire, a single 65-year-old planning to retire this year, worried about having enough saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Initial Plan and Inflationary Oversight
Andy initially estimated needing $50,000 per year in retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. He possessed $200,000 in his RRSP and $100,000 in his TFSA, expecting a 5% return, with no pension or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. His goal was for his money to last until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

However, his first major mistake was not accounting for [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Assuming a modest 2.1% [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | inflation]] rate:
*   His $50,000 annual spending would become approximately $55,000 by age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   By age 75, it would rise to about $61,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

This meant his actual purchasing power would drop each year, causing his money to run out much earlier than anticipated, specifically around age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Adjusting for Realistic Spending and Inflation
Andy also overestimated his retirement spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Most people find their spending drops by around 20% upon retirement and often further declines with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

With a revised spending estimate:
*   $40,000 per year in his 60s and early 70s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   $35,000 in his 70s and early 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   $30,000 or less after age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

These adjustments extended Andy's savings up to age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, a significant improvement from age 74, boosting his goal progress from 54% to 94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Further Optimization for Cost of Living and Taxes
Delaying CPP and OAS benefits until age 70 significantly increased his annual income from these sources (e.g., CPP from ~$10,000 to ~$17,000 and OAS from ~$8,700 to ~$13,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, pushing his shortfall past age 88 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, effectively fully funding his plan for his expected lifespan.

An RRSP "meltdown" strategy—withdrawing $30,000 annually from his RRSP between ages 65 and 69—helped smooth out his effective tax rate, keeping it very low (2-3%) during his early retirement years while delaying government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This strategic withdrawal ensured no shortfall even past age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Building a Buffer Against Unforeseen Costs
Even at 102% funded, a buffer is advisable. Andy could further improve his financial security by:
1.  **Working one extra year:** Earning $80,000 for one more year would increase his funding to 114% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Monetizing a hobby:** Earning $10,000 annually for six years from woodworking would bring him to 112% funded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
3.  **Renting out property:** Airbnb-ing his condo for $10,000 annually for six years would also result in 112% funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Andy preferred options two or three as he did not wish to work another year, prioritizing starting retirement as early as possible in a sustainable manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

While [[cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirement | retirement as a single person in Canada]] can present significant [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living challenges]] and [[challenges_faced_by_retirees_in_saving_for_retirement | financial risks]], including higher taxes, no survivor benefits, and the relentless [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_retirees | impact of inflation]], these can be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. With smart planning, including careful consideration of [[the_impact_of_inflation_on_retirement_income | inflation]] and strategic income management, single retirees can stretch their dollars, minimize tax burdens, and achieve a confident retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

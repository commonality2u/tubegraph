Delaying the collection of your Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits beyond age 60 can be a strategic financial decision for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. While starting CPP at age 60 is an option, there are several compelling reasons why holding off could lead to a more secure and comfortable retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The optimal [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | timing of CPP benefits]] depends on individual financial circumstances and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Higher Monthly Payments
One of the most apparent [[financial_incentives_for_delaying_cpp | financial incentives for delaying CPP]] is that you receive significantly more money by waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
*   If you start CPP at age 65, the baseline benefit is, for example, $1,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Starting at age 60 reduces benefits by 0.6% per month, totaling a 36% reduction compared to age 65, resulting in only $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This illustrates the [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_early_cpp_withdrawal | impact of early withdrawal]].
*   Delaying until age 70 increases benefits by 0.7% per month, leading to a 42% increase versus starting at age 65, which could mean $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP to age 70 can more than double the monthly benefit compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_collection | impact of delaying CPP collection]] on total benefits.

## Sufficient Income or Savings
If you possess enough income or savings to cover your expenses between ages 60 and 70, delaying CPP is a strong consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   You can comfortably draw from sources like Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RSPs), Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs), or workplace pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   This strategy allows your investments to continue growing while avoiding an early reduction of your CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   At age 70, the increased CPP payments provide a significant boost to your retirement income, enhancing financial stability and providing a higher guaranteed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   However, if there's an immediate need for funds at age 60, starting CPP then may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This demonstrates how [[factors_influencing_cpp_start_age_decision | factors influencing CPP start age decision]] are personal.

## Good Health and Longevity
For individuals in excellent health, delaying CPP can be a wise choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   A 60-year-old in Canada is currently expected to live to about 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   Starting CPP at 60 locks in a lower monthly amount for life, which might not be sufficient if you live longer than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Delaying CPP helps hedge against the risk of outliving other retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   The CPP benefit lasts for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   The point where you earn more money by delaying CPP from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. If you anticipate living beyond this age, delaying is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_health_on_cpp_timing_decisions | impact of health on CPP timing decisions]].

## Inflation Protection
The CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning your payouts increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   For example, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   The longer you delay, the larger your inflation-indexed CPP payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This provides a unique and special pension to support retirees during times of higher cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Trust in CPP Management
If you trust that the CPP is managed well, delaying can be a sound decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Concerns about the CPP running out of money are highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   CPP contributions are projected to grow significantly, from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 for the base CPP, and from $9.3 billion to $45 billion for the additional CPP over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   The CPP undergoes regular independent peer reviews, confirming its financial sustainability for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   The CPP Investment Portfolio has delivered decent long-term returns, with a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as of the 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Avoiding OAS Clawback
Delaying CPP can be beneficial if you are not worried about your Old Age Security (OAS) payments being clawed back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   OAS payments can be substantial, up to $784 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   However, OAS is subject to clawbacks if your income exceeds a certain threshold, which was $90,997 as of the latest figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   If your total retirement income, including delayed CPP, remains below this threshold, you avoid the clawback and receive your full OAS, in addition to larger CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This demonstrates the [[impact_of_delaying_cpp_and_oas_on_benefits | impact of delaying CPP and OAS on benefits]].

## Not Qualifying for GIS
If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from other sources (like RSPs or work pensions) and thus won't qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS), delaying CPP is another sensible choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   In this scenario, larger CPP payments resulting from delaying won't impact your eligibility for GIS, as you wouldn't qualify for it anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## RSP Tax Planning
Delaying CPP can align with strategies to draw down your RSP more quickly in retirement, especially if you aim to minimize taxes upon death and leave more for your estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Between ages 60 and 70, you can use RSP withdrawals to cover living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Once your enhanced CPP benefits begin at age 70 (e.g., $21,000 annually), you'll need less income from other sources like RSPs or TFSAs to meet your expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   This can lead to paying less taxes upon death and leaving a larger estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Still Working in Retirement
With more Canadians working later into their 60s and 70s, delaying CPP can be advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   If you're still working, you likely won't need the CPP income early, making it easier to delay for higher payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   Even if you start CPP early at 60, you'll still need to make contributions from age 60 to 65 if you continue working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   The benefit from delaying CPP is likely to be greater than investing the early CPP payments, as it's difficult to achieve such an increase in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## More Predictable and Stable Income
Delaying CPP can provide a more predictable and stable income stream in later retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   By using other savings (RSP, TFSA, non-registered assets) to cover expenses between 60 and 70, you trade uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   Instead of relying on potentially fluctuating market returns, you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment (e.g., $1,000 per month starting at age 65) for the remainder of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Ultimately, the decision of when to start CPP is deeply personal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. While there are many logical reasons to delay, starting at age 60 might be appropriate for others based on their unique [[factors_influencing_cpp_start_age_decision | personal financial situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Understanding the difference between average and median income is crucial for grasping financial realities, as there can be a significant gap between perception and reality in income statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While both are measures of central tendency, the median often provides a more accurate representation of typical earnings because it is less affected by extreme values.

## Average Income Defined

The average income is calculated by summing all incomes in a group and dividing by the number of incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This method, while straightforward, can be easily distorted by [[impact_of_high_earners_on_average_income_statistics_in_canada | a few very high earners or outliers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Median Income Defined

The median income represents the middle number when all incomes are lined up in numerical order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It provides a clearer picture of what's typical for the majority of people because it is not swayed by exceptionally high or low incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Illustrating the Difference: The Connor McDavid Example

Consider an example where five friends each earn $100,000 annually. If [[impact_of_high_earners_on_average_income_statistics_in_canada | a high earner]] like Connor McDavid, making $20 million a year, joins the group, the calculation changes dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

*   **Average Salary:** The total earnings for the six individuals would be $20,400,000 ($500,000 + $20,000,000). Dividing this by five people (in the example's simplified group of five, including McDavid), the average salary jumps to over $4 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This figure does not reflect what most individuals in that group earn, as it is skewed by McDavid's massive salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Median Salary:** When the salaries are lined up in order, the median would still be $100,000 (assuming five individuals, three would be at $100,000), which more accurately represents what most of the group is actually making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Canadian Income Statistics (2018-2022)

In Canada, the distinction between average and median income is evident in general statistics:

*   **Average Income:** Increased from $54,600 in 2018 to $57,400 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   **Median Income:** Rose from $41,000 in 2018 to $44,000 in 2021, before a slight dip in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

The difference highlights how the average can be higher due to the influence of high earners. For example, in 2022, the average hourly wage in Canada was about $35.57, while the median wage was $30.98, reflecting what most people earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Similarly, Ontario in 2022 had a median income of $42,700, but a much higher average of $58,700, indicating a significant disparity between high and low-income jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Understanding this difference is crucial for interpreting income data accurately.

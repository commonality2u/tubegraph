When expanding or restructuring a business, various costs can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Business Restructuring Costs

Costs associated with business restructuring, such as legal fees, accounting fees, and other professional services, are typically considered capital expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. These costs may need to be amortized over several years rather than being fully deducted in the year they were incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

## Business Acquisitions

When acquiring another business, the purchase price is allocated among the various assets obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. These assets include inventory, equipment, and goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. These acquired assets can then be depreciated over time, providing ongoing tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Valuing and Categorizing Assets

Properly valuing and categorizing these assets is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Misclassification can result in incorrect deductions and potential issues with the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Professional Guidance

It is highly recommended to work with a professional appraiser or accountant during the acquisition process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

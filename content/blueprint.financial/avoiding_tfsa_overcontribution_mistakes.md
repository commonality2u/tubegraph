[[mistakes_to_avoid_in_tfsa_investing | Making wrong moves]] with your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can result in significant financial losses down the road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. One of the most critical [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | TFSA mistakes]] to avoid is [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontributing]] to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

## Consequences of Overcontribution

[[overcontributing_to_tfsa | Overcontributing to your TFSA]] can lead to severe [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Any amount deposited over your TFSA limit is subject to a 1% monthly [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | penalty]] on the excess amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Correcting this typically involves withdrawing the overcontribution and may require negotiation with the CRA, leading to wasted time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Common Overcontribution "Gotchas"

There are three common scenarios that can lead to accidental [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontribution]]:

### 1. Trusting the CRA's Contribution Limits

Relying solely on the CRA's website for your TFSA contribution limits can be risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The CRA's online information may not immediately reflect recent transactions, potentially causing an accidental [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

> [00:10:06] **Example:** "What happened to me one year was I wasn't sure how much I contributed so I logged into the CRA website and I saw that I still had $5,000 of room left but it actually didn't account for the $5,000 that I had put in already so I was actually at the limit I did end up overcontributing and did have to pay a penalty at the end of the year which I wasn't happy about but it was an important lesson learned"

Keeping your own meticulous records, such as a spreadsheet or a quick note, is advisable to track your remaining contribution room accurately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### 2. Re-contributing in the Same Year

Withdrawing money from your TFSA and then re-contributing it in the same calendar year does not immediately restore your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The room from a withdrawal is only restored in the following calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. If you are at your limit and re-contribute too soon, you could face [[overcontributing_to_rrsps_or_tfsas_and_its_penalties | penalties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It is best to wait until the next calendar year to re-contribute withdrawn funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### 3. Not Transferring Investments "In Kind" Correctly

When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the cash into your TFSA can inadvertently lead to [[overcontributing_to_tfsa | overcontribution]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. To avoid this, you can transfer investments "in kind" without selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, even with "in kind" transfers, careful attention to timing is necessary to avoid unintentionally reducing your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

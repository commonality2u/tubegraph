Canada is currently experiencing a serious [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Approximately 50% of Canadians are living paycheck to paycheck, according to Equifax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Social media platforms are filled with videos of individuals expressing their struggles to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A recent Angus Reed poll revealed that a shocking 40% of recent immigrants are considering moving to another province or even leaving Canada entirely, primarily due to the high [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Rising Costs of Everyday Items

The frustration among Canadians is largely driven by the continually [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | rising cost of everyday items]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Groceries
The grocery store is a prime example of these increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. David Olive noted in a Toronto Star article that a basket of 18 household items, which cost $82 in March 2021, now costs $113.32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This represents a staggering 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The latest Canada Food Price Report predicts an increase of about $701 in the average family of four's annual food bill this year, bringing the total average to $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. This comes on top of a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Food prices have consistently outpaced the average rate of inflation in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, contributing significantly to the [[impact_of_inflation_on_grocery_costs_in_canada | impact of inflation on grocery costs in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

### Rental and Housing Costs
Rent is another significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. By July 2024, this average had increased to $3,648 per month, a 40% rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The average cost to buy a house in Canada has also soared, from $413,000 in 2015 to $699,000 in May 2024, a 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Both shelter and food, two essential expenses, have become significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, driving the [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | rising food and housing costs in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Beyond these, costs for transportation, entertainment, and nearly everything else have also increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, making it tough for many Canadians to get by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Stagnant Incomes and Wider Impacts

Unfortunately, income growth has not kept pace with the increase in the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. In 2022, the median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals was $70,500, a decrease from $73,000 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Average wages have likely not increased substantially in 2023 or 2024 to match inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This [[income_disparity_and_challenges_in_canada | income disparity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, coupled with the discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs, has further strained finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

### Interprovincial Migration
High housing costs are prompting significant interprovincial migration, with 28% of all Canadians considering leaving their current province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This trend is particularly evident in Ontario and British Columbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Alberta has become a popular relocation spot, with 18% of Canadians considering a move there due to more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. From 2022 to 2023, net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver exceeded 130,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Unhappiness Among Youth
The World Happiness Report by Gallup World Poll ranks Canada as the 15th happiest country overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. However, Canadians under the age of 30 fall significantly lower, ranking 58th, highlighting a bleak outlook for younger generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## Strategies to Combat the High Cost of Living

While many issues stem from uncontrollable economic factors, individuals can manage what they can control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. The two main approaches are to earn more money or to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

While challenges persist, there is hope for better economic conditions and effective government solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

## [[comparison_of_top_earners_to_the_average_canadian_income_by_age_group | Comparison to Average Canadian Income]]

There is a stark contrast between the incomes of top earners and the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age_group | median income for Canadians by age group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The median income for most Canadians ranges between $35,000 and $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

*   The highest median income, for the 45-54 age group, is still $51,500 below the top 10% threshold of $111,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   The top 5% threshold of $147,100 is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25-to-34-year-old Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Ultimately, income is just the starting point; what one does with it determines financial freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The story of Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through simple, consistent investing despite a low salary, highlights that making every dollar count is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

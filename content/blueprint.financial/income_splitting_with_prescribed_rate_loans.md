[[introduction_to_income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is recognized as one of the most effective methods for families to lower their overall tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Canada has some of the highest income tax rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The prescribed rate loan is one of the remaining legal [[income_splitting_strategies_in_canada | income splitting]] "loopholes" available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. While the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) has strict attribution rules designed to prevent high-income earners from simply gifting money to a lower-income spouse for investment purposes, which would typically result in the investment income still being taxed at the higher earner's rate, this specific loophole allows for legal lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## What is a Prescribed Rate Loan?

A prescribed rate loan allows a high-income individual to legally lend money to a lower-income spouse at the CRA's prescribed interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This shifts the investment income generated from that money into the lower tax bracket of the recipient spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Although originally conceived for corporate planning, this strategy remains viable for families when rules are properly followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The prescribed rate is currently 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## How it Works

The process involves several key steps:
1.  **Lending the Money** The high-income spouse lends funds to the low-income spouse at the CRA's prescribed interest rate (e.g., 4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
2.  **Investing the Funds** The low-income spouse then invests this money in income-generating assets such as stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Taxation at Lower Rate** Any investment income generated is taxed at the lower-income spouse's tax rate, which reduces the family's overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
4.  **Annual Interest Payment** The low-income spouse *must* pay interest on the loan annually by January 30th for the strategy to remain valid; otherwise, it collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Example Scenario

Consider a scenario with Jim and Pam:
*   Jim is in a 50% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Pam is in a 20% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

1.  **The Loan:** Jim lends Pam $100,000 at the prescribed rate of 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  **Investment Return:** Pam invests the money and earns a 30% return, resulting in $30,000 in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. At year-end, she sells the investment, triggering taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  **Tax Calculation (Prescribed Rate Loan):**
    *   Pam pays Jim $4,000 in interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, leaving her with $26,000 in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   Only 50% of capital gains are taxable in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, so Pam is taxed on $15,000 ($30,000 * 0.50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   At her 20% tax rate, Pam pays $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Jim pays $2,000 in tax on the $4,000 interest he received (at his 50% rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   Total tax paid by the couple is $3,000 (Pam) + $2,000 (Jim) = $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
4.  **Tax Calculation (Jim Investing Alone):**
    *   If Jim invested the $100,000 himself, his $30,000 gain (with $15,000 taxable) would be taxed at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Jim would pay $7,500 in taxes ($15,000 * 0.50) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
5.  **Tax Savings:** By using the prescribed rate loan strategy, Jim and Pam save $2,500 in taxes ($7,500 - $5,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This means more money stays in their pockets instead of going to the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

If the investment income were interest or dividend income, the tax savings could be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While a 30% return may seem high and is unlikely to be sustained long-term, it is entirely possible in a single year; for example, the Vanguard VFV S&P 500 ETF delivered a 35% return in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This example illustrates a best-case scenario for this [[income_splitting_strategies_for_couples | income splitting]] strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Risks and Downsides

Despite its benefits, the prescribed rate loan strategy comes with significant risks:

*   **Investment Risk** If Pam's investments underperform, the tax savings may not offset the losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If she earns only 2% or loses money, she still owes the $4,000 in interest to Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This could force her to use savings or sell investments at a loss to make payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Jim also still reports the $4,000 as taxable income, even if Pam didn't profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Changing Prescribed Rate** The CRA's prescribed rate can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. If the rate rises (e.g., from 1% in 2020 to 4% currently) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, the strategy becomes less effective, as the loan money needs to generate a higher return to be worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Strict Payment Rules** Pam must pay the interest on time every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Missing even one payment will cause the CRA to cancel the entire strategy, and all investment income will be taxed back to Jim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This strategy is most effective in a low-interest-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. With interest rates starting to drop in Canada, it could become more appealing in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

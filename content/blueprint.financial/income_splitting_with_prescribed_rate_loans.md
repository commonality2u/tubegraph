Canada has some of the highest income tax rates globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. One legal strategy to reduce your tax bill is by using a prescribed rate loan to achieve [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This method is considered one of the last legal [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] loopholes in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

[[income_splitting_strategies | Income splitting]] is an effective way for families to lower their total tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Normally, the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) has strict attribution rules that prevent high-income individuals from simply gifting money to a lower-income spouse for investment, as the investment income would still be taxed at the higher earner's rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. However, a prescribed rate loan allows a legal workaround by lending money at the CRA's specified rate, thereby shifting investment income to the lower tax bracket of the recipient spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While originally designed for corporate planning, this strategy remains viable for families when the rules are followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## How a Prescribed Rate Loan Works

The process involves several key steps:
1.  **Loan Issuance** The spouse with a higher income lends money to the spouse with a lower income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The loan must be made at the CRA's prescribed interest rate, which is currently 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  **Investment** The low-income spouse then invests the borrowed funds in income-generating assets, such as stocks or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Taxation of Income** Any investment income generated is taxed at the lower tax rate of the low-income spouse, leading to a reduction in the overall family tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
4.  **Interest Payment** Critically, the low-income spouse *must* pay the interest on the loan annually by January 30th of the following year. Failure to do so will cause the entire strategy to fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Illustrative Scenario: Jim and Pam

Consider a scenario where Jim is in a 50% tax bracket, and Pam is in a 20% tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

1.  **Loan and Investment** Jim lends Pam $100,000 at the CRA's prescribed rate of 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Pam invests this amount and earns a 30% return, resulting in $30,000 in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
2.  **Interest Payment** Pam pays Jim $4,000 in interest on the loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
3.  **Pam's Tax Calculation** After paying interest, Pam has $26,000 in gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Since only 50% of capital gains are taxable in Canada, Pam is taxed on $15,000 (half of the $30,000 gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. At her 20% tax rate, she pays $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
4.  **Jim's Tax Calculation** Jim receives $4,000 in interest from Pam and pays $2,000 tax on it at his 50% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
5.  **Total Tax Paid** The total tax paid by Jim and Pam combined is $5,000 ($3,000 + $2,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Comparison to Jim Investing Alone

If Jim had invested the $100,000 himself and earned a $30,000 gain, the $15,000 taxable portion would be taxed at his 50% rate, resulting in a tax bill of $7,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Using the prescribed rate loan strategy, Jim and Pam save $2,500 in taxes ($7,500 - $5,000) by shifting the investment gains to Pam's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This savings could be even greater if the income generated is interest or dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While a 30% return might seem high, it's entirely possible in a single year (e.g., the Vanguard VFV S&P 500 ETF delivered 35% in 2024) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Risks and Downsides

While powerful, this strategy carries several risks:

*   **Investment Risk** If the investments underperform or incur losses, the tax savings may not offset these losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. If Pam only earns 2% or loses money, she still owes Jim the $4,000 interest payment, potentially requiring her to dip into savings or sell investments at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Jim, meanwhile, still reports the $4,000 as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Changing Prescribed Rate** The CRA's prescribed rate can change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. If the rate rises (e.g., from 1% in 2020 to 4% presently), the strategy becomes less effective as the loan money needs to generate a higher return to be worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Strict Payment Rules** The low-income spouse must pay the interest on time every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Missing even one payment will cause the CRA to cancel the entire strategy, and all investment income will be taxed back to the high-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This strategy is most effective in a low-interest-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. With interest rates potentially dropping in Canada, it could become more attractive in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

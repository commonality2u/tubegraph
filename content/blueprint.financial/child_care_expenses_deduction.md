The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) provides tax deductions for [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | child care expenses]] to help families reduce their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Eligibility Criteria

To claim [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | child care expenses]], the child must meet specific criteria:
*   Be under 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Have a physical or mental impairment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Eligible Expenses

You can claim expenses for various types of [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | child care services]], including:
*   Daycare centers and nurseries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Caregivers such as nannies or babysitters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Boarding schools and overnight camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Educational institutions, specifically for the portion related to [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | child care]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Non-Eligible Expenses

Certain costs are **not** eligible for the [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | child care expenses]] deduction:
*   [[medical_expenses_and_charitable_donations_for_tax_credits | Medical]] or hospital care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   Tuition for regular schooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Recreational activities, such as sports or art classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   Transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Claim Limits

The maximum amount you can claim per child depends on their age and condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>:
*   **Under 7 years of age:** Up to $8,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Between 7 and 16 years of age:** Up to $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **With a disability:** Up to $11,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Example Calculation

Consider a family with two children, ages 4 and 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. In 2023, they incurred the following expenses:
*   $6,000 for daycare for the 4-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   $4,000 for after-school care for the 9-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

```
Since both expenses are below their respective maximum allowable deductions ($8,000 for the 4-year-old and $5,000 for the 9-year-old), the family can claim the full amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
Total deduction = $6,000 + $4,000 = $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

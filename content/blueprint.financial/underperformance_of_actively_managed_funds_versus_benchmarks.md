Mutual funds are a significant part of the investment landscape in Canada, with over $2 trillion invested as of May 2024. This contrasts with $429 billion in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), indicating that mutual funds remain almost five times more popular than ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, a former financial advisor at a big five Canadian bank notes numerous hidden downsides to [[negative_impact_of_mutual_funds_on_wealth_growth | mutual funds]], particularly their tendency to underperform benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## What Are Actively Managed Mutual Funds?

The discussion specifically refers to high-cost, actively managed mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. These funds pool money from many investors to acquire a diverse portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Professional portfolio managers or teams oversee these funds, making strategic decisions to buy and sell assets with the aim of outperforming a benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Unfortunately, Canadian mutual funds frequently fall short of this objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Reasons for Underperformance

### High Fees

One primary reason for the [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] of Canadian mutual funds is their [[high_fees_associated_with_mutual_funds | high fees]], which are among the highest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Average Management Expense Ratios (MERs)**:
    *   Equity funds: approximately 1.76% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
    *   Allocation funds: about 1.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
    *   Fixed income funds: 0.89% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
    *   These figures are based on Morningstar's 2022 report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Some equity fund MERs, such as those found on TD Bank's website, can exceed 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

*   **Impact of Fees**: A seemingly small 2% management fee can significantly erode investment returns over the long term due to compounding interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   For an initial investment of $100,000 at a 7% annual return:
        *   Without fees, it grows to $387,000 over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
        *   With a 2% fee (actual return 5%), it grows to $265,000 over 20 years, a difference of $122,000 (nearly one-third of potential returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
        *   Over 30 years, the difference is even more dramatic: $761,000 without fees versus $432,000 with fees, a staggering $329,000 difference (43% of potential returns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Low Returns

A significant percentage of actively managed funds in Canada consistently [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperform]] their respective benchmarks across various time horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

*   **Canadian Equity Funds**: Over a recent 10-year period, 96.63% of Canadian Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark, the S&P TSX Composite Index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The S&P TSX Composite Index achieved an annualized return of 7.62% over those 10 years, whereas Canadian Equity Funds managed only 5.64% on an equal-weighted basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This difference closely mirrors the average 2% management fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

*   **Specific Categories**:
    *   98% of Canadian-focused Equity Funds underperformed their benchmark over the same 10-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   88.6% of Canadian dividend and income Equity Funds also fell short of their benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   Even over shorter periods (five and three years), the majority of these funds continue to lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   This issue isn't limited to large-cap equity funds; 76.19% of Canadian small to mid-cap equity funds underperformed their benchmark over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

This consistent [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] across different fund categories points to a systemic problem within the Canadian mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Tricky Marketing Tactics

Banks and financial institutions often use [[deceptive_marketing_tactics_in_the_mutual_fund_industry | deceptive marketing tactics]] to obscure the truth about mutual fund performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

*   **Survivorship Bias**: Financial institutions tend to highlight only successful mutual funds, showcasing top performers while ignoring or quietly closing and merging underperforming funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This selective reporting creates an illusion of consistent high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
    *   Over a recent 10-year period, 43% of Canadian Equity Funds were either merged or liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   On average, across all categories, 39% of funds disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   Only 57.3% of Canadian Equity Funds survived, and for Canadian-focused Equity Funds, the survivorship rate was even lower at 43.14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Star Ratings**: Marketing tools like Morningstar's five-star ratings can mislead investors into believing certain funds will achieve better performance, despite studies showing that these "star funds" often underperform in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

### Tax Inefficiency Concerns

[[tax_inefficiency_of_mutual_funds_in_canada | Tax inefficiency]] can further reduce investor returns, particularly in non-registered taxable accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Capital Gains Distributions**: Mutual funds distribute realized capital gains to investors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This means investors can incur a tax bill on gains even if they haven't sold any shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Frequent Trading**: Actively managed funds often engage in frequent trading, leading to short-term capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. These gains are taxed at higher rates (regular income tax rates) than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Lack of Control**: Investors have no control over the timing of capital gain or loss realizations within the fund, which can result in taxable events at inopportune times, increasing tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Aggressive Distribution Channels

Despite their downsides, mutual funds remain popular due to their aggressive distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

*   **Accessibility and Convenience**: Mutual funds are easy to access and convenient for average investors, offering a straightforward way to diversify without extensive market knowledge or large capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Bank Push**: Banks and financial advisors actively push mutual funds, often due to aggressive sales targets, leading many Canadians to invest in them over more cost-effective options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Mutual funds are very high-profit products for banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Perceived Professional Expertise**: Investors are drawn to the idea that mutual funds are managed by professional portfolio managers, who are seen as experts capable of making informed investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Despite data indicating otherwise, people tend to believe in the expertise of these fund managers, hoping for high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

## Alternatives to Mutual Funds

Given the [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] and other issues, several [[alternative_investment_strategies_to_dividend_etfs | alternatives]] to mutual funds exist in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

*   **Robo-advisors**: Offer a convenient and cost-effective investment method with lower fees (about half of mutual fund fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Examples include Questwealth and Wealthsimple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Hiring a Portfolio Manager**: Can be more cost-effective than mutual funds, offering personalized investment strategies and professional management at lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Building Your Own ETF Portfolios**: Offers greater flexibility, lower fees, and better tax efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. In May 2024, mutual funds experienced net redemptions of $1.8 billion, while ETFs saw net sales of $4.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Do-It-Yourself Stock Portfolio**: The most hands-on and potentially rewarding option, allowing direct control over investments, minimal fees, and portfolio customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This approach requires significant knowledge, research, and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

While mutual funds are popular in Canada, their [[high_fees_associated_with_mutual_funds | high fees]] and consistent [[mutual_funds_underperformance_compared_to_benchmarks | underperformance]] against benchmarks can significantly impact long-term returns and wealth growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

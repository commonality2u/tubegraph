The traditional retirement age of 65 was effective when housing costs were lower and most individuals did not live past 75 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, modern retirees can now live for 30 or more years in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This significant increase in lifespan is a primary reason why more Canadians are choosing to work past age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, necessitating a more comprehensive [[importance_of_retirement_planning | retirement plan]] to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Current Life Expectancy Trends

Canadians are living longer than in the past, a positive development that significantly impacts retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Life expectancy is not fixed; it increases as an individual ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Surviving to an older age means one has already bypassed many life risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Projected life expectancies for the average Canadian based on current age include:
*   **At age 40:** Men are expected to live to 78, and women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **At age 50:** Men are projected to live to 79, and women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **At age 60:** Men are looking at an 80.5-year life expectancy, and women at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **At age 70:** Men reach about an 83.2-year life expectancy, and women at 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

A healthy individual reaching age 65 can anticipate two or more additional decades of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Implications for Retirement

This extended lifespan means that retirement is no longer a short-term plan of 10 years, but rather a 20 to 30-year lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This requires:
*   **More years to fund:** An increased number of years that require financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **More health to manage:** Increased time spent on managing health and potential healthcare costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **More time for purpose:** An extended period to discover and pursue interests beyond work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

This shift underscores the importance of strategic planning, including considerations like the [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | timing of CPP]] and OAS benefits, and developing a robust withdrawal strategy from savings like RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Without careful planning, even substantial savings can be depleted prematurely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. For example, delaying retirement by just three years can significantly extend financial security into later life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

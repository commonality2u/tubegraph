Many investors are unaware that the fees associated with their [[hidden_investment_fees_in_canada | investments]], particularly mutual funds, can significantly erode their wealth over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Financial institutions generate billions of dollars from these fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, and a common mistake is underestimating their long-term [[impact_of_investing_and_compounding_returns_on_net_worth_growth | impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## The Hidden Cost of Fees

Even seemingly small fees can have a devastating effect on long-term investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. For example, a 2% annual fee could reduce the final value of an investment by over 50% over 30 years, potentially costing hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Consider an investment of $100,000 earning a 7% annual return over 30 years:
*   **Without fees:** The investment would grow to approximately $761,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **With a 2% annual fee:** The investment would only grow to about $432,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
This represents a difference of nearly $330,000 lost to fees, meaning 2% in fees wiped out 43% of potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Types of Fees That Destroy Wealth

Several types of fees commonly found in mutual funds can erode investor wealth:

*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: This is a primary fee for mutual funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. An MER over 1.6% for equity funds or 0.75% for bond funds is generally considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In stark contrast, most index Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) charge MERs between 0.05% to 0.25%, making mutual fund fees up to 30 times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Hidden Trailer Fees**: Many mutual funds include commissions, often around 1%, paid to advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These fees can incentivize advisors to recommend higher-fee funds over what might be best for the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **High Trading Fees (Turnover Ratio)**: Mutual funds that frequently buy and sell stocks incur significant trading costs, which are often passed on to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Red Flags Indicating High Fees

Investors should be wary of several signs indicating they might be paying excessive fees:

*   **Advisor's Reluctance to Explain Fees**: If an advisor avoids explaining fees clearly or makes the fee structure confusing, it likely benefits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **High Redemption Fees**: Some mutual funds penalize investors for switching to a different investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **[[fees_associated_with_segregated_funds_and_trading | Segregated Funds]]**: These funds, often sold by insurance companies, can look like mutual funds but typically have extremely high fees (3-4%) and include insurance features most investors don't need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Signs it's a segregated fund include being held with an insurance company (e.g., Sunlife, Manulife, Canada Life), the presence of words like "segregated" or "guaranteed benefits," fees exceeding 3%, or a maturity period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Closet Indexing: Paying High Fees for Index Returns

[[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | Closet indexing]] is a significant issue in the mutual fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It occurs when a mutual fund claims to be actively managed but largely mirrors a market index, while still charging the [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | high fees]] of an actively managed fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Investors pay for supposed expert decision-making but receive performance similar to a much cheaper ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Example: TD Canadian Equity Fund
The TD Canadian Equity Fund, a $7.4 billion fund marketed as actively managed, closely tracks the S&P TSX Composite Index while charging a high MER of 2.19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

*   **Underperformance**: Over 10 years, this fund returned 6.87% annually, significantly trailing the index's 8.59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Excessive Fees**: Its 2.19% MER drastically reduces returns compared to a low-cost Canadian index ETF like XIC, which charges 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Low Active Share**: A low turnover rate of 12% indicates the fund makes few bold investment decisions, yet charges active management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

An investor with $100,000 in this fund would have missed out on over $20,000 in potential gains over 10 years, all while paying steep management fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Prevalence in Canada
Canada has a notable issue with closet indexing, with approximately 37% of assets in Canadian equity mutual funds invested in closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. A Morningstar study also found that many actively managed Canadian mutual funds have low active share scores, meaning they deviate minimally from their benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Identifying Closet Indexers
To identify closet indexers:
*   **Compare Holdings**: If a fund's stock allocations are nearly identical to a benchmark ETF, it suggests high fees for no added value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Examine Long-Term Returns**: Funds with performance that closely tracks an index while charging higher fees are likely closet indexers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Check Turnover Rate**: A low turnover rate (under 20%) implies minimal trading and active decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Consider Tracking Error**: If a fund's returns consistently match the index year-over-year, it's likely a closet indexer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Alternatives to High-Fee Mutual Funds

If holding [[Mutual Funds and Underperformance | underperforming]] or [[high_fees_on_mutual_funds_and_closet_indexing | high-fee mutual funds]], it's beneficial to explore more transparent and cost-effective alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>:

*   **Switching from Series A to Series F Funds**: Series A funds, commonly sold by banks, include hidden advisor fees. Series F funds are a lower-cost version without embedded advisor commissions, typically accessible through discount brokerages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **ETFs**: These offer significantly lower MERs (starting at 0.05%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a> and often outperform mutual funds due to their lower-fee approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Low-Fee Mutual Funds**: While rare in Canada, a few actively managed funds exist with reasonable MERs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **DIY Stock Investing**: For those comfortable managing their own portfolio, direct investment in individual stocks and ETFs can be a lower-cost option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors**: Automated investment platforms like Wealthsimple provide diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers**: For those seeking active management, professional portfolio managers can offer customized strategies with all-in fees typically ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% (depending on portfolio size), often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) survivorship pension provides financial support to eligible spouses or common-law partners after the death of a CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This pension can offer up to $818 a month for survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Eligibility for the CPP Survivorship Pension

To qualify for the CPP survivorship pension, specific requirements must be met:
*   **Relationship Status**: The applicant must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **CPP Contributions**: The deceased must have contributed to CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for a total of at least 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

It is important to apply for the survivorship pension as soon as possible after a partner's death, as retroactive payments are limited to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Delays can result in missed payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## [[factors_that_affect_cpp_payout_amounts | Factors Affecting Survivorship Pension Amounts]]

The amount of CPP survivorship pension received depends on two key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:
1.  Your age at the time of your spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  The amount your spouse contributed to the CPP over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Calculation Scenarios Based on Survivor's Age

The calculation method for the survivorship pension varies based on the survivor's age when their spouse passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

#### Survivor Under 65 Years Old
If the survivor is under 65, they receive a flat rate amount plus a percentage of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   For 2024, the flat rate is $227 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   This is combined with 37.5% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

**Example**: If the deceased would have received $1,200 per month in CPP at age 65, a survivor under 65 would receive 37.5% of $1,200 ($450) plus the $227 flat rate, totaling $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

#### Survivor 65 Years or Older
If the survivor is 65 or older, their survivorship pension is recalculated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They will receive up to 60% of the deceased's calculated pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   Unlike those under 65, survivors 65 and older do not receive the flat rate portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

**Example**: If the deceased's CPP retirement pension was calculated at $1,200 per month, a survivor aged 65 or older would receive 60% of $1,200, which is $720 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Impact of Deceased's Age on Pension Calculation

The CPP survivorship pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of their actual age at passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   If a person passed away at age 60, their retirement pension is still calculated as if they had lived until 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Similarly, if a person passed away at age 70, the pension is still calculated based on what they would have received at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Therefore, the survivor's pension amount ($677 for those under 65 or $720 for those 65 or older in the examples provided) remains consistent regardless of the deceased's age at death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The key takeaway is that the survivor's pension is based on the amount the deceased would have received at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Average and Maximum CPP Survivor Benefits

Based on real-life data:
*   **Survivors Under 65**: The average payment is $524 a month, with a maximum of $739 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This includes both the flat rate and 37.5% of the deceased spouse's pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Survivors 65 and Older**: The average payment is $323 per month, with a maximum of $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. These survivors receive 60% of their spouse's pension without the flat rate portion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

The difference between average and maximum payments suggests that many survivors do not receive the full pension, often due to the deceased spouse's contribution history or the survivor's own CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Maximum payouts are only achievable if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Maximum Survivor Pension Cap Explained

There is a cap on the total CPP benefits an individual can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of CPP benefits and the survivorship pension cannot exceed the maximum CPP retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Examples of Combined Benefit Caps

*   **Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension**:
    *   If a survivor receives $800 a month from their own CPP retirement pension and qualifies for $700 per month from a survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   Due to the retirement cap of $1,375 (in 2024), their benefits would be reduced to that cap amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   If the survivor's CPP retirement pension is $400 a month and they qualify for $600 per month from the survivorship pension, their combined total of $1,000 a month is below the cap, so they would receive the full $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   **Disability Pension Combined with Survivorship Pension**:
    *   If a survivor receives $1,200 per month from CPP disability benefits and qualifies for $500 a month from a survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   However, due to the combined survivor and disability pension cap at $1,613 per month, their total benefits would be adjusted to $1,613 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Advanced Planning Strategies for the CPP Cap

Financial planning can help maximize benefits when facing the CPP cap:
*   **Start CPP Early if Below the Cap**: If your CPP retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting CPP early might be a good option. This allows collection of both your CPP and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   For example, if your CPP is $400 a month and your survivorship pension is $500 per month, the combined $900 is well below the $1,375 retirement cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Delay CPP if Near the Cap**: If your expected CPP is close to the maximum, delaying your CPP can maximize your overall benefit. This way, you receive a higher survivorship pension without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   For instance, if your CPP at 65 is $1,000 a month and your survivorship pension is $600, the combined $1,600 already exceeds the $1,375 cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Delaying CPP to age 70 will increase your CPP benefit later while still allowing you to receive the full survivorship benefit from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Duration of Survivorship Pension

The CPP survivorship pension is received for life as long as the survivor is alive, with no time limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Remarriage**: Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility; the pension will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Death of Survivor**: Payments will cease upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## How to Apply for the Survivorship Pension

Applying for the survivorship pension is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Complete the application on the Government of Canada's website and provide supporting documents such as the spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. It is crucial to apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on payments, as there is only a 12-month retroactive window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Related CPP Benefits

### CPP Children's Benefit
If the deceased parent was a CPP contributor, their children may be eligible for the CPP children's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit provides financial support to biological and adopted children of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Amount**: For 2024, the benefit is a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is not based on the earnings of the parent or spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **Eligibility**: Children must be under 18 years old, or between 18 and 25 and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Application**: Applications can be submitted through Service Canada, requiring documents such as the child's proof of enrollment if they are between 18 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### CPP Death Benefit
The CPP death benefit is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In some cases, it may be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This benefit helps cover immediate expenses like funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits

All CPP benefits, including the survivorship pension, child benefit, and death benefit, are taxable income and must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

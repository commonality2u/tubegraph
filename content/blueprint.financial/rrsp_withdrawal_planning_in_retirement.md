Many Canadians regret not properly planning their [[rrsp_withdrawal_strategies_for_retirement | RRSP withdrawals]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This can lead to higher taxes, loss of government benefits, and forced withdrawals that do not align with their financial needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Unexpected Tax on Withdrawals

A common regret is underestimating the unexpected tax implications of [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Unlike TFSAs, every [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawal]] is considered fully taxable income, which can significantly affect a retiree's income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

*   **Example**: David, who earns $40,000 from CPP and a pension, withdraws $50,000 from his [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP]] for home renovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This increases his taxable income to $90,000, leading to a much larger tax bill than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: David could have reduced his tax burden by withdrawing smaller amounts over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Forced Withdrawals at Age 71

By age 71, [[rrsp_to_rrif_conversion_process | RRSPs must be converted into a RRIF]] (Registered Retirement Income Fund) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. [[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_structured_withdrawals | RRIFs require mandatory withdrawals]] each year, whether the retiree needs the income or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

*   **Example**: Michael has $500,000 in his [[rrsp_to_rrif_conversion_process | RRSP]] when he turns 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Under current rules, he must withdraw close to 5% ($26,400), increasing his taxable income to $76,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. As he ages, higher withdrawal rates are forced upon him, compounding the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Losing OAS Benefits to [[optimizing_tfsa_withdrawals_in_retirement | RRSP Withdrawals]]

Large [[optimizing_tfsa_withdrawals_in_retirement | RRSP withdrawals]] can push retirees over income thresholds, leading to the clawback or elimination of Old Age Security (OAS) payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. For example, in 2024, OAS begins to be clawed back at around $91,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Many regret not spreading out withdrawals earlier to avoid losing thousands in government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> [[rrsp_flexibility_and_withdrawal_challenges | RRSP withdrawals]] are not easily accessible like a regular bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Every dollar withdrawn is taxed as income, often pushing individuals into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Additionally, [[rrsp_flexibility_and_withdrawal_challenges | RRSP withdrawals]] permanently reduce contribution room, unlike TFSAs where contribution room is restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> Before contributing to an [[rrsp_flexibility_and_withdrawal_challenges | RRSP]], consider if you will need access to the money before retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. If so, a TFSA or another type of account might be a better choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. However, when used strategically for long-term retirement savings, an [[rrsp_flexibility_and_withdrawal_challenges | RRSP]] can be a powerful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The key is to plan ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

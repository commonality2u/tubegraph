Examining average [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] savings by gender reveals interesting trends in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Overall Gender Trends
Women generally tend to save more in their [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSAs]] than men at nearly every age range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This occurs despite a persistent income gap in Canada where men earn an average of 36% more than women as of 2022 (men earning $66,000 compared to women earning $48,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This suggests that women may be prioritizing savings and making strategic financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Factors contributing to this could include more conservative spending habits, a focus on long-term security, and potentially lower-risk investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. These trends indicate that how one saves can be more impactful than income earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Age-Specific Trends

### Under 20
For Canadians under 20, women have an average [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] balance close to $4,000, while men's average is around $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This early lead for women is notable given that both groups likely have limited incomes at this age, suggesting women might be more inclined to start saving early and develop strong financial habits sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Early 20s (20-24)
The trend of women saving more continues in the 20 to 24 age group, with women holding an average of about $7,000 compared to approximately $6,000 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Late 20s (25-29)
The gender gap persists into the late 20s. Women's average [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] balance reaches about $12,264, while men's is approximately $10,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### 30s
By their 30s, the gap between men and women's [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] balances nearly closes. In the 30 to 34 age group, men slightly edge ahead, holding an average of $13,920 compared to women's $13,716 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This temporary shift could be influenced by the gender income gap becoming more prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### 40s and 50s
As Canadians move through their 40s and 50s, women begin to pull ahead once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **40-49:** Women hold an average of about $20,680 compared to $20,640 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **50-54:** Women lead with an average of $27,000, while men have around $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This period may reflect a more conservative approach to spending and saving, along with an increased focus on long-term financial security as retirement nears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 60s
The gender gap in [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] savings remains in their 60s. Women aged 60 to 64 hold about $40,240, while men have approximately $39,180 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This could be influenced by factors such as longer life expectancy for women and a more cautious withdrawal strategy in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Implications for Savings
The data suggests that despite earning less on average, women maintain higher average [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This highlights that smart financial habits can enable individuals, even those with lower incomes, to build significant long-term wealth through vehicles like the [[average_tfsa_balances_by_age_range_in_canada | TFSA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

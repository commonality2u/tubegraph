When examining [[average_tfsa_balance_by_age_group_in_canada | average TFSA balances]] by gender, data reveals that women generally tend to save more than men in their Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSAs) at nearly every age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This trend is particularly surprising given the existing income gap in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Early Adopters: Under 20

Among Canadians under 20, women exhibit an average TFSA balance of close to $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, while men in the same age group have an average of about $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This difference is notable, especially since both groups likely have limited income sources at this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It suggests that women may be more inclined to start saving earlier and develop robust financial habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## The 20s: A Persistent Gap

The trend of women saving more continues into the early 20s. For the 20 to 24 age group, women save approximately $7,000 on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, compared to about $6,000 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This gender gap in TFSA savings persists into the late 20s (ages 25 to 29), with women's balances reaching around $11,264 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, while men's balances are approximately $10,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## The 30s: A Brief Shift

By the time Canadians reach their 30s, the TFSA gender gap nearly closes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. In the 30 to 34 age group, men slightly edge ahead, holding an average of $13,920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, compared to women's $13,716 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This brief shift could be attributed to the gender income gap beginning to play a more significant role in savings ability during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Mid-Life and Approaching Retirement: Women Pull Ahead

As Canadians move through their 40s and 50s, women start to pull ahead in TFSA savings once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

*   **Ages 40-49:** Women hold an average of about $20,680 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, compared to $20,640 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Ages 50-54:** Women lead with $27,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, while men have around $25,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

This renewed lead for women may reflect a more conservative approach to spending and saving, along with a heightened focus on long-term financial security as [[role_of_TFSA_in_retirement_planning | retirement]] approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Retirement Years: Sustained Lead

The gender gap in TFSA balances remains in the 60s. Women aged 60 to 64 hold about $40,240 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, compared to $39,182 for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This sustained lead could be linked to factors like women's longer life expectancy and a more cautious [[optimizing_tfsa_withdrawals_in_retirement | withdrawal strategy]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The Income Gap vs. Savings Habits

Despite the well-known income gap in Canada—where men earned an average of 36% more than women in 2022 ($66,000 for men vs. $48,000 for women) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>—women consistently maintain higher average TFSA balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

This surprising finding suggests that women may be prioritizing savings and making strategic financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Factors contributing to these higher balances might include:
*   Conservative spending habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
*   A strong focus on long-term financial security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Potentially lower-risk [[success_stories_and_challenges_with_tfsa_investments | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>

These trends highlight that how one saves can often be more significant than how much one earns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Women demonstrate that consistent, smart financial habits, even with lower incomes, can lead to substantial long-term wealth accumulation through vehicles like the TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

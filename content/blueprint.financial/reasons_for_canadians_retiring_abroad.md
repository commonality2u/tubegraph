A significant number of Canadians are choosing to leave the country permanently, with 106,000 departing in 2024. Many of these individuals are not merely seeking warmer climates but are driven by a desire to escape high costs, high taxes, and the fear of outliving their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trend extends to retirees seeking a better shot at retirement by relocating to places where their money stretches further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## [[Challenges of retirement in Canada | Challenges of Retirement in Canada]]

Living in Canada is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The average Canadian retiree receives approximately $1,300 to $1,500 per month combined from CPP and OAS if they start at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This amount, while potentially sufficient decades ago, is often inadequate for current living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

In Toronto, for instance, a one-bedroom apartment averages about $2,100 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. When factoring in utilities ($200), groceries ($400), and a transit pass ($150), monthly expenses can easily exceed $3,000 for someone who doesn't own a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. CPP and OAS benefits barely cover a third of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Numbeo data suggests a single person in Toronto spends about $1,500 per month without rent, escalating to $3,500 to $4,000 with a one-bedroom apartment, just for a modest lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This financial strain makes retirement in Canada feel like "running on a treadmill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Consequently, many Canadians are either delaying retirement or seeking more viable options abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## The Financial Advantage of Retiring Abroad

Moving to a country with a lower [[Cost of living considerations for Canadian retirees | cost of living]] allows Canadian retirement savings and benefits to stretch significantly further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Case Study: Seth's Retirement Plan

Consider Seth, who retires in 2025 at age 65 with a net worth of $281,000 after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

*   **Retiring in Toronto**: If Seth lives in Toronto, spending $50,000 annually and relying on CPP and OAS ($18,000 annually) plus RRSP and TFSA withdrawals:
    *   By age 70, his TFSA is drained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   By age 72, he relies solely on RRSP withdrawals ($46,000+ per year), with effective tax rates above 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   By age 74, he is out of savings, and his net worth turns negative by age 76 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This scenario demonstrates how high costs in a city like Toronto can quickly deplete a "decent nest egg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **Retiring in Cancun, Mexico**: In contrast, if Seth retires in Cancun, Mexico, where a single person's monthly expenses (including rent) are around $1,700 CAD ($20,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
    *   CPP and OAS cover most expenses, requiring only small investment withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   His portfolio grows: $387,000 by age 70, $586,000 by age 80, and over $900,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This illustrates the "potential power of location," allowing wealth building in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

*   **Retiring in Porto, Portugal**: If Seth chooses Porto, Portugal, a more upscale European option with monthly expenses around $3,000 CAD ($36,000 per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>:
    *   His savings drop to $199,000 by age 75 and just over $100,000 by age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   He runs out of money by age 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While this offers a "better runway than Toronto," it's still not enough for a long retirement, especially when planning until age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   Small adjustments, like delaying CPP to age 70 and drawing RRSP earlier, could extend his savings by two years, to age 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Retiring Abroad

While the financial benefits are clear, there are crucial factors to consider when planning to retire outside Canada.

### [[Impact of moving abroad on Canadian retirement benefits | Old Age Security (OAS) Rules]]

A significant risk is losing OAS payments if you retire abroad without meeting specific residency rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Qualification in Canada**: To qualify while living in Canada, you need 10 years of Canadian residency after age 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Receiving Payments Abroad**: If living outside Canada, you need 20 years of Canadian residency to keep receiving OAS long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **The 6-Month Rule**: If you have between 10 and 20 years of residency, you might only receive OAS for 6 months after leaving Canada, unless you move to a country with a social security agreement with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. For example, David, with 15 years of Canadian residency, moved to Thailand (which has no social security agreement) and lost his OAS after 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Understanding these [[rules_and_considerations_for_retaining_canadian_benefits_while_living_abroad | rules]] is vital to avoid losing earned income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Other Important Notes
*   **Research Costs**: Use tools like Numbeo to compare costs of rent, food, and utilities in potential retirement destinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Planning**: Do not rely solely on CPP and OAS. Factors like inflation, currency shifts, and unexpected healthcare costs can significantly impact your budget, especially in developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Life abroad isn't for everyone. Challenges include distance from family, adapting to new systems, and language barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **[[Tax implications for Canadian retirees abroad | Tax Implications]]**: Be aware of potential tax traps when leaving Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

A low-cost retirement abroad can be rewarding, but it requires a solid financial plan that considers costs, taxes, and potential "what-ifs" to ensure you don't run out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Home ownership plays a significant role in enabling earlier retirement, particularly for Chinese Canadians. Owning a home, especially one that is mortgage-free by retirement, reduces financial burdens and provides greater security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## High Home Ownership Rates

Data indicates a high rate of home ownership among Chinese Canadians:
*   **Overall Ownership**: 85% of Chinese Canadians live in owner-occupied homes, significantly higher than the national average of 73% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Mortgage-Free at Retirement**: Approximately one out of three Chinese Canadians near retirement age are mortgage-free, compared to just one in four overall Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Income Levels**: This trend holds true across income levels; Chinese home ownership exceeds 73% even for households earning less than $50,000, according to CMHC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Financial Advantages in Retirement

Being a homeowner, particularly without a mortgage, offers substantial financial benefits in retirement:
*   **Reduced Income Needs**: If there are no rent or mortgage payments, retirees do not need as much income to maintain their lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Less Necessity to Work**: Seniors who rent are much more likely to continue working out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For instance, 19% of immigrant men who rent still work out of necessity, compared to only 14% of homeowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Financial Freedom and Security**: A paid-off home contributes to more freedom, less financial stress, and a stronger sense of security in later life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Cultural Priority and Strategy

For many Chinese families, home ownership is a significant cultural priority:
*   **Early Goals**: Families often set "stretch goals" early in life to purchase a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Payoff**: They tend to live modestly and aggressively pay off their mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **"Front-Loaded" Investment**: This strategy is likened to carrying a heavy backpack uphill early in life, allowing one to "coast downhill later during retirement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Challenges
It's acknowledged that achieving early home ownership and mortgage payoff was "a lot easier to do in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s than it is today in the unfortunate housing crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

The emphasis on home ownership and mortgage payoff is a key part of the [[importance_of_financial_planning_for_retirement | financial planning]] that enables many Chinese Canadians to achieve early retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Self-employed individuals, who often lack company pensions, also frequently build wealth through strategies like aggressively saving and buying property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

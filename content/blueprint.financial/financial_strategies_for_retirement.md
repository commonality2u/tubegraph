Thinking about how to best manage your finances for a secure retirement involves considering various [[retirement_planning_and_financial_strategies | financial strategies]], particularly regarding government pensions like the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Delaying the start of your CPP payments could be a significant financial decision for your retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article outlines several reasons why deferring your CPP might be a beneficial [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | strategy for securing your financial future in retirement]].

## Key Reasons to Delay CPP Payments

### 1. Increased Monthly CPP Benefits
Delaying your CPP significantly boosts your monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, if the baseline amount at age 65 is $1,000 per month, starting at:
*   **Age 60:** Reduces benefits by 0.6% per month, totaling a 36% reduction, resulting in $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Age 70:** Increases benefits by 0.7% per month, totaling a 42% increase, resulting in $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
Delaying to age 70 can more than double the monthly benefit compared to starting at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### 2. Sufficient Existing Income or Savings
If you possess enough income or savings from ages 60 to 70, delaying CPP is a viable [[retirement_planning_and_financial_strategies | strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Drawing from sources like RRSPs, TFSAs, or workplace pensions allows your investments to continue growing while you defer CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This approach can lead to higher guaranteed income in your 70s and beyond, enhancing your [[strategies_for_securing_financial_future_in_retirement | financial stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### 3. Good Health and Longevity
If you are in good health and expect to live longer than average (a 60-year-old in Canada is expected to live to about 85) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, delaying CPP is advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Starting at 60 locks in a lower monthly amount for life, which might not suffice if you live longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. CPP payments last for the rest of your life once started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The breakeven point for earning more by delaying from age 65 to 70 is around 81 or 82 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 4. Inflation Protection
The CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning your payouts will increase to keep pace with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For instance, in 2024, the CPP rate increased by 4.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Delaying CPP means your larger indexed payments will be even more substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This inflation-indexed feature is a unique and valuable aspect of the Canadian government's pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### 5. Confidence in CPP Management
The CPP is well-funded and at a very low risk of being underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Contribution Growth:** Contributions are projected to grow significantly, ensuring substantial cash flow into the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Sustainability:** Regular independent reviews have determined the CPP to be financially sustainable for at least the next 75 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Investment Returns:** The CPP's Investment Portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% as per the 2023 annual report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### 6. Avoiding OAS Clawback
Delaying CPP can help you avoid the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. OAS payments can be up to $784 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, but are subject to clawbacks if your income exceeds certain thresholds (e.g., $90,997 as of the latest figures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. If your total income, even with delayed and higher CPP payments, remains below this threshold, you can receive full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### 7. No Need for Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)
If you anticipate having a higher income in retirement from sources like RRSPs or work pensions, you likely won't qualify for the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. In such cases, delaying CPP and receiving larger payments won't affect your eligibility for GIS, as you wouldn't qualify anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 8. RSP Tax Planning
Delaying CPP until age 70 can facilitate RSP tax planning, allowing you to draw down your RRSP quicker between ages 60 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This strategy minimizes RRSP taxes upon death, potentially leaving a larger estate for your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

#### Example: Managing Expenses with RSP Withdrawals and Delayed CPP
*   **Ages 60-70:** If annual living expenses are $40,000, you can withdraw $40,000 annually from your RRSP to cover these costs, reducing your RRSP balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Age 70 Onward:** With annual CPP benefits kicking in at $21,000, you would only need an additional $19,000 annually from other sources (remaining RRSP, TFSA, work pensions) to meet your $40,000 expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This strategy enables you to pay less tax upon death and leave a larger estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### 9. Still Working in Your 60s
If you plan to continue working into your 60s or 70s, you likely won't need the CPP income early on, making it easier to delay for additional payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Moreover, if you continue working, you'll still contribute to CPP from age 60 to 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. The benefit from delaying CPP is likely greater than trying to achieve similar returns by investing early CPP payments in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### 10. More Predictable and Stable Income
By delaying CPP, you trade uncertain investment returns for a guaranteed increase in your CPP payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Instead of relying on fluctuating market performance, you secure a higher, inflation-adjusted CPP payment for the rest of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Personalizing Your CPP Decision
While delaying CPP offers many advantages, the optimal decision for when to start CPP payments depends entirely on your personal [[retirement_planning_and_financial_strategies | financial situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. You must evaluate various factors based on your unique circumstances to make the best choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

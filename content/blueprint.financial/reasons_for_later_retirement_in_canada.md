The concept of retiring at 65, which was viable when houses cost around $80,000 and most people didn't live past 75, is becoming less feasible in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Today, individuals may live 30 or more years in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Without adequate planning, there's a risk of running out of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. As a result, more Canadians are working beyond age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Shifting Retirement Trends

In the late 1990s, Canadians were retiring earlier, with the average retirement age dipping to 60.9 years in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, this trend began to reverse:
*   By 2010, the average age increased to 62.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   By 2020, it reached 64.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   In 2024, the average retirement age climbed to 65.3 years, marking the highest point in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This represents a four-year increase in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Furthermore, the median retirement age now exceeds 65, indicating that more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The reasons for working varied:
*   Approximately 12% worked by choice to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   About 9% worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
More than half of retirees working past 65 did so by choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Retirement ages also differ by employment sector:
*   Public sector employees tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Private sector workers typically retire around 65 and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Self-employed Canadians retire latest, averaging nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Key Reasons for Later Retirement

Six primary reasons contribute to Canadians working longer and retiring later:

### 1. Increased Life Expectancy
Canadians are living longer than in the past, which significantly impacts retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy increases as one ages:
*   At age 40, the average Canadian man is expected to live to 78, and women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   At age 50, men are projected to live to 79, and women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   At age 60, men are looking at about an 80.5-year life expectancy, and women at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   If you hit 70, men reach about an 83.2 life expectancy, and women at 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
A healthy 65-year-old can expect two or more decades ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Retirement is no longer a 10-year plan but a 20 to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and health management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### 2. Changes in Pension Coverage
Defined benefit pensions, which offered a predictable, employer-backed income for life, are becoming less common, particularly in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Private sector workers are more likely to have defined contribution plans, where [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | retirement income]] depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Only 37.5% of paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The majority must rely on personal savings like [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | RRSPs]] and [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | TFSAs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without matching income boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Shelter costs** were up 6.2% year-over-year as of February 2024, with mortgage interest rates jumping over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Food prices** have risen over 20% since 2020 and continue to climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Healthcare costs**, such as dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions, are out-of-pocket expenses that increase with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
Making ends meet on a fixed income, especially while renting, carrying debt, or supporting family, is increasingly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. [[tax_implications_for_retiring_alone_in_canada | Taxes]] can also significantly reduce income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 4. Less Physical Work
Historically, physical jobs like construction or manufacturing meant bodies often mandated retirement by 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Now, more Canadians work in knowledge-based or service jobs, often at a desk or from home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job is not physically demanding and mentally engaging, there's less incentive to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Work provides structure, identity, and social connection, and many older adults feel energized by their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
A generational mindset shift is occurring, where retirement is viewed less as an escape and more as freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Freedom doesn't necessarily mean never working again; it can involve part-time consulting, teaching, freelance gigs, or starting a dream business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Retirement is often seen as a gradual transition rather than an abrupt halt at 65, allowing for more flexible and personally fulfilling engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" is quietly reshaping retirement timelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The rising number of Canadians over 50 getting divorced often leads to significant financial resets, including selling a house, splitting assets, paying legal fees, and needing to support two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Even a solid couples' retirement plan may be insufficient for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Starting over in life often entails new expenses and fewer years to rebuild savings, leading many to delay retirement, downsize, or re-enter the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## The Impact of Uncertainty

Uncertainty is a significant factor in delaying retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Even with sufficient savings on paper, market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation (still higher than many retirees plan for) create hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Rising healthcare costs and geopolitical tension add to general anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Canadians often delay retirement not out of necessity, but to achieve peace of mind and feel financially secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Relying on [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]], [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | OAS]], and savings feels riskier, as one unforeseen event (market dip, medical emergency, rent hike) could derail an entire plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This leads people to work longer, delay tapping into savings, and build a larger buffer for comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

However, time is a retiree's most valuable asset, and it becomes more valuable the less you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Retiring as early as safely possible allows for more healthy years to live and enjoy life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## Financial Planning Scenarios: Keanu's Case Study

To illustrate how [[strategies_for_determining_retirement_needs_in_canada | financial planning strategies]] can impact retirement, consider Keanu, a 65-year-old single individual aiming for a modest lifestyle spending $50,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He earned $90,000 annually before retirement, owns a paid-off home, and has $400,000 in his [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | RRSP]] and $100,000 in his [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | TFSA]], but no corporate pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | OAS]] are assumed to start at 65 unless otherwise noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Retiring Cold Turkey at 65
If Keanu retires at 65, immediately collects [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | OAS]], and lives off his savings, he would run out of money by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | RRSP]] would deplete quickly, and his [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | TFSA]] wouldn't cover the remaining years, leading to a negative net worth by his mid-80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This assumes no major health or inflation surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Working Three More Years
If Keanu works three more years, earning $90,000 annually and continuing to save, while still taking [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | OAS]] at 65, his money would easily last through age 90, leaving him with an estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Just three extra years of work provide over a decade of financial breathing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Working Two More Years & Delaying CPP (Suboptimal)
In this version, Keanu works two more years, but instead of starting [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]] at 65, he waits until 70 to lock in a higher monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Despite the higher [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]], a shortfall occurs because he aggressively draws from his [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | RRSP]] between ages 67 and 69 to cover the gap, draining it too quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Scenario 4: Working Two More Years, Delaying CPP, and Strategic RRSP Withdrawals
This strategic approach involves Keanu retiring at 67 and delaying [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]] until 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Crucially, he draws gradually from his [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | RRSP]] between ages 67 and 69, just enough to cover his needs while keeping [[tax_implications_for_retiring_alone_in_canada | taxes]] low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This results in a steady [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | income]] throughout retirement, a lower lifetime [[tax_implications_for_retiring_alone_in_canada | tax]] bill, and a sizable estate of over $500,000 remaining by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This combination of working two years, delaying [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]], and strategically drawing from his [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | RRSPs]] achieves the necessary financial balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

Even simple examples like these highlight the power of the right sequencing of payments and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. By tweaking a few levers like timing [[retirement_income_sources_in_canada | CPP]], drawing down smartly, and working a bit longer, individuals can build a functional retirement plan without needing to double their savings or work until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

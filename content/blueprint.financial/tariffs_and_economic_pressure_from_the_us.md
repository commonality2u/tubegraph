New tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on imports from Canada have significantly impacted the Canadian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This latest trade dispute adds considerable pressure to the Canadian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Economic Impacts and Policy Implications

The tariffs contribute to an environment where the proposed capital gains tax hike becomes "even less likely" to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. With businesses and investors already anticipating economic fallout, the Canadian government may need to prioritize defending Canadian industries over proceeding with an unpopular tax increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The threat of these tariffs could also encourage businesses and investments to move south, away from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The presence of the "Trump tariffs" is cited as one of the factors contributing to an estimated 80% chance of a full reversal of the capital gains tax increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, alongside other [[legal_and_political_challenges_to_tax_hikes | legal and political challenges]].

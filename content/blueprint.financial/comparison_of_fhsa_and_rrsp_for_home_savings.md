The First Home Savings Account (FHSA) is a new account in Canada that, in most cases, is more beneficial to contribute to first compared to a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) for saving for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the FHSA often comes out on top, there are two key situations where the RRSP is still advantageous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Saving for a Home: FHSA vs. RRSP

### First Home Savings Account (FHSA)
With the FHSA, individuals can contribute up to $8,000 per year, with a lifetime maximum of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. When a home is purchased, the full amount can be withdrawn tax-free, and no repayment is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This provides greater financial freedom and less stress in the early years of home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For example, if Paul contributed the maximum of $40,000 to his FHSA over 5 years, he could withdraw the entire sum tax-free when buying his home, with no obligation to repay it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
In comparison, the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan (HBP) allows for a tax-free withdrawal of up to $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. (This limit was recently increased from $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.) However, the key difference is that the withdrawn amount must be repaid over 15 years, with repayments starting 5 years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Missing a repayment adds that amount to the individual's taxable income for the year, increasing their tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Winner for Saving for a Home: FHSA
The FHSA is the winner for saving for a home because it offers tax-free withdrawals and no repayment obligations, providing peace of mind, especially for first-time home buyers who want to avoid the financial stress of repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Down Payment Potential: FHSA vs. RRSP

### FHSA
The FHSA offers significant potential for growing a down payment. If Paul contributed $8,000 annually to his FHSA for 5 years, totaling $40,000, and achieved a 6% annual rate of return, his account could grow to approximately $45,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. If he left the money invested for an additional 10 years, his FHSA could grow to about $80,000, providing a much larger tax-free down payment when he buys a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### RRSP Home Buyers' Plan
With the RRSP Home Buyers' Plan, Paul could withdraw up to $60,000 tax-free, but this is a fixed limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Unlike the FHSA, the RRSP withdrawal for a home is capped at $60,000, and it must be repaid over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Winner for Down Payment Potential: FHSA
The FHSA is the winner for down payment potential due to its greater flexibility and the potential for a larger tax-free down payment, especially if the funds are not needed immediately for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## [[tax_benefits_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | Tax Benefits]]: FHSA vs. RRSP

### FHSA
The FHSA offers a clear tax advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Contributions are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an upfront tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. The significant benefit of the FHSA is that when funds are used to buy a first home, the withdrawal is completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This results in a double tax advantage: tax savings at contribution and again at withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, contributing $8,000 to an FHSA might save around $2,000 in taxes, and if the account grows to $10,000, the entire $10,000 can be withdrawn tax-free with no repayment required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### RRSP
RRSP contributions are also tax-deductible, offering upfront savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. If the HBP is used, up to $60,000 can be withdrawn tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, this amount must be repaid over 15 years, and any missed repayments are added to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. While the withdrawal for a home under the HBP is tax-free initially, it functions more like a tax-free loan from the RRSP, as the funds will eventually be taxed when fully withdrawn from the RRSP in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Winner for Tax Benefits: FHSA
The FHSA is the winner for tax benefits, providing upfront tax savings, tax-free withdrawals, and the flexibility of no repayment, making it a simpler and more efficient option for home buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## [[investment_potential_in_fhsa_and_rrsp | Investment Potential]]: FHSA vs. RRSP

Both the FHSA and RRSP provide excellent investment opportunities, allowing investments in a wide range of options such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. A key benefit of both accounts is tax-deferred growth, meaning taxes are not paid on investment gains as they grow, enabling compounding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Although the FHSA is labeled a "savings account," it functions like both a savings and an investment account, allowing for strategic investments with potential for significant growth, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Winner for Investment Potential: Tie
Since both the FHSA and RRSP offer the same investment potential and allow for tax-deferred growth with similar powerful investment opportunities, there is no clear winner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The main difference lies in how funds are withdrawn, not how they are invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## [[retirement_savings_considerations_with_fhsa_and_rrsp | Retirement Savings]]: FHSA vs. RRSP

While the RRSP might seem like the primary choice for retirement savings due to its higher contribution limits and retirement focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, the FHSA offers a flexible and powerful alternative, even for those not planning to buy a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Individuals can contribute up to $40,000 to an FHSA and have up to 15 years to use the funds for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. A key feature is that if a home is not purchased within that 15-year period, the FHSA balance can be transferred into an RRSP without losing any tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This means the FHSA can essentially act as a bridge to the RRSP, offering the same growth potential with added flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The RRSP allows for higher annual contributions, up to 18% of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. However, starting with the FHSA provides more flexibility, allowing for tax-free withdrawals for a house, or if plans change, a simple transfer of funds into an RRSP without penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Winner for Retirement Savings: FHSA
The FHSA is the winner here because it provides tax-free withdrawals for a home and the flexibility to roll funds into an RRSP, making it an ideal starting point for both first-time home buyers and long-term retirement planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## [[situations_where_rrsp_is_advantageous_over_fhsa | Situations where RRSP is Advantageous]]

There are two specific situations where the RRSP is a smarter choice over the FHSA:

1.  **Investing in US Stocks**: When investing in US stocks through an FHSA, any dividends earned are subject to a 15% withholding tax, which can significantly reduce returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, with an RRSP, this tax is avoided due to the US-Canada tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Therefore, it is recommended to invest in US stocks through an RRSP to bypass this withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

2.  **Employer Matching**: An RRSP advantage is employer matching contributions, which essentially provides free money to boost retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if an employer matches RRSP contributions up to $5,000 per year, contributing $5,000 results in an additional $5,000 from the employer, totaling $10,000 for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Currently, the FHSA does not offer employer matching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Winner for Specific Situations: RRSP
The RRSP takes the lead for long-term investors and those with strong work benefits when it comes to avoiding US dividend taxes and leveraging employer matching benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Overall Conclusion

Overall, even if one is not saving specifically to buy a home, the FHSA typically wins in most categories over the RRSP, offering greater flexibility, advantages for home savings, and tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. The only times it might make more sense to prioritize an RRSP are when heavily investing in US dividend stocks or when receiving employer matching RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

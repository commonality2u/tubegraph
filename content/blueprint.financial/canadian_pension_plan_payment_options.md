Deciding when to start your [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]] payments is one of the most impactful [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement choices]] you can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin receiving [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 can potentially add over $100,000 in lifetime benefits for many individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This decision is part of a complex [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement puzzle]], requiring consideration of factors like life expectancy, investment returns, and other income streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] Basics and Payment Adjustments

Most Canadians claim [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at age 60, with over 70% starting their benefits at either age 60 or 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. However, there are options to start between ages 61 and 64, and between 66 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

*   **Starting Early (Age 60)**: Choosing to start [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at age 60 reduces payments by 0.6% per month before age 65, leading to a 36% lifetime reduction from the age of 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Delaying (Age 70)**: Waiting until age 70 boosts payments by 0.7% per month after age 65, resulting in a 42% increase in monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For example, if someone qualifies for $1,000 per month at age 65, they would receive $640 per month at age 60 (a steep reduction) and $1,420 per month at age 70 (significantly more income later in life) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Insights from an Actuarial Report

A detailed 2020 actuarial study on [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] take-up decisions provides key insights into optimal start ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at 60
This option is generally best for those who:
*   **Need immediate income** or have health concerns leading to a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Are **high-return investors**: If investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at 60 allows for investing the payments and potentially coming out ahead, albeit at higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Have **GIS and OAS considerations**: Starting at 60 can help avoid clawbacks for low-income retirees, smoothing income across retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

!> **Drawbacks**: Starting at 60 comes with a permanent 36% reduction in lifetime payments compared to starting at 65, which significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those who live beyond age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Starting [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at 65
This default option strikes a balance, providing steady payments and avoiding the need for savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's ideal for retirees with below-average to average life expectancy and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Predictable income**: Offers reliable, inflation-adjusted income without requiring additional planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Break-even analysis**: Payments equalize with the 70 option around age 80, making 65 a reasonable middle ground for those unsure of longevity or returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

!> **Tradeoffs**: Leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] to 70
Delaying provides the highest guaranteed lifetime income, with payments increasing by the maximum amount and being inflation-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for those with longer life expectancies and sufficient savings to bridge the income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Longevity protection**: Payments continue for life, ensuring secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **High effective return**: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to around 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Break-even age**: For most, delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments start to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Estimating Your Life Expectancy

Your predicted life expectancy is a crucial factor in deciding when to take [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Odds of Living Past Age 80 (2020 [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] Report)
*   **Gender differences**: Women tend to live longer than men. 82% of women are likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Longevity expectations**: A healthy lifestyle or family history of long life increases the odds (79% for men, 85% for women), making delayed [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Delaying often pays off**: The majority of Canadians are expected to live past 80, even with low longevity expectations, suggesting most retirees benefit from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Stats Canada Life Expectancy Data
More recent data from Stats Canada shows that the older you are, the longer your life expectancy becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Longer than realized**: Conventional wisdom often estimates life expectancy around 80 or 82, but it's often higher for middle-aged individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Women benefit more from delaying**: Women consistently live longer across all age groups, often reaching their late 80s or 90s, making delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] to age 70 particularly beneficial for higher inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Men should balance longevity with needs**: Men with shorter life expectancies may still find delaying worthwhile but should carefully consider their health and financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Longevity insurance**: Delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] acts as a safety net, especially for women, who are more likely to face financial strain in later years due to longer lifespans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic planning**: Integrating [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] timing with strategies like RSP withdrawals ensures optimized [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement income]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Online Life Expectancy Calculators
Several online calculators can provide estimates based on age, gender, lifestyle choices (smoking, diet, exercise), family medical history, and current health status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Blue Zones Vitality Compass**: Focuses on lifestyle habits inspired by regions known for longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It's quick (about 5 minutes) and offers actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Living to 100**: Based on the New England Centenarian Study, this tool dives deeper with detailed questions about health and habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. It's more comprehensive (10-20 minutes) and provides personalized feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

While these calculators offer tailored outlooks compared to general statistics, results can vary (e.g., by 4 years), so they should be taken with a grain of salt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Methods to Refine Life Expectancy Estimates
For a deeper dive, consider:
*   **Genetic testing**: Uncover potential health predispositions and longevity factors based on your DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Lifestyle evaluations**: Identify modifiable risk factors like diet, exercise, and stress management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Biological age testing**: Advanced tests measuring aging at a cellular level for a more precise estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive health screenings**: Regular checkups for chronic conditions like heart disease or diabetes, which significantly impact longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It's recommended to start these annually in your 30s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Using a [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] Present Value Calculator

Instead of solely relying on [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] break-even tables, which don't consider factors like investment rate of return or the present value of money, a [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] present value calculator is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The "TaxTips CPP Retirement Pension Calculator" is a useful tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Users can input:
*   Estimated monthly benefit at age 65 (e.g., $1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Estimated annual indexation of [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] (inflation rate, e.g., 2.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   Desired start ages for evaluation (e.g., 60, 65, 70) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   Estimated life expectancy (e.g., 86 for a woman in her 50s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   Estimated rate of return on investments (e.g., 2-6%, typically 3-5% for conservatism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

The calculator provides the present value of choosing [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at different ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Impact of Variables
*   **Rate of Return**: A higher rate of return can significantly narrow the present value gap between starting ages, potentially making earlier take-up more competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Life Expectancy**: Longer life expectancies strongly favor delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] to age 70, leading to much higher present values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Conversely, a shorter life expectancy (e.g., passing away early at 72) clearly favors taking [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Inflation Rate**: Fluctuations in the inflation rate can greatly impact the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. High inflation tends to make delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] more advantageous due to its inflation-adjusted nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

It's important to remember that while cumulative payments for delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] might be significantly higher, the present value difference accounts for the time value of money, providing a more realistic comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Holistic Income Coordination]]

Deciding when to start [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] is a complex puzzle where careful planning can unlock significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. A comprehensive approach to [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | CPP planning]] considers:
*   **Scenarios and Break-even points**: Analyzing how long you're likely to live and when delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] starts to pay off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Tax Strategies]]: Understanding how [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] income interacts with your overall [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | tax situation]] to potentially reduce or increase your tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Mitigation**: Determining if delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] can help avoid this penalty, or if starting earlier is a better option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Holistic Income Coordination]]: Integrating [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] with RSP withdrawals, TFSA savings, and other [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | retirement income sources]] to create the most efficient [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Most often, delaying [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_and_its_international_considerations | CPP]] into the late 60s or 70s proves beneficial, though exceptions exist based on individual scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

This article details the [[income_thresholds_for_top_earners_in_canada | income thresholds]] required to be among the top 10%, 5%, and 1% of earners in Canada, emphasizing the significant [[differences_between_median_and_average_rrsp_savings | differences between median and average incomes]] within these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Top 10% Individual Income Earners

As of 2022, an individual needed to earn at least $111,900 in total income to join the top 10% of earners in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Within this group:
*   The median income was $147,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   The average income was $197,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

By 2022, the average income for the top 10% was over $50,000 higher than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This disparity illustrates how a small number of ultra-high earners can significantly lift the average, indicating a growing concentration of income at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. For example, billionaires like Jim Patterson, with an estimated net worth over $11 billion, considerably skew the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

From 2018 to 2022, the entry threshold for the top 10% increased by 14.3%, rising from $97,000 to approximately $111,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This segment of earners demonstrated economic resilience, experiencing substantial income growth despite major events like the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The data suggests a widening of income inequality in Canada, as both median and average incomes in the top 10% grew faster than national [[average_income_in_canada_by_age | income averages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Life for a top 10% earner, exemplified by a 37-year-old engineer earning $120,000 per year, is often stable and comfortable, allowing for manageable expenses, a good family life, and automation of savings like RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Top 5% Individual Income Earners

To enter the top 5% category in Canada, a total income of at least $147,100 was required as of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Within this group:
*   The median income was $193,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   The average income was $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The average income for the top 5% was over $75,000 more than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, further indicating increasing income concentration at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The minimum income to reach this group rose by 16.3% between 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The top 5% of earners are significant tax contributors, paying an average of $87,700 in income taxes in 2022 and contributing over 41% of all federal and provincial personal income taxes, despite making up only 1 in 20 taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Membership in this group is consistent, with about 76% remaining in the top 5% from the previous year, and 86% having been in the group at least once in the prior five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

The [[lifestyle_and_financial_habits_of_top_earners | lifestyle and financial habits of top earners]] in this category, such as a 45-year-old senior policy analyst earning $160,000, include dual incomes, disciplined savings, maxing out RRSPs and TFSAs, and investing extra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This allows for lifestyle freedom, including private schooling for children, international vacations, and dining out without financial stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Top 1% Individual Income Earners

To reach the top 1% level in Canada, an individual needed to earn at least $283,200 in total income in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Within this group:
*   The median income was $388,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   The average income was $586,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The average income for the top 1% was nearly $200,000 higher than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This vast difference clearly shows how much income is concentrated among the ultra-elite, particularly the top 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The threshold for the top 1% jumped by 15.7% from 2018 to 2022, with median incomes rising by nearly 14.7% and average incomes by 18.3%, outpacing both inflation and broader wage growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

The top 1% earners also make heavy tax contributions, paying an average of $231,600 in income taxes in 2022 and contributing over 22% of all federal and provincial income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This group demonstrates significant income stability, with approximately 69% remaining in the top 1% from the previous year, and 96% having been in the top 5% at least once in the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

Life for a top 1% earner, such as a 48-year-old running a successful marketing agency and earning over $350,000 per year, involves owning multiple properties, supporting children in private school and competitive activities, and international travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Most of their wealth is held in holding companies invested in real estate, stocks, and private deals, managed by an advisory team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Despite the [[benefits_of_higher_income | benefits of higher income]], it often comes with a demanding schedule and complex financial management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Median vs. Average Across Income Groups

When comparing the top earners to the [[average_income_in_canada_by_age | average Canadian income]], a stark contrast emerges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. The median income for most Canadians ranges between $35,000 and $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Even the highest median income by age group (45 to 54 years old at $51,500) is still well below the top 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The top 5% threshold ($147,100) is more than double what most Canadians earn, and entering the top 1% requires nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34-year-old earns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Regardless of income level, [[the_importance_of_net_worth_over_income | income is just the start]]; it is what one does with it that builds freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The story of Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through consistent investing despite a low salary, highlights this principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

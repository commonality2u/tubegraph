When an individual plans to leave Canada permanently and become a non-resident, it is crucial to understand how their Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) will be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Careful financial management is necessary to avoid significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Contributions and Withdrawals

As a non-resident of Canada, certain rules apply to your RRSP:
*   **Contributions**: You can still contribute to your RRSP if you have available contribution room from Canadian-earned income, even while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. However, without Canadian income, you will not generate new contribution room as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals**: Any withdrawals made from your RRSP as a non-resident are subject to a 25% Canadian withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This rate may be reduced if a tax treaty exists between Canada and your new country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Tax Implications

Your RRSP investments will continue to grow tax-deferred in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains within your RRSP, depending on its specific tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Tax Treaties

The impact of taxation on your RRSP varies significantly from country to country, with some tax treaties offering relief or exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **United States Example**: If you move to the U.S., the U.S. will generally not tax the incoming gains within your RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Other Countries**: For other countries, taxation depends on their specific tax treaty with Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Canada maintains tax treaties with 91 different countries, including common destinations like Mexico, Costa Rica, and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. It is always essential to understand the tax rules of the country you are moving to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Managing Your RRSP While Abroad

You can keep your RRSP account open and manage your investments even as a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees, as these can impact your overall returns if you plan to withdraw funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## RRSP to RRIF Conversion

As a non-resident, you have the option to convert your RRSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Rules**: Withdrawals from your RRIF will be subject to similar withholding tax rules, typically 25%, unless a tax treaty reduces this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Minimum Withdrawals**: Minimum withdrawals from your RRIF are based on your age and the fund's value, just as they would be if you were living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **United States Example**: The tax treaty between Canada and the U.S. can reduce the withholding tax rates on RRSP/RRIF withdrawals to 15% for periodic withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The specific tax treaty of the country you move to will determine the exact rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Returning to Canada

If you decide to return to Canada and become a resident again, you can resume contributing to your RRSP based on any new Canadian income and available contribution room you generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

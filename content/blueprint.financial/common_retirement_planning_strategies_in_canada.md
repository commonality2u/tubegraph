Determining the exact amount needed for retirement is a common question, and the answer largely depends on an individual's unique situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article explores four common strategies Canadians use to figure out their target retirement number.

## The Pitfalls of a Failed Retirement

Properly figuring out retirement savings is crucial to avoid a "failed retirement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. A common risk is running out of money before the end of one's life, known as "risk of ruin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Without sufficient funds, individuals may struggle to cover essential expenses like housing, healthcare, and daily living, potentially losing financial independence and having to rely on family or government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Case Study: Vincent's Shortfall
Vincent retired at age 60 with $400,000 in savings, planning to withdraw $40,000 annually, expecting his investments to grow and his savings to last 15 years before relying on [[retirement_income_system_in_canada | government pensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However:
*   By year five, his savings dropped to $200,000 due to withdrawals, minor investment losses instead of gains, and an unexpected home repair expense of $50,000, leaving him with $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   By year ten, his savings were completely depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   With annual expenses of $40,000 and income only from [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | OAS]] covering $25,000, Vincent faced a $15,000 annual shortfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Common Retirement Planning Strategies

### 1. The "Do Nothing" Strategy
This is the simplest, yet riskiest, approach to retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. A shocking number of Canadians, over half (52%), feel they are behind on their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Even more concerning, 20% of those aged 55 to 64 have no money set aside for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This "ostrich head in the sand" method involves ignoring the problem and hoping it will resolve itself, often leading to having to work beyond planned retirement age or relying on minimal government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. Rules of Thumb
These methods provide a good starting point for retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

*   **Age-Based Savings Target**: This rule suggests accumulating a multiple of your current salary by certain ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>:
    *   By age 30: 1 year of current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
    *   By age 40: 3 times current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>
    *   By age 50: 6 times current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>
    *   By retirement age: 8 to 10 times current salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
    *   *Example*: Earning $60,000 annually, one should aim for $60,000 by age 30, $180,000 by age 40, and $480,000 by age 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **The 4% Rule**: This rule suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings each year to avoid running out of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For example, with $1 million saved, one could withdraw $40,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This provides a buffer in case investments do not perform as well as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Percentage of Pre-Retirement Income**: A common guideline is to aim for 70-80% of pre-retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Some prefer 80-90% as a starting point to account for surprise expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. For example, if earning $100,000 pre-retirement, planning for an annual retirement income of $80,000-$90,000 is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Household Expenditure Statistics**: Data from Statistics Canada in 2021 indicates the average annual expenditure for Canadian households aged 65 and older was around $61,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. For those aged 40-54, this number was significantly higher at $120,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, suggesting expenses often drop considerably by retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Financial planners often observe retirees spending $3,000-$7,000 per month for singles and $5,000-$9,000 for couples, depending on lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pros of Rules of Thumb:
> *   **Simplicity**: Straightforward and easy to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
> *   **Quick Estimates**: Provide a rapid sense of savings needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
> *   **Rough Guideline**: Offers a starting point for planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Cons of Rules of Thumb:
> *   **Oversimplification**: Do not account for personal circumstances, inflation, or unexpected expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
> *   **Risk of Running Out of Money**: Relying solely on these rules can lead to shortfalls if expenses exceed expectations or investments underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
> *   **Lack of Flexibility**: Do not adapt well to changes in lifestyle or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### 3. Online Retirement Calculators
Many online calculators help Canadians determine retirement needs, providing a quick and easy way to assess retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Users typically input age, income, savings, planned retirement age, and expected spending, and the calculator outputs a readiness assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

*   **Canada.ca Retirement Calculator**: Provided by the government, it is thorough and considers many factors, but can be time-consuming and requires detailed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Wealthsimple Retirement Calculator**: Easy to use with a clean interface and quick to fill out, but may lack detail compared to more comprehensive tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Sun Life Retirement Calculator**: Balances ease of use with a fair amount of detail, making it a good middle-ground option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pros of Online Calculators:
> *   **Accessibility**: Easy to find and use online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
> *   **Quick Estimates**: Provide a rapid snapshot of retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
> *   **Basic Guidance**: Offer initial guidance on achieving retirement goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Cons of Online Calculators:
> *   **Lack of Detail**: Some may not provide the depth of analysis needed for a comprehensive plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
> *   **User Experience**: Tools like Canada.ca's can be cumbersome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
> *   **Assumptions**: Often rely on generalized assumptions that may not fit personal situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
> *   **Limited Scope**: Might not consider factors such as [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | tax implications]], healthcare costs, or lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
> *   **User Error**: Incorrect inputs or oversight can lead to false confidence in retirement readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### 4. Comprehensive Financial Planning
For the most thorough determination of retirement needs, hiring a fee-for-service financial planner to use planning software is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This approach treats retirement planning as a complex math problem with many variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

#### A 6-Step Process for Comprehensive Planning:

1.  **Initial Consultation**: A one-on-one video consultation to understand financial goals, current situation, retirement aspirations, risk tolerance, and specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This step is critical for tailoring a plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
2.  **Detailed Data Collection**: Gathering specific Canadian financial details, including:
    *   Income and expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>
    *   Savings and investments, like [[retirement_savings_plan_and_home_buyers_plan_in_canada | TFSA]] and [[retirement_savings_plan_and_home_buyers_plan_in_canada | RRSP]] accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>
    *   Debts and liabilities (mortgages, credit card debt, loans) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>
    *   Government benefits such as [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | CPP]] and [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | OAS]] entitlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>
    *   Employer pensions ([[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | RPPS]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>
    *   Expected retirement age and desired lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
    This information builds a comprehensive picture of financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
3.  **Comprehensive Financial Strategy Development**: Developing a tailored strategy that includes:
    *   [[retirement_tax_strategies_in_canada | Tax optimization]]: Optimizing TFSA and RRSP contributions/withdrawals, considering income splitting and pension income credits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   Investment management: Assisting in creating a diversified portfolio with Canadian and international assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   Retirement expense planning: Considering different phases of retirement spending (higher spending initially for travel, moderate middle years, lower later years with potential healthcare cost increases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
    *   [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | Government benefits integration]]: Strategically planning when to take [[diversifying_retirement_income_beyond_cpp | CPP and OAS]] to maximize benefits, considering early retirement reductions and deferral increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
    *   Estate planning: Ensuring assets are distributed according to wishes, including wills and tax implications of RSP/RRIF withdrawals upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
4.  **Stress Testing**: Modeling for different scenarios to account for challenges such as market volatility, longevity (living longer than expected), inflation, and unexpected major expenses (e.g., home repairs, family financial support) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
5.  **Implementation Assistance**: Helping set up investment accounts, adjust saving plans, and working with other professionals like tax advisors or estate planners to ensure smooth implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
6.  **Ongoing Monitoring and Adjustments**: Retirement planning is not a one-time event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Regular reviews and adjustments are made based on changes in life or financial situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Pros of Comprehensive Financial Planning:
> *   **Customization**: Tailored to specific needs and goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
> *   **Comprehensiveness**: Covers all aspects of financial life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
> *   **Adaptability**: Adjusts to changing circumstances and plans for many different scenarios and strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Cons of Comprehensive Financial Planning:
> *   **Complexity**: Can be more complex and time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
>   **Cost**: Professional planning services involve fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.
> *   **Assumptions**: Still relies on assumptions, and drastic changes can occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

While no plan can perfectly predict the future, a detailed approach helps significantly reduce uncertainty and provides peace of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## The "Magic Dollar Amount" for Retirement

The idea that $1.7 million is always needed for retirement in Canada is often not true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. The required amount largely depends on individual lifestyle and desired retirement quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Some retirees manage comfortably with $500,000 in low-cost areas, while others in higher-cost areas typically need at least $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Lavish spenders may require several million dollars and still come close to depleting their savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

Understanding personal needs and planning accordingly, while factoring in "wiggle room" for unexpected events, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

The traditional retirement age of 65 is becoming less common in Canada. While this age was suitable when houses were significantly cheaper and life expectancy was shorter, today's realities mean many Canadians are working past 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This shift is driven by a combination of economic, social, and demographic factors, leading to a significant increase in the average retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Shifting Retirement Landscape

Canadians are [[increasing_average_retirement_age_in_canada | retiring later]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. In 1997, the average retirement age dipped to 60.9 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, this trend reversed:
*   **2010**: The average age crept up to 62.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **2020**: It reached 64.3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   **2024**: The average retirement age has climbed to 65.3, marking the highest it has been in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

This represents a four-year jump in less than one generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The median retirement age is also now over 65, indicating that more than half of retirees are leaving the workforce after this age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Why Canadians are Working Longer

In 2022, 21% of Canadians aged 65 to 74 were still employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, but not all for the same reasons:
*   **By Choice**: About 12% chose to work to stay active, connected, and fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Financial Necessity**: Another 9% worked out of financial necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The trend of working longer varies by sector:
*   **Public Sector**: Employees tend to retire earlier, around age 63 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Private Sector**: Workers typically hold out until about 65.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Self-Employed**: Self-employed Canadians retire on average at nearly 69 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Six Key Reasons for Delayed Retirement

There are six primary reasons contributing to the trend of Canadians working longer and [[increasing_average_retirement_age_in_canada | retiring later]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### 1. Longer Life Expectancy
While good news, living longer significantly impacts retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Life expectancy increases as one gets older:
*   **Age 40**: Average Canadian man can expect to live to 78, women to 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Age 50**: Men projected to live to 79, women to 84 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Age 60**: Men 80.5, women 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Age 70**: Men 83.2, women 86.9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

A healthy 65-year-old can expect two or more decades ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Retirement is no longer a 10-year plan but a 20- to 30-year lifestyle, requiring more funding and management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### 2. Changes in Pension Coverage
Historically, many Canadians relied on defined benefit pensions, providing predictable lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. However, these are becoming less common, particularly in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Defined contribution plans are more prevalent, where retirement income depends on investment performance, placing more risk and responsibility on the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Only 37.5% of all paid workers in Canada are covered by a workplace pension, meaning the majority must plan their retirement through personal savings like RRSPs and TFSAs <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### 3. Rising Cost of Living
Today's retirees face surging costs without matching income boosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This contributes to the [[cost_of_living_considerations_for_canadian_retirees | challenges of retirement in Canada]].
*   **Shelter Costs**: As of February 2024, shelter costs were up 6.2% year-over-year, and mortgage interest costs alone jumped over 26% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Groceries**: Food prices have increased over 20% since 2020 and continue to rise, impacting those on fixed incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: While public healthcare is free, out-of-pocket expenses for dental, glasses, physio, and prescriptions can be significant and rise with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

It's harder to make ends meet when living off CPP, OAS, and savings, especially with rent, debt, or family support obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Rising costs, coupled with taxes, can significantly reduce available funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 4. Less Physical Work
In the past, many jobs were physically demanding, leading to retirement by 65 due to bodily strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Now, a larger proportion of Canadians work in knowledge-based or service jobs that are less physically taxing, often involving desk work or remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If a job isn't physically demanding and one remains mentally sharp, there's less incentive to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Many find work energizing, providing structure, mental activity, and financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### 5. Changing Views on Retirement
There is a generational mindset shift where retirement for boomers and Gen Xers is less about escape and more about freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Freedom doesn't necessarily mean never working again; it can involve part-time consulting, teaching, freelance gigs, or starting a passion business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Retirement is often seen as a gradual transition rather than a hard stop, allowing for a more flexible and personally fulfilling lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Work also provides structure, identity, and social connection, which many retirees miss, leading them to reshape their work rather than abandon it entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### 6. Divorce and Late-Life Breakups
"Gray divorce" (divorce among those over 50) is rising, significantly impacting retirement timelines and financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Late-life separations often necessitate a major financial reset: asset splitting, legal fees, and the need to support two households instead of one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. A couple's solid retirement plan may be insufficient for an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Starting over often involves new expenses, potentially a new mortgage or rent, and fewer years to rebuild savings. Consequently, many delay retirement, downsize, or re-enter the workforce to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## The Impact of Uncertainty

Uncertainty is a significant factor contributing to delayed retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Even with sufficient savings, market volatility, unpredictable housing costs, and inflation (still higher than many expect) create hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Adding healthcare costs, geopolitical tension, and general anxiety about the future, it's understandable that many Canadians delay retirement for peace of mind, not just necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Relying on a fixed income (CPP, OAS, savings) feels riskier than before; a market dip, medical emergency, or rent hike could derail an entire plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. To counter this, many work a few more years, delay tapping into savings, and build a larger financial buffer for comfort and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Strategic Retirement Planning

While delaying retirement provides financial security, it comes at the cost of valuable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Strategic [[common_retirement_planning_strategies_in_canada | retirement planning strategies in Canada]] can help bridge this gap.

Consider Keanu, a 65-year-old single individual with $400,000 in an RRSP, $100,000 in a TFSA, and a paid-off home, aiming for a $50,000 annual spending goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Scenario 1: Immediate Retirement at 65**: If Keanu retires immediately at 65 and starts collecting CPP and OAS, he runs out of money by age 83 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. His RRSP depletes quickly, and his TFSA cannot cover the remaining needs, leading to negative net worth in his mid-80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Scenario 2: Work 3 More Years**: If Keanu works three more years (earning $90,000 annually) while continuing to save, and still takes CPP and OAS at 65, his money easily lasts through age 90, with a net estate of over $400,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Just three extra years of work buy him over a decade of financial breathing room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

*   **Scenario 3: Work 2 Years, Delay CPP to 70 (Aggressive RRSP Draw)**: Keanu works two more years but delays CPP until 70 for a higher monthly benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, aggressively drawing from his RRSP between 67 and 69 to fill the income gap drains it too quickly, leading to a shortfall in later years despite stronger CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

*   **Scenario 4: Work 2 Years, Delay CPP to 70 (Gradual RRSP Draw)**: Keanu retires at 67 and delays CPP to 70, but this time, he draws gradually from his RRSP between 67 and 69, just enough to cover needs while keeping taxes low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This strategy results in a steady income, a lower lifetime tax bill, and a sizable estate remaining over $500,000 by age 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. This combination of working two years, delaying CPP, and strategically drawing from RRSPs achieves financial balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

These examples highlight how crucial the right sequencing of payments and withdrawals can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Small adjustments like timing CPP, smart withdrawal strategies, and working a bit longer can build a workable retirement plan without doubling savings or working excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

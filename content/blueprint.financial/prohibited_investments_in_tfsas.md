Your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is not a free-for-all; it has clear restrictions on what can be invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) aims to prevent individuals from using TFSAs as a tax loophole for personal ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, ensuring they remain tools for legitimate, arms-length investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Types of Prohibited Investments

Investments that are not permitted in your TFSA include:
*   **Significant Interest Holdings** Investing in or owning 10% or more of a private company's shares is prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Non-Arms Length Relationships** Investments in businesses where you or your family have significant control or influence are also banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Penalties for Prohibited Investments

The [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | penalties for prohibited investments]] are severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>:
*   **50% Special Tax** If your TFSA acquires a prohibited investment, you will face a tax equal to 50% of the fair market value of the investment at the time it was acquired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **100% Tax on Income and Gains** Any income or capital gains earned from [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | prohibited investments]] are taxed at 100%, effectively nullifying any benefit from holding these investments in your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Common Example of a Prohibited Investment

Consider an example where you invest $10,000 in a private tech startup owned by a relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. If this business grows and your shares become worth $50,000, the CRA could deem the investment prohibited due to your close connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The result would be a 50% tax on the $50,000 value ($25,000), and the shares must be removed from your TFSA, meaning any future gains will no longer be tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## How to Stay Safe

To avoid [[strategies_to_avoid_tfsa_penalties | TFSA penalties]] related to prohibited investments, consult the CRA's guidelines and review their list of qualified investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Given the steep [[tfsa_banned_investments_and_cra_penalties | penalties]], it is crucial to invest only in qualifying assets to protect your TFSA as a powerful wealth-building tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

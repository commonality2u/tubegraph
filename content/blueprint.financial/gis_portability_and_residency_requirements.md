The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is a monthly benefit designed to support low-income seniors residing in Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> However, its portability is limited, making it a critical consideration for Canadians planning to [[important_tax_and_residency_rules_for_canadians_retiring_abroad | retire abroad]].

## GIS Portability: The Hard Truth

Unlike other Canadian retirement benefits, the GIS is **not portable** if you move outside Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

*   **Residency Requirement:** The government explicitly states that if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months, your GIS payments will stop. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> This rule applies even if your income remains low and you continue to file Canadian taxes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   **Government Statement:**
    > "According to the Government of Canada, your guaranteed income supplement payments can stop if you leave Canada for more than six consecutive months." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   **No Social Security Agreements:** There are no social security agreements that protect your GIS payments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> GIS is strictly tied to your physical presence in Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> Even if you meet the income threshold, GIS will not follow you abroad. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>

### Case Study: Gan's Experience

Gan, a 71-year-old retiree, moved to Mexico and was receiving both CPP and GIS. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> A few months into her move, her GIS was terminated because she was outside Canada for more than six months, automatically disqualifying her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>

### Implications for Retirement Planning

If GIS is a critical part of your retirement income, it is essential to consider this rule before relocating. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> You may need to:
*   Delay your move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>
*   Adjust your budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>
*   Explore other income options to replace the lost benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

## Maintaining Residency for GIS (Snowbird Strategy)

Some retirees employ a "snowbird" strategy to maintain part-year residency in Canada, thereby preserving their health care and tax status. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> This involves spending winters in warmer climates but ensuring they do not stay outside Canada for more than 183 days in a calendar year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> This strategy allows them to continue receiving GIS.

## Summary of GIS Behavior When Moving Abroad

The GIS is described as a friend who "just loves Canada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> and will "totally ghost you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> once you leave Canada for more than six months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> There is no treaty, no workaround, and no goodbye for GIS when you become a non-resident. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>

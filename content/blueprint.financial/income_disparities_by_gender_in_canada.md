In Canada, a notable income gap exists between men and women. Understanding this disparity involves examining average and median incomes, as well as the underlying factors contributing to the difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Income Statistics (2022)

As of 2022, income statistics reveal a clear gap:
*   **Men**: Earned an average of $66,000 with a median income of $49,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Women**: Earned an average of $48,500 with a median income of $37,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

This translates to men having a 36% higher average income and a 32% higher median income compared to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Factors Contributing to the Gender Income Gap

Several factors contribute to the persistent [[income_disparity_and_challenges_in_canada | gender income gap]] in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>:

*   **Occupational Segregation**: Men often work in higher-paying fields, such as finance and engineering, while women are more frequently employed in lower-paying sectors like education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.
*   **Work Hours and Career Interruptions**: Men tend to work more full-time hours and experience fewer career interruptions, which can significantly boost their overall earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.
*   **Systemic Barriers**: Biases in hiring and promotions act as systemic barriers, making it more challenging for women to advance in their careers and increase their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.
*   **Negotiation and Transparency**: Men are often more likely to negotiate for higher pay. A lack of transparency around salaries can also help perpetuate the existing gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

## Addressing the Gap

While there is no easy solution, women might consider strategies such as negotiating pay more aggressively or targeting industries that are actively working to close this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

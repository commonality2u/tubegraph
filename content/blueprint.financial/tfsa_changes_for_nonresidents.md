When planning to permanently leave Canada and become a non-resident, your finances, including your Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), will be significantly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It is crucial to manage your finances carefully to avoid losing significant amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## TFSA Account Status for Non-Residents

Upon becoming a permanent non-resident of Canada, your [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] is subject to several important changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Positive Aspects
*   **Tax-Free Status in Canada:** Your [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] maintains its tax-free status in Canada, even if you become a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals:** You can continue to withdraw funds from your [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] while living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These withdrawals will be added back to your contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Repatriation:** If you return to Canada as a resident, you can resume normal [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] activities, including making contributions up to your available room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Restrictions and Penalties
*   **[[rules_regarding_tfsa_contributions_by_nonresidents | No New Contributions]]:** You cannot make new contributions to your [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] while you are a non-resident of Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Your existing [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] can remain open and continue to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **[[penalties_and_taxation_of_tfsa_by_the_cra | Penalties for Contributions]]:** If you contribute to your [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] while a non-resident, you may face penalties of 1% per month on the contributed amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   For example, a $5,000 contribution could incur a $50 monthly penalty, totaling $600 over a year, significantly reducing investment benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **[[tfsa_contribution_limits_for_2025 | No Contribution Room Accumulation]]:** You do not accumulate new [[tfsa_contribution_limits_for_2025 | TFSA contribution room]] for any years during which you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Remember, you also cannot use the contribution room generated from withdrawals until you become a resident of Canada again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Tax Implications Abroad

While the growth within the [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] remains tax-free in Canada, your new country of residence may tax the income or gains from your [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] according to its own tax laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

*   **Example: Moving to the US:** The United States does not recognize the [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]], so the IRS will tax all income and gains from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This often surprises individuals moving to the US, making it advisable to collapse the account before moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   It is crucial to be aware of the tax rules of the country you are moving to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Pro Tip for Your TFSA Before Leaving

Consider maximizing your [[tfsa_contribution_limits_for_2025 | TFSA contribution]] before you leave Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This strategy allows your existing investments to continue growing tax-free while you are abroad, especially since you cannot contribute any more once you are a non-resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Important Considerations

It is crucial to consult with a cross-border tax professional, ideally one specializing in both Canadian and your destination country's tax laws, to understand the specific implications for your situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The 2025 pension updates include significant changes to the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), particularly impacting higher earners through what is known as the CPP enhancement program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These changes are designed to help higher earners save more for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Unified Payment Schedule for 2025

For 2025, the Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for CPP, Old Age Security (OAS), and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Payments for all three will be received on the same day, typically in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the money will be received earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Setting up direct deposit through a My Service Canada account is recommended for convenience and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## CPP Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA)

CPP payments are adjusted annually to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For 2025, the adjustment is 2.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. For example, a monthly CPP payment of $1,000 in 2024 would increase by $26 to $1,026 in 2025, helping retirees maintain their purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## [[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_changes | CPP Enhancement]]: The Two-Tier System

A significant change for 2025 is the introduction of a two-tier CPP system, also known as the [[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_changes | CPP enhancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This system requires higher earners to contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Tier 1: Base CPP (BCPP)

*   **Applies to**: Earnings up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE), which is $71,500 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Contribution Rates**:
    *   **Employee**: 5.95% of eligible earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   **Employer**: Matches the employee rate at 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   **Self-Employed**: Pays both portions, totaling 11.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Tier 2: Enhanced CPP (CPP2)

*   **Applies to**: Earnings between the YMPE ($71,500) and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE), which is $81,400 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Contribution Rates**:
    *   **Employee**: 4% of eligible earnings within this range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Employer**: Matches the employee rate at 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Self-Employed**: Pays both portions, totaling 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Contribution Caps and [[Impact of CPP enhancements on different income levels | Income Examples]]

Total contributions are capped. For 2025, the maximum CPP contribution is $4,420 for incomes exceeding $81,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It's important to note that the first $3,500 of earnings is exempt from CPP calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Here are examples of employee CPP contributions at various income levels for 2025:

*   **$40,000 Income**: An employee would pay $2,171 in CPP, which does not reach the second tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **$80,000 Income**: An employee would pay a total of $4,388, including $348 from the CPP2 tier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **$100,000 Income**: An employee would have capped out at the maximum CPP contribution of $4,420 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### [[benefits_of_earning_more_despite_higher_taxes | Benefits for Higher Earners]]

The new two-tier system allows higher earners to save more for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. With these enhancements, CPP is projected to replace up to 33.33% of lifetime earnings, an increase from the previous 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This can be viewed as "upgrading to a premium subscription," where contributing more now leads to better payouts later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## OAS and GIS Updates (Briefly Mentioned)

While not directly part of CPP enhancements for higher earners, the video also covers updates for Old Age Security (OAS) and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS):

*   **OAS Cost of Living Adjustment**: OAS payments are reviewed quarterly, but for January to March 2025, there will be no increase due to a small dip in the CPI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. However, benefits have still grown by 2% over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **OAS Clawback Threshold**: The OAS pension recovery tax, or "clawback," applies if net income exceeds $90,997 for July 2024 to June 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Seniors must repay 15% of the excess income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Strategies like income splitting or using a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can help keep net income below this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Increased OAS at Age 75**: Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their OAS payments, a measure introduced in July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. For January to March 2025, the maximum monthly payment for those aged 65-74 is $727, while for those 75 and older, it increases to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **GIS Cost of Living and Income Thresholds**: GIS payments also adjust quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For January to March 2025, the maximum monthly payment for a single senior remains $1,086, as there was no CPI increase in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Over the past year (January 2024 to January 2025), GIS benefits have grown by 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The annual income limit for a single person to qualify for GIS for the first quarter of 2025 is $22,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

[[Tax Strategies for Investments in Canada | Tax loss harvesting]] is a strategy used to reduce taxable income by using investment losses to offset investment gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:58">[09:50:58]</a>. While it can be a bit tricky, it's a worthwhile strategy when executed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:33">[09:54:33]</a>. It shares similarities with [[Income Splitting for Tax Savings | income splitting strategies]] involving capital losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:33">[09:57:33]</a>.

## How it Works

When you sell an investment at a loss, you can use that loss to reduce the taxes on gains from other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:23">[10:00:23]</a>. If your losses exceed your gains, you have the flexibility to carry those losses forward to future years or even apply them back to previous years to obtain a tax refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:46">[10:05:46]</a>. This strategy specifically applies to non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:01">[09:31:01]</a>.

> [!example] Example of Tax Loss Harvesting
> Imagine you realized a $10,000 stock gain earlier in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:26">[10:14:26]</a>. To reduce your tax bill, you can sell another stock that is currently down by $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:34">[10:17:34]</a>. This $6,000 loss will offset part of your $10,000 gain, meaning you are only taxed on $4,000 instead of the original $10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:29">[10:25:29]</a>.

## Key Rule: The Superficial Loss Rule

A critical rule to be aware of when engaging in [[tax_strategies_for_investments_in_canada | tax loss harvesting]] is the Superficial Loss Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:26">[10:30:26]</a>. This rule can trip up many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:04">[10:33:04]</a>.

If you or your spouse repurchase the same stock within 30 days of selling it at a loss, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will not permit you to claim that loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:04">[10:33:04]</a>. Instead, the loss is added to the cost basis of your newly purchased shares, delaying the tax benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:09">[10:41:09]</a>.

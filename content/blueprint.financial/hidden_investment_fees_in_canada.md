Even for diligent investors, hidden fees can quietly reduce investment returns by thousands of dollars over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Most investors are unaware of these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Hidden Investment Taxes

Taxes can erode returns in unexpected ways, even without actively selling investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Capital Gains Distributions

You may receive unexpected tax bills from [[capital_gains_tax_deferral_in_canada | capital gains distributions]] if you hold mutual funds in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This occurs when a fund manager sells assets within the fund, triggering capital gains that are then passed on to investors, increasing their taxable income and potentially leading to surprise tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For instance, if a mutual fund manager realizes $5,000 in capital gains on a $100,000 investment, you receive a tax slip for those gains and must pay taxes, even if you haven't sold anything yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

**How to Avoid:**
*   Hold mutual funds in a TFSA or RRSP to avoid capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Use ETFs instead of mutual funds, as they are typically more [[tax_efficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax efficient]] and distribute fewer gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Foreign Withholding Taxes

[[foreign_withholding_taxes_on_canadian_investments | Foreign withholding taxes]] represent lost investment income, particularly if you invest in U.S. dividend-paying stocks or ETFs within a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The IRS automatically withholds 15% of your dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This fee is often unseen because it's deducted at the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

**Example:**
*   Holding $50,000 of Microsoft stock in a TFSA earning $1,750 in annual dividends results in the IRS withholding 15%, or $262, before you receive the payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Over 20 years, this can add up to $5,250 in lost dividends that could have been reinvested and compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

**How to Avoid:**
*   Hold U.S. stocks and ETFs in an RRSP, where withholding taxes generally do not apply due to the Canada-U.S. tax treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Use Canadian-listed ETFs that hold U.S. stocks, as some structures can reduce withholding tax exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Currency Conversion Fees (FX Fees)

Canadians investing in U.S. stocks or ETFs can lose money due to currency conversion fees (FX fees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Most brokerage firms charge an FX fee of 1.5% to 2.5% per transaction when converting CAD to USD or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These fees quickly add up and eat into investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

**Example:**
*   Converting $50,000 CAD to USD with a 2% FX fee results in an immediate $1,000 loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If you sell and convert the proceeds back to CAD, another 2% FX fee means another $1,000 loss, totaling $2,000 in currency conversion fees alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Frequent trading or rebalancing can cost tens of thousands over a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

**How to Avoid or Minimize:**
*   Use discount brokerages with much lower FX fees, such as Interactive Brokers, though it may not be the most user-friendly platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Employ "Norbert's Gambit," a tactic involving buying an interlisted stock, journaling it to the other currency, and then selling it to avoid FX fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Maintain a U.S. dollar brokerage account to trade U.S. stocks without repeated CAD to USD conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Segregated Funds (Seg Funds)

Segregated funds, often marketed as insurance-protected investments, come with [[high_fees_associated_with_canadian_mutual_funds | insanely High fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They combine elements of mutual funds and life insurance policies, offering principal protection guarantees after a set period (usually 10+ years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This perceived safety carries a significant cost in fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

**Cost of Seg Funds:**
*   Management Expense Ratios (MERs) for seg funds often exceed 3% and can approach 4%, which is far higher than standard mutual funds or ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
    *   Example: The RBC Emerging Markets Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund has an MER of 2.94% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The Manulife Global Dividend Guaranteed Income Fund has an MER of 3.69% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In contrast, an iShares TSX Indexed ETF has an MER of just 0.06% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Impact:** A $100,000 investment in a seg fund with a 3.5% MER earning 6% annually (before fees) would only grow to $163,000 after 20 years. The same investment in a low-cost ETF with a 0.06% MER would grow to approximately $317,000, almost double the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

**How to Spot a Segregated Fund:**
Many investors are unaware they own a seg fund until they are locked in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Check the fund facts document for these indicators:
*   **Maturity Guarantee:** Often 75% or 100% of your principal guaranteed after 10 or 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Higher MERs:** Typically above or close to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Estate Planning Benefits:** May offer features related to estate planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Early Withdrawal Penalties:** May have surrender charges if withdrawn early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   If an advisor offers a fund with these features, ask directly if it's a seg fund and request full details on fees and restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

**When Seg Funds Might Make Sense (Niche Cases):**
*   **Estate Planning:** Assets can go directly to beneficiaries, avoiding probate delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Creditor Protection:** Business owners can protect assets from lawsuits or bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

> [!TIP] If you need insurance benefits, consider a term life insurance policy combined with a low-cost ETF. This is often much cheaper than segregated funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Trading Fees

The costs of buying and selling investments can quietly erode returns, especially for frequent traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

### Brokerage Fees

Many Canadian brokerages charge a flat fee per trade, usually between $5 and $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. For active traders, this can add up quickly; 10 trades per month at $9.99 per trade costs close to $1,200 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Some [[underperformance_of_actively_managed_funds_in_canada | actively managed mutual funds]] also charge short-term trading fees if sold within a set period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Bid-Ask Spread

The bid-ask spread is the difference between the highest price buyers are willing to pay (bid) and the lowest price sellers are asking for (ask) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, buying an ETF at $20.10 (ask) and selling at $20 (bid) results in a 10-cent loss per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This is more impactful with lower-volume stocks and ETFs, which often have wider spreads, making them more expensive to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

**How to Reduce Trading Fees:**
*   Use low-cost or commission-free brokers like Wealthsimple Trade or Questrade for ETFs and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Minimize frequent trading and adhere to a long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   Use limit orders instead of market orders to control your buy and sell pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   Trade high-volume ETFs and stocks to reduce the effect of bid-ask spread losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Early Redemption Fees

Some mutual funds and investment products charge early redemption fees if you sell too soon after buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These "short-term trading fees" discourage quick turnover but can significantly reduce investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

**Where You'll Find Them:**
*   Generally mutual funds charge fees if sold within 30 to 90 days, typically 1% to 2% of the investment value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

**How to Avoid:**
*   Review the fund's short-term trading policies in the fund facts document before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   Example: An RBC U.S. Equity Fund's short-term trading fee is 2% of the value of units sold or switched within 7 days of buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Hold investments for longer periods to avoid triggering redemption penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Consider ETFs instead of mutual funds, as most ETFs do not charge early redemption fees, offering more flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

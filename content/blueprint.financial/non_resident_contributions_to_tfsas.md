Your TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) can incur penalties if contributions are made while you are no longer considered a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This is a common way that overcontributions can occur unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Rule
If you move abroad for work or other reasons and continue to contribute to your TFSA, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) can impose penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Non-residents are not permitted to contribute to a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Penalties
The penalty for contributing to a TFSA while living outside Canada is 1% per month on every dollar contributed during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Case Example: Jessica
Consider Jessica, who moved to the U.S. for a new job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Unaware of the rules for [[changes_to_tfsa_when_leaving_canada | non-residents]], she continued to contribute $6,000 to her TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The CRA charged her a 1% monthly penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Since she was not in Canada, she did not realize her mistake for several years, resulting in thousands of dollars in penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

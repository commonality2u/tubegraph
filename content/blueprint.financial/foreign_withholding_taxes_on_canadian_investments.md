Foreign withholding taxes can quietly diminish investment returns, often without investors realizing it because the tax is deducted at the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:55">[01:34:55]</a>. This is considered one of the biggest [[hidden_investment_fees_in_canada | hidden investment fees in Canada]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.

## How Foreign Withholding Taxes Work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>
When Canadians invest in US dividend-paying stocks or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) within a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) automatically withholds 15% of the dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. This occurs before the investor receives their payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:15">[01:52:15]</a>.

### Example: Microsoft Stock in a TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>
Consider an investment of $50,000 in Microsoft stock held within a TFSA, earning $1,750 in annual dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. The IRS would withhold 15% of that, which is approximately $262 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:39">[01:50:39]</a>. This means the investor would only receive about $1,487 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:02">[01:58:02]</a>. Over a 20-year period, this adds up to $5,250 in lost dividends, which could have been reinvested and compounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>.

## How to Avoid Foreign Withholding Taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>
Making informed account choices can save thousands in unnecessary taxes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>.

Here are strategies to minimize foreign withholding taxes:
*   **Hold US Stocks/ETFs in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP)**: Due to the Canada-US tax treaty, withholding taxes do not apply when US stocks and ETFs are held within an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:11">[02:08:11]</a>.
*   **Use Canadian-Listed ETFs**: Some Canadian-listed ETFs that hold US stocks are structured in a way that reduces exposure to withholding tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:18">[02:15:18]</a>.

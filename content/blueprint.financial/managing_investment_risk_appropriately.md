Investing should ideally help build wealth and provide peace of mind, not cause stress or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. If market declines lead to sleepless nights, constant portfolio checking, or panic about your financial future, your current mutual fund might be too risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Signs of Excessive Investment Risk

Several indicators suggest that your investment portfolio might be carrying too much risk for your comfort or financial situation:

*   **Stress from Market Declines** If a stock market dip causes worry, impulsive selling, or a loss of confidence in your financial plan, your portfolio may not align with your [[understanding_risk_and_investment_choices_for_tfsa | risk tolerance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Emotional Reactions to Market News** Taking on too much risk can result in panic selling, which locks in losses and prevents benefiting from market recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Lack of Understanding of Fund Holdings** Some mutual funds contain volatile assets or employ complex, non-transparent strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Not knowing the risk level of your investments can lead to unpleasant surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **Mismatch Between Investment Timeline and Fund Risk** If you need access to your money within a few years but hold high-risk equity funds, you risk significant short-term losses that could derail your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### The Importance of "Mental Wealth"
An often-overlooked aspect of risk is "mental wealth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Even if a risky investment performs well over time, it may not be worth the cost if it negatively impacts your ability to think clearly and stay disciplined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## How to Manage and Recalibrate Risk

To appropriately manage your investment risk and achieve peace of mind:

*   **Recalibrate Risk Exposure** Your balanced portfolio should reflect your financial goals, [[investment_strategies_based_on_risk_tolerance_and_time_horizon | time horizon]], and ability to handle volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Complete an Investor Questionnaire** Free tools from firms like Vanguard can help assess your [[comparing_risk_and_return_in_investment_strategies | risk tolerance]] and guide portfolio adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Consider More Stable Investments** If your mutual fund is too aggressive, switching to a diversified ETF portfolio or a lower volatility fund can contribute to better sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Financial Well-being Over Loyalty** Many investors remain in poor investments due to loyalty to their bank or advisor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. However, your financial future and family's well-being should always come first, not loyalty or the minor inconvenience of switching funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. If investments are not serving you, it's crucial to demand a transparent strategy that builds wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Tracking your net worth can provide key insights into your financial progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Alternatives to High-Risk Mutual Funds

If you hold high-fee, underperforming mutual funds, consider exploring more transparent alternatives with potentially lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>:

*   **Switch to Series F Funds:** If you're not receiving real advice, consider switching from a Series A fund (which includes hidden advisor fees) to a Series F fund, a lower-cost version without embedded advisor commissions. Access to Series F funds is typically through a discount brokerage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
*   **ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds):** ETFs offer much lower Management Expense Ratios (MERs), starting at 0.05% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. They provide better tax efficiency and often outperform mutual funds due to their long-term, lower-fee approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Low-Fee Mutual Funds:** While rare in Canada, a few actively managed funds exist with reasonable MERs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **DIY Stock Investing:** For those willing to manage their own portfolio, direct investment in individual stocks and ETFs can be a much lower-cost option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Robo-Advisors:** These automated investment platforms, such as Wealthsimple, offer diversified ETF portfolios at a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Managers:** For active management, professional portfolio managers can provide customized strategies with all-in fees typically ranging from 0.5% to 1.4% (depending on portfolio size), often including financial planning services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

> Most mutual funds are structured to benefit banks, not to make you wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. You do not have to accept underperformance, high fees, and poor transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

Understanding monthly spending is a common concern for individuals planning their retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article provides a [[average_spending_for_canadian_retirees | breakdown of the average spending for Canadian retirees]], what they spend their money on, and how [[factors_affecting_retirement_spending | spending changes as you move through the different stages of retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Average Spending for Canadian Retirees

The average household expenditure for Canadian retirees (aged 65 and over) is $61,800 annually, or approximately $5,150 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The largest portion of expenditures for retirees in Canada goes to shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Even with many retirees owning their homes, significant costs related to maintenance, property taxes, and utilities are still incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | budgeting for ongoing home related expenses]] even after mortgage payments have ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Here is a [[breakdown_of_expenditure_categories_for_retirees | breakdown of expenditure categories for retirees]]:
*   **Shelter**: On average, retirees spend $13,814 annually, or $1,151 per month, accounting for approximately 22.3% of their monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Food**: This category includes groceries and dining out, averaging $7,667 annually, or $639 per month, which is 12.4% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Generally lower for retirees, but still representing 8.8% of their monthly budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Despite free healthcare in Canada, healthcare sees a higher allocation due to increased medical needs as people age, accounting for 5.6% of total monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Personal Insurance and Pensions**: Takes up 5.4% of monthly spending, emphasizing the need for continued financial security in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Household Operations**: Expenses for maintaining the home add up to 5.3% of monthly spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Spending Evolution Across Life Stages

Household spending evolves significantly with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Middle-Aged Households (40-54 years)**: Spending is at its highest peak, averaging $102,646 annually or $8,554 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This rise is driven by factors such as larger homes, increased food consumption, education costs for children, and a stronger focus on saving and investing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Healthcare costs also begin to rise during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Pre-Retirement Households (55-64 years)**: Spending decreases slightly to about $99,250 annually on average, or $8,270 monthly <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Childcare expenses drop, but healthcare costs continue to rise significantly, with a greater focus on paying off mortgages and preparing for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Retired Households (65+ years)**: Spending further reduces to $61,800 annually, or $5,150 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The focus shifts to essential living costs such as housing maintenance, food, and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Transportation costs decrease as work-related travel declines, and there is less spending on luxuries, with more emphasis on necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Three Phases of Retirement Spending

Within retirement, there are typically [[strategies_for_confident_spending_in_retirement | three phases of spending in retirement]]: high spending, medium spending, and low spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Early Retirement (Ages 65-70) - High Spending Phase
In early retirement, individuals tend to have higher spending. For example, Alex, a Canadian retiree, spends about $70,000 annually or around $5,833 monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Housing**: Costs are still relatively high but reduced after mortgage payoff, though maintenance and property taxes remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Costs decrease significantly due to no more daily commutes, but vehicle maintenance and occasional travel persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Costs begin to rise due to increased medical needs and insurance premiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Food**: Slightly less is spent as dining out may decrease, and more meals are prepared at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Discretionary**: There's an enjoyment of spending on hobbies and travel, leveraging new free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Mid-Retirement (Ages 70-75) - Medium Spending Phase
As individuals move into mid-retirement, annual spending decreases. Alex's spending drops to around $60,000 annually or about $5,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Housing**: Costs stabilize or slightly decrease, potentially due to downsizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Further reductions occur as travel becomes less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Expenses continue to rise with more frequent medical care and prescriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Food**: Costs remain stable or decrease further as dietary needs may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Discretionary**: Spending on travel reduces slightly, with a greater focus on home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Later Retirement (After Age 75) - Low Spending Phase
In later retirement, annual spending typically drops further. Alex's annual spending drops to $50,000 per year or around $4,160 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Housing**: Costs remain stable due to ongoing maintenance and utilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Transportation**: Significantly lower as travel becomes rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Becomes a major expense, often including costs for long-term care services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Food**: Relatively low due to simpler dietary needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Discretionary**: Travel spending grounds to a halt, with focus shifting to community and home-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

This pattern of spending change throughout retirement is typical for many retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Real-Life Observations

Based on observations from financial professionals, there is a wide range of retirement spending patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. On average, retirees tend to spend anywhere from around $4,000 to $8,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. High-end households might spend a minimum of $5,000 to $9,000 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

However, spending can vary significantly, with some retirees managing comfortably on as little as $2,000 a month, while others spend upwards of $10,000 per month or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

A common trend is that spending tends to start at a higher range in the early years of retirement and then gradually decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Typically, there's about a 25% reduction in spending as retirees settle into their new lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. For example, if initial retirement spending is $100,000 annually, it might decrease to about $75,000 per year over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

This reduction can be attributed to several [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | factors influencing spending habits in retirement]], such as:
*   Lowering housing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>
*   Decreased need for transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   Overall lifestyle changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   Decline in spending on travel, dining out, and other leisure activities as retirees age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>

Understanding these trends can help in [[planning_a_sustainable_retirement_budget | planning a sustainable retirement budget]] by [[factors_influencing_spending_habits_in_retirement | anticipating changes in spending habits]] to ensure enough savings cover needs throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

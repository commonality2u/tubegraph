When a Canada Pension Plan (CPP) contributor passes away, their CPP benefits do not always cease, as their spouse or family may be eligible for survivor benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can include a CPP survivorship pension, CPP children's benefit, and a CPP death benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## CPP Survivorship Pension

The [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]] offers financial support to the eligible spouse or common-law partner of a deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Eligibility and Requirements
To qualify for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_requirements | CPP survivorship pension]], two main requirements must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>:
*   **Relationship Status**
    The applicant must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **CPP Contributions**
    The deceased must have contributed to the CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing, or for at least 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Application and Retroactive Payments
It is crucial to apply for the survivorship pension as soon as possible after a partner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond this period could result in lost funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, if a survivor eligible for $700 a month delays applying for 18 months, they would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The application process is straightforward, requiring completion of an application on the Government of Canada's website and providing documents like the deceased spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Benefit Amount
The amount of [[factors_determining_maximum_CPP_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]] received depends on two key [[factors_determining_maximum_CPP_benefits | factors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>:
1.  The survivor's age at the time of the spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  The amount the deceased spouse contributed to the CPP during their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

#### Scenarios Based on Survivor's Age
The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of death, regardless of their actual age of passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

*   **Survivor Under 65 Years Old**
    The survivor receives a flat rate amount (for 2024, $227) plus 37.5% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. For instance, if the deceased's pension was $1,200 per month at age 65, the survivor would receive $450 (37.5% of $1,200) plus $227, totaling $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The average payment for survivors under 65 is $524 a month, with a maximum of $739 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Survivor 65 Years or Older**
    Once the survivor turns 65, their survivorship pension is recalculated to 60% of the deceased's calculated pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. If the deceased's CPP retirement pension was $1,200 per month, the survivor would receive 60% of that, or $720 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The average payment for survivors 65 and older is $323 per month, with a maximum of $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The difference between average and maximum payments often reflects the deceased spouse's contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Maximum payouts are only possible if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Duration and Re-marriage
The [[cpp_pension_sharing_and_survivor_benefits | CPP survivorship pension]] is received for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Re-marrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility, and payments will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Payments will cease upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Maximum Survivor Pension Cap Explained
There is a cap on the total CPP benefits a person can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or [[the_cpp_disability_benefit_and_its_importance | disability pension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of personal CPP benefits and the survivorship pension cannot exceed the maximum CPP retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This is part of the [[maximum_limits_and_how_personal_CPP_benefits_affect_survivorship_pension | maximum limits and how personal CPP benefits affect survivorship pension]].

### Examples of the Cap:
*   **Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension**
    If an individual receives $800 a month from their own CPP retirement pension and qualifies for $700 a month from a survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, due to a retirement cap of $1,375, their benefits would be reduced to that cap amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. If the combined total is below the cap, the full amount is received (e.g., $400 personal + $600 survivorship = $1,000, which is below the cap) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   **[[the_cpp_disability_benefit_and_its_importance | Disability Pension]] Combined with Survivorship Pension**
    If an individual receives $1,200 per month from [[the_cpp_disability_benefit_and_its_importance | CPP disability benefits]] and qualifies for $500 a month from a survivorship pension, their combined total would be $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Due to a combined survivor and [[the_cpp_disability_benefit_and_its_importance | disability pension]] cap of $1,613 per month, their total benefits would be adjusted to $1,613 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Advanced Planning Strategies
Understanding the CPP cap can inform [[timing_of_cpp_benefits | planning strategies]]:
*   **Start CPP Early (If Below Cap)**
    If your personal CPP retirement pension is expected to be significantly below the maximum, starting CPP early might be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This allows collection of both your CPP and the survivorship pension sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. For example, if personal CPP is $400 and survivorship is $500, the combined $900 is well below the $1,375 retirement cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

*   **Delay CPP (If Near Cap)**
    If your expected CPP is close to the maximum, delaying your CPP can maximize your overall benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This approach ensures a higher survivorship pension is received without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For example, if personal CPP at 65 is $1,000 and survivorship pension is $600, the combined $1,600 already exceeds the $1,375 cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Delaying CPP to age 70 will increase your personal CPP benefit later on, while still allowing you to receive the full survivorship benefit from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## CPP Children's Benefit
The [[cpp_child_benefits_and_eligibility | CPP children's benefit]] provides financial support to children of a deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Benefit Amount
In 2024, the [[cpp_child_benefits_and_eligibility | CPP child benefit]] offers a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is not based on the earnings of the deceased or the surviving spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Eligibility
The benefit is available to both biological and adopted children of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. To qualify, the child must be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>:
*   Under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Between 18 and 25 years old and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
The benefit stops once the child turns 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Application
The application process for the [[cpp_child_benefits_and_eligibility | CPP child benefit]] is similar to the survivorship benefit, and can be completed through Service Canada. Supporting documents, such as proof of school enrollment for children aged 18-25, may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## CPP Death Benefit
The CPP death benefit is a one-time, lump-sum payment typically disbursed to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This amount can be up to $5,000, though it's typically $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This benefit aims to help cover immediate expenses like funeral costs, easing the financial burden during the initial weeks following a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits
All CPP benefits mentioned, including the survivorship pension, child benefit, and death benefit, are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Recipients must report these amounts on their tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Understanding the [[tax_implications_of_cpp_benefits | tax implications]] of these benefits can be complex, especially during emotional times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

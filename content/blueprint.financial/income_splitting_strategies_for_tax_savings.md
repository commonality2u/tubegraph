[[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | Income splitting]] is a complex but effective method for managing taxes for couples and families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach can lead to significant tax savings, with some clients achieving over six figures in reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's akin to a choreographed dance between partners, where harmony is key to avoiding higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Starting with simpler strategies before moving to more complex ones is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Strategy 1: [[using_fhsa_for_income_splitting | Using Your FHSA for Income Splitting]]

This is a lesser-known [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | income splitting]] strategy, primarily because the FHSA is new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. It's beneficial for couples where one partner has unused FHSA contribution room, and the other has maximized their tax-advantaged accounts like an RRSP or TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The FHSA allows for tax-deductible contributions, similar to an RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If one partner has maximized their accounts, they can gift money to the other partner who has FHSA room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This prevents the money from being invested in a taxable non-registered account and provides the receiving partner with a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin
Ted, who has maxed out his registered accounts, gifts $8,000 to Robin, who hasn't contributed to her FHSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

*   **Without FHSA**: Ted would invest $8,000 in a taxable account, paying $132 annually on $400 growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **With FHSA**: Robin contributes $8,000 to her FHSA, gaining a $2,400 immediate tax deduction and avoiding taxes on $400 in investment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Total Savings**: $2,532, plus all future investment growth is tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The FHSA can also be rolled over into an RRSP if not used for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Pros
*   **Double Benefit**: One partner avoids taxable investment growth, while the other gains a tax deduction and tax-free growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Tax-Free Withdrawals**: Withdrawals are tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Flexible**: If not used for a home, it can be rolled into an RRSP after 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Cons
*   **Eligibility**: The receiving partner must not have owned a home in the past four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Ownership Risk**: Gifted funds belong to the receiving partner, making them difficult to reclaim if the partnership ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Strategy 2: [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | Splitting Employer-Sponsored Pension Income]]

[[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | Pension income splitting]] allows a higher-income spouse to allocate up to 50% of their eligible pension income to a lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Eligibility depends on the type of pension and age (under or over 65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This specifically applies to employer-sponsored pension income, not CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Eligibility Rules by Pension Type and Age
*   **Before Age 65**:
    *   **Defined Benefit Pension Plan (DBPP)**: Income qualifies for [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
    *   **Defined Contribution Pension Plan (DCPP)**: Withdrawals generally do not qualify, unless the spouse passes away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **After Age 65**:
    *   Both DBPP and DCPP income are eligible for [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   Withdrawals from RIFs and LIFs also become eligible, simplifying the balancing of taxable income for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin
Ted receives $40,000 annually from his pension, taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Robin has very little income, taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. By [[pension_income_splitting_and_its_benefits | splitting pension income]], Ted can shift some income to Robin, reducing their overall tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

*   **Without Splitting**: Ted pays $12,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **With Splitting**: By splitting 20% of the income with Robin, it's taxed at her lower 15% rate, saving $3,000 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Strategy 3: [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | Spousal RRSP Contributions]]

This strategy involves a higher-income spouse contributing to an RRSP in the lower-income spouse's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The contributing spouse receives an immediate tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In retirement, when the lower-income spouse withdraws funds, they are taxed at their lower rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This is ideal for balancing [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement incomes]], especially if one partner has a workplace pension or there's a significant age gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin's Retirement Plan
Ted earns $120,000 annually, taxed at 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Robin earns $40,000 annually, taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The goal is to equalize their retirement savings, as Ted has a pension and Robin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Strategy**: Ted contributes $12,000 to a [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | spousal RRSP]] in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Immediate Deduction**: Ted's contribution lowers his taxable income, saving him $4,200 in taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Future Tax Efficiency**: When Robin withdraws the funds, she pays $2,400 in taxes at her lower 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Net Savings**: $1,800 in household taxes by shifting income to Robin's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The essence of this strategy is to anticipate which spouse will have a lower income in retirement and leverage [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | spousal RRSPs]] to benefit from that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Pro Tips
*   **Avoid Early Withdrawals**: If funds are withdrawn within 3 years of contribution, they will be attributed back to the contributing spouse and taxed at their higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Plan for Equal Balances**: Aim for equal RRSP balances to avoid uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Consider Age Differences**: If one spouse is significantly younger, plan contributions to ensure balanced withdrawals during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Strategy 4: Splitting CPP Income

For couples receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits, [[income_splitting_strategies_to_reduce_taxes | income splitting]] is an easy way to reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Up to 50% of CPP benefits can be shifted from the higher-income spouse to the lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This lowers the household tax bill and can help avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin's CPP Splitting Plan
Ted receives $12,000 annually in CPP benefits, taxed at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Robin receives $6,000 in CPP benefits, taxed at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. By splitting Ted's CPP income, they shift $3,000 to Robin, resulting in tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

*   **Without Splitting**: Ted pays more taxes due to his higher tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **With Splitting**: Shifting $3,000 of CPP income to Robin lowers their overall tax bill by $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Strategy 5: Splitting Capital Losses

Capital losses can be transferred to a spouse to offset their capital gains, utilizing the Superficial Loss rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. This reduces the household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### How it Works
1.  Sell shares at a loss in a non-registered account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
2.  Your spouse buys the same shares within 30 days (before or after your sale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
3.  The loss is denied to you but added to your spouse's adjusted cost basis (ACB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
4.  Your spouse must hold the shares for at least 30 days after the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Example: Ted and Robin
Ted has a $4,000 capital loss from selling investments, while Robin has $15,000 in capital gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. By transferring Ted's loss using superficial loss rules, Robin's taxable gains are reduced, saving taxes overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

*   Ted sells shares, incurring a $4,000 capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   Robin purchases the same shares within 30 days, triggering the Superficial Loss rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   Ted's loss is denied but added to Robin's cost base for the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   When Robin eventually sells those shares, the $4,000 loss effectively offsets her taxable gains, reducing their overall household tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Pro Tip
This strategy only works for non-registered accounts, requiring good record-keeping of adjusted cost bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Strategy 6: Investment Loans for Your Spouse or Child (Prescribed Rate Loan)

A prescribed rate loan can reduce a family's overall tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. A high-income spouse or family member lends money to a lower-income spouse or child at the CRA's prescribed interest rate (e.g., 5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The borrower invests the money, and any investment income is taxed at their lower rate instead of the lender's higher one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This strategy may be worth exploring for families with significant income differences and solid investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Risks
*   Potential for poor investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Possibility of increased prescribed rates in the future, reducing effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Professional guidance is highly recommended before attempting this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Strategy 7: Family Trusts

A Family Trust in Canada is a legal arrangement where a trustee holds assets for beneficiaries, typically family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It offers several tax-saving strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

### Benefits
*   **Income Splitting Potential**: Income can be distributed to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets, potentially reducing the overall family tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Multiply Capital Gains Exemptions**: Allocating capital gains to multiple beneficiaries allows each to utilize their lifetime capital gains exemption, leading to significant tax savings when selling qualified small business shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Estate Freezing**: Transferring future growth of assets to beneficiaries can minimize taxes upon death by capping the value subject to capital gains taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

Family trusts are a very complicated procedure, requiring legal and accounting professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Combining Strategies for Maximum Impact

While [[income_splitting_for_tax_savings | income splitting]] might seem complex, its true power lies in combining strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Each strategy serves a purpose, but together they can build a solid financial foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

For instance, a couple could:
1.  Contribute to an FHSA for one partner to claim a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
2.  Use [[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | pension splitting]] in [[retirement_income_splitting_strategies | retirement]] to balance income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
3.  Add [[income_splitting_with_rrsps | spousal RRSP]] contributions to create more tax-deferred savings, further reducing household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Together, these strategies can seamlessly lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial goals like saving for a home or [[planning_taxsaving_strategies | planning]] for a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Blueprint Financial offers personalized [[income_splitting_and_tax_savings_for_families_and_retirees | income splitting]] plans to save time and reduce taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

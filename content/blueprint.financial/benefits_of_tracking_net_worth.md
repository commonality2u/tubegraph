## Why Track Your Net Worth?

Tracking [[tracking_and_improving_net_worth | net worth]] is comparable to tracking weight loss; small, consistent actions lead to significant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Research from Yukon and the University of Pennsylvania demonstrated that weight loss participants who regularly tracked their diets saw notable outcomes, with those tracking 70% of the time losing 10% of their weight in six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The principle is that tracking is correlated with success, even if it's not perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

The same applies to finances: by tracking your [[the_role_of_net_worth_versus_income_in_wealth_measurement | net worth]] monthly or quarterly, you can:
*   Spot trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Make smarter decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Stay on course towards your [[setting_financial_goals_and_monitoring_progress | financial goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

It's about consistency, not perfection, focusing on broad metrics like total savings, investments, and debt without overcomplicating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Tracking your [[the_role_of_net_worth_versus_income_in_wealth_measurement | net worth]] is like steering a ship with a compass; without it, you won't know if you're drifting off course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Building a seven-figure Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) is achievable for many Canadians, even for those who aren't the highest earners or "stock-picking geniuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The secret lies in following a set of [[key_principles_of_becoming_rsp_millionaires | key principles]], particularly prioritizing contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Making Contributions "Hurt" (In a Good Way)

Successful RSP savers don't just contribute what feels comfortable; they push themselves to save more, even when it's challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:07">[00:53:07]</a>. This approach can be compared to a challenging workout â€“ the soreness is proof of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. In contrast, saving only what's left after expenses often leaves little for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

[[the_importance_of_having_a_clear_rrsp_investment_strategy | RSP millionaires]] reverse this common habit:
*   **Pay Your RSP First** They prioritize their RSP contributions before rent, bills, or any other expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>. They view RSP savings as non-optional, similar to a mortgage payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>. Warren Buffett famously advised, "Do not save what is left after spending but spend what is left after saving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:07">[03:12:07]</a>.
*   **Force Scarcity Trick** They increase RSP contributions every time they receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>. For instance, a 5% raise might prompt a 2-3% increase in RSP contributions, meaning they never grow accustomed to the extra income and don't miss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:07">[02:26:07]</a>.
*   **Round Up Savings** Instead of saving a fixed amount like $500, they might aim for $550 or $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:07">[04:47:07]</a>. This small, consistent stretch over decades significantly increases wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:07">[05:20:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Lifestyle Creep** Rather than upgrading their lifestyle with every raise (new car, bigger apartment), they prioritize upgrading their savings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:07">[02:03:07]</a>.

It's crucial to find a balance; saving too intensely can lead to stress or burnout, while not pushing enough results in stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:07">[02:16:07]</a>. The goal is to challenge oneself without becoming miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>.

### The Impact of Prioritization: Jennifer vs. John
*   **Jennifer** saves whatever is left at the end of the month, which varies wildly and is often nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>. After 30 years, she is constantly playing catch-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:07">[03:02:07]</a>.
*   **John** consistently contributes at least $600 a month and increases his contributions with every raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:07">[02:53:07]</a>. After 30 years, John retires with hundreds of thousands more due to consistency and slight pushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:07">[03:06:07]</a>.

## Effortless Saving Through Automation

[[automation_in_rsp_savings_and_investment | Automation]] is a key secret to achieving wealth by tricking your future self into being rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:07">[06:16:07]</a>. It removes the need for constant discipline and willpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:07">[06:21:07]</a>.

Methods include:
*   **Pre-Authorized Contributions** Setting up automatic transfers to your RSP on payday prevents you from spending the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:07">[06:31:07]</a>.
*   **Automatic Annual Increases** Arranging for a 1% automatic increase in contributions annually ensures savings grow effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:07">[06:38:07]</a>.
*   **Reinvesting RSP Tax Refunds** Instead of spending tax refunds on vacations or gadgets, [[maximizing_contributions_to_taxadvantaged_accounts | reinvesting them]] adds significant amounts to portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:07">[06:46:07]</a>.
*   **Leveraging "Free Money"** Taking full advantage of [[importance_of_employer_matching_for_rrsp | employer RSP matching]] is crucial, as is utilizing spousal RSPs to balance taxes in retirement and claiming deduction carry-forwards when most tax-efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:07">[07:01:07]</a>.

This automated approach, as demonstrated by Sophie, removes human error from the equation, leading to significantly greater wealth in retirement compared to manual, inconsistent saving methods like James's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:07">[07:14:07]</a>.

## Investment Approach for Prioritized Contributions

Beyond the act of prioritizing contributions, [[stoic_investing_approach_for_rsp_growth | stoic investors]] apply a disciplined mindset to how their RSPs are managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:07">[03:21:07]</a>. This means adhering to a rules-based system, ignoring market noise, and accepting volatility as a natural part of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:07">[03:50:07]</a>. They avoid emotional reactions like chasing "hot stocks" or panic selling, understanding that consistency and sticking to the plan lead to long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:07">[04:20:07]</a>.

## A Common RSP Millionaire Mistake: Lack of an Exit Strategy

Many high-net-worth RSP holders make a costly mistake by focusing solely on growing their RSP without planning how to withdraw it tax-efficiently in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:07">[07:42:07]</a>. RSPs are tax-deferred, meaning withdrawals are taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:07">[08:02:07]</a>. Without a [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | clear investment strategy]], retirees risk paying excessive taxes or leaving their heirs with a substantial tax bill upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:07">[08:08:07]</a>.

Solutions for a [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | tax-efficient withdrawal strategy]] include:
*   Starting early withdrawals to spread taxable income and avoid tax spikes after age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:07">[08:23:07]</a>.
*   [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | Shifting funds into a TFSA]] to allow investments to grow tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:07">[08:31:07]</a>.
*   Coordinating RSP withdrawals with other income sources like CPP and OAS to avoid higher tax brackets and OAS clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:07">[08:35:07]</a>.
*   Considering life insurance policies for estate planning to offset the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:07">[08:44:07]</a>.

Proper [[rrsp_withdrawal_planning_in_retirement | withdrawal planning]] can save tens of thousands of dollars in taxes, ensuring more wealth remains with the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:07">[08:51:07]</a>.

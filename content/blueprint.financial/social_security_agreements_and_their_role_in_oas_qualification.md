Canada has established international [[social_security_agreements_and_their_role_in_oas_qualification | social security agreements]] with approximately 50 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. These include nations like the US, UK, Australia, several Asian countries, and many EU nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, as well as India and the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Purpose of Agreements

The primary role of these [[social_security_agreements_and_their_role_in_oas_qualification | social security agreements]] is to assist individuals in qualifying for [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | Old Age Security (OAS)]] benefits, even if they have not spent the full required time living in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

These agreements allow Canada to count a person's time spent in specific other countries towards their 10-year or 20-year residency minimums for [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | OAS]] eligibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, if an individual lived in Canada for 7 years and the UK for 13 years, they might still qualify for [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | OAS]] under the Canada-UK agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Limitations

It is important to note that while these agreements can help meet the minimum residency requirements, they **do not** count towards the full 40 years of residency needed to qualify for 100% [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | OAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Consequently, individuals benefiting from these agreements are likely to receive only partial [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | OAS]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Immigrants

For immigrants, where they have lived and where they plan to retire significantly impacts their [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | OAS]] payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If an immigrant plans to retire abroad, it is crucial to check if Canada has a [[social_security_agreements_and_their_role_in_oas_qualification | social security agreement]] with that specific country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Not all countries are on the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

If an individual is close to the 20-year [[oas_eligibility_and_tax_considerations_for_nonresidents | OAS]] threshold for portability and intends to retire in a country without an agreement, it might be beneficial to delay their move for a couple of years to meet the residency requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This strategic delay could result in hundreds of thousands of dollars in extra benefits over their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

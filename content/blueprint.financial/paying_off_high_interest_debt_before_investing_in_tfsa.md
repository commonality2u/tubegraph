One significant mistake individuals make is [[investing_vs_saving_in_a_tfsa|investing in a TFSA]] before paying off high-interest debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While starting TFSA investments early might seem like a smart financial move, it's often more beneficial to tackle high-interest debt first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## The Cost of High-Interest Debt

Credit card interest rates can be exceptionally high, often reaching 20% or more annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. It is incredibly difficult for any investment to consistently earn returns that high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Such high returns are typically reserved for elite investors; for example, Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, has delivered an average annual return of about 20% since 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The Benefit of Debt Repayment

By focusing on paying off high-interest debt, you are effectively earning a 20% return on your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This strategy not only saves you a substantial amount in interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> but also places you in a stronger financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Once this debt is cleared, you gain more freedom to invest without the burden of high-interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Instead of trying to out-earn your debt with investments, it's recommended to:
*   Assess your current debt situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   Consider redirecting funds towards paying it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Once you are debt-free, you will be able to invest more effectively and see your TFSA grow without concerns about interest charges draining your hard-earned money and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

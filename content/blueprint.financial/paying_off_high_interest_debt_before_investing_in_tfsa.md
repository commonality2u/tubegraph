One significant mistake individuals make with their Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is prioritizing investments before clearing high-interest debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:04">[05:30:04]</a>. While starting TFSA investments early might seem like a smart move, especially for younger clients eager to grow their wealth, carrying high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, makes it financially prudent to address that first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:38">[05:37:38]</a>.

## The Cost of High-Interest Debt

Credit card interest rates can often be 20% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:08">[05:48:08]</a>. It is extremely difficult for any investment to consistently achieve returns that high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:24">[05:51:24]</a>. Returns of this magnitude are typically reserved for elite investors; for instance, Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, has delivered an average annual return of around 20% since 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:02">[05:59:02]</a>.

## Why Debt Repayment is the Better "Investment"

By focusing on paying off high-interest debt, you are effectively "earning" a 20% return on your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:52">[06:08:52]</a>. This strategy offers a guaranteed return that is difficult to match with typical investments.

## Benefits of Debt Freedom

Not only does eliminating high-interest debt save you a significant amount on interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:04">[06:14:04]</a>, but it also places you in a much stronger financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:32">[06:16:32]</a>. Once the debt is cleared, you gain more freedom to invest without the burden of ongoing high-interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:41">[06:20:41]</a>.

## Actionable Steps

Assess your debt situation and consider redirecting funds towards paying it off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:01">[06:26:01]</a>. Once you are debt-free, you will be able to invest more effectively and watch your TFSA grow without interest draining your hard-earned money and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:59">[06:31:59]</a>.

Deciding when to begin receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is one of the most significant retirement choices an individual can make <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Despite the fact that over 95% of Canadians begin their CPP benefits at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 often proves optimal for many, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This decision is akin to a retirement jigsaw puzzle, where factors such as [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancy]], investment returns, and income streams must be carefully aligned to maximize benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The 2020 Actuarial CPP Take-Up Decision Report

A detailed 2020 Actuarial study provides significant insights into the optimal timing for starting CPP benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This report delves into probabilities, [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancies]], and expected investment returns to guide the decision-making process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The report offers a "cheat sheet" summarizing key considerations based on different CPP start ages:

### Starting CPP at Age 60

*   **Best for Immediate Income/Health Concerns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>: This option is ideal for individuals who need immediate income or have health issues that suggest a shorter [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Permanent Drawbacks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>: Starting at 60 results in a 36% lifetime reduction in payments compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This significantly impacts long-term income, especially for those living beyond age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **High Investment Returns** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>: If an individual's investment funds can achieve 6% or more in annual returns, taking CPP at 60 allows for investment of the payments, potentially yielding a higher overall financial outcome, though with increased risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **GIS and OAS Considerations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>: Claiming CPP at 60 can help low-income retirees avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks, smoothing income throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. For example, John, a 60-year-old with health issues and minimal savings, might choose this to secure income and prevent GIS benefit clawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 65

*   **Default Option** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>: This age is a common choice that balances steady payments and avoids the need for savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Ideal Candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>: It suits retirees with below-average to average [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancy]] and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>: Standard CPP benefits provide reliable [[inflation_considerations_regarding_cpp | inflation]]-adjusted income without requiring additional complex planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Trade-offs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>: This option leaves potential income on the table for those who live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Analysis** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>: Payments from starting at 65 equalize with the age 70 option around age 80, making it a reasonable middle ground for those uncertain about [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | longevity]] or [[investment_performance_of_cpp | returns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Maria, for instance, might choose 65 if she retires with modest savings and average health to maintain predictable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to Age 70

*   **Highest Guaranteed Lifetime Income** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>: Delaying CPP provides the maximum increase in payments, which are also [[inflation_considerations_regarding_cpp | inflation]]-adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Ideal Candidates** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>: This option is best for those with longer [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to cover the income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Longevity Protection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>: Payments continue for life, providing secure income into advanced ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **High Effective Return** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>: Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to approximately 6% to 8% annually, making it a strong choice compared to many other [[investment_performance_of_cpp | investment options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Break-Even Age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>: For most, delaying CPP becomes financially advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Susan, for instance, might delay CPP if she expects to live into her late 80s or 90s and has adequate RSP funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Life Expectancy Insights from the 2020 CPP Report

The 2020 CPP take-up decision report also highlights the odds of living past age 80, based on gender and [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | longevity]] expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Key takeaways regarding [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancy]] from the report:
*   **Gender Differences** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>: Women generally live longer than men, with 82% of women likely to live past age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This makes delaying CPP especially beneficial for women seeking secure, [[inflation_considerations_regarding_cpp | inflation]]-protected income in later years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Healthy Lifestyle and Family History** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>: Individuals with a healthy lifestyle or a family history of longevity have increased odds of living longer (79% for men, 85% for women), reinforcing that delayed CPP can be a smarter choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Majority Benefit from Delaying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>: Even with low [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | longevity expectations]], the majority of Canadians are expected to live past age 80, suggesting that most retirees would benefit from waiting to maximize lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Actuarial studies and reports on CPP emphasize that deciding when to start benefits is a complex puzzle influenced by personal [[life_expectancy_and_longevity_planning_for_cpp | life expectancy]], investment returns, and tax considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. While most Canadians claim CPP early, these reports highlight the significant financial advantages of delaying benefits for many, often leading to tens of thousands of dollars more in lifetime retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

In Canada, with high home prices, utilizing every available financial tool for saving counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Combining the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) can make saving a significant down payment, such as $200,000, well within reach and tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This strategy can maximize savings and help achieve the dream of homeownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## First Home Savings Account (FHSA)

The FHSA is a new tool for first-time homebuyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Contribution Limits and Tax Deductibility
*   Individuals can contribute up to $8,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   There is a lifetime maximum contribution limit of $40,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
*   Contributions are tax-deductible, similar to an RRSP, providing an annual tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Spousal Contributions
*   When buying a home with a spouse or common-law partner, the combined FHSA savings can double to $80,000, offering a significant tax-free boost to a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   If a higher-income spouse contributes to your FHSA, the contribution is treated as if you made it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This means the tax benefits, such as deductions and tax-free growth, apply to the FHSA holder, not the contributor, and the contributor has no tax obligation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Tax-Free Withdrawals
*   A key benefit of the FHSA is that qualified withdrawals for a home purchase are entirely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This ensures every dollar saved goes directly towards the future home without repayment obligations, unlike the RRSP's Home Buyers' Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) and Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)

The RRSP is a well-established account for retirement savings in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Contribution Limits and Tax Deductibility
*   Individuals can contribute up to 18% of their income annually, with a maximum of $31,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Home Buyers' Plan (HBP)
*   The HBP allows individuals to withdraw up to $60,000 tax-free from their RRSP to put towards a first home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   For couples buying a home, this amount doubles to $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Unlike the FHSA, the HBP requires the withdrawn funds to be repaid over 15 years, starting five years after the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Missing a repayment means that amount is added to the taxable income for that year, increasing the tax burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## [[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_to_save_for_a_home | Combining FHSA and RRSP for Home Ownership]]

[[combining_fhsa_and_rrsp_to_save_for_a_home | Combining FHSA and RRSP]] effectively for a down payment can significantly accelerate the path to home ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Example: Ross and Rachel
Ross and Rachel's story illustrates the power of combining these accounts:
*   They each maxed out their FHSAs, contributing $40,000 each for a total of $80,000 in tax-free savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   They also utilized the HBP, withdrawing $60,000 each from their RRSPs for a combined $120,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   By combining the FHSA and HBP, they amassed $200,000 for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This not only helped them secure their dream home but also maximized their tax benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   For an individual saver, this strategy can still accumulate up to $100,000 for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### [[investment_potential_of_fhsa_and_rrsp | Investment Potential of the FHSA]]
The FHSA has significant growth potential over time:
*   Contributing the maximum $8,000 per year for five years reaches the $40,000 lifetime limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   Assuming a 6% annual return, this $40,000 would grow to approximately $45,000 in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   If left untouched for another 10 years at the same 6% rate, the $45,000 could grow to around $80,000, effectively doubling the original contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This growth is entirely tax-free if used for a home purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Combined Growth Example: Ross and Rachel Revisited
*   If Ross and Rachel both contribute the maximum to their FHSAs for five years, saving $80,000 combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   With a 6% return over the next 10 years, their combined FHSA balance could grow to over $160,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Adding $120,000 from their HBP withdrawals ($60,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, they would have a total of $280,000 available for their down payment, all tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This strategy provides a significant advantage in the housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | Maximizing Tax Benefits for Down Payments]]

The [[tax_advantages_of_fhsa_versus_rrsp | tax advantages]] of accounts like the FHSA and RRSP make a massive difference in the actual amount needed to save for a down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Without these tax benefits:
*   To save $200,000 for a down payment without tax-free accounts, income taxes must be factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   For example, with a 30% tax rate, one would need to earn over $285,000 to have $200,000 remaining after taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This means an additional $85,000 would need to be saved to reach the goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Using FHSA and RRSP:
*   Contributions to these accounts are tax-deductible, meaning income contributed is not taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   This allows savers to accumulate the full $200,000 without paying taxes on the income used for contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   By leveraging these accounts, the exact target amount of $200,000 is all that needs to be saved, as every dollar contributed directly serves the home purchase, drastically reducing the overall savings required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Canadian Housing Market Context
> The Canadian housing market presents a significant challenge for first-time homebuyers due to skyrocketing prices, especially in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. A $200,000 down payment can cover about 32% of the total cost in more affordable cities like Montreal and Calgary but only 16-19% in higher-priced markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This highlights the critical importance of using tax-free savings tools like the FHSA and HBP to offset larger mortgage burdens or facilitate market entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

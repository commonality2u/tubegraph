When relocating from Canada, it is crucial to understand how tax treaties affect your tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected and negative tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## What are Tax Treaties?

Tax treaties are agreements between countries that help prevent double taxation and clarify tax residency rules for individuals who might otherwise be considered residents of both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

An individual can be considered a "deemed non-resident" if they qualify as a tax resident in another country that has a tax treaty with Canada, meaning Canada will not tax them as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The primary difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident lies in how tax residency is determined and whether a tax treaty applies, though both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Resolving Dual Residency with Tie-Breaker Rules

If your new country has a tax treaty with Canada, specific "tie-breaker rules" are typically used to resolve situations where both countries could claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. These rules assess several criteria:

*   **Permanent Home** Where do you have a permanent place of residence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
*   **Center of Vital Interests** Where are your personal and economic ties strongest? This includes factors like family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Habitual Abode** In which country do you habitually reside? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>
*   **Physical Presence** This often relates to the 183-day rule, where some countries automatically consider you a tax resident if you spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Canada-US Tax Treaty Example

The US employs a "substantial presence test" to determine tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. An individual qualifies if they are physically present in the US for at least 31 days during the current year, and a total of 183 days over the current and preceding two years, using a specific calculation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

However, even if you meet the substantial presence test in the US, the Canada-US tax treaty tie-breaker rules can resolve dual residency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. For instance, if your permanent residence and center of vital interests remain in Canada, you may still be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Case Study: Tiffany's Job Assignment in New York

Tiffany, a Canadian citizen, takes a one-year job in New York. She owns a condo in Toronto where her spouse and children reside, and she maintains Canadian bank accounts and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She spends more than 183 days in the US, qualifying her as a US tax resident under their substantial presence test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Despite meeting the US test, the Canada-US tax treaty's tie-breaker rules apply:

*   **Permanent Home:** Tiffany owns a home in Canada, although she rents an apartment in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Center of Vital Interests:** Her family and financial ties remain in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Habitual Abode:** She intends to return to Canada after one year, indicating her long-term residency remains Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Citizenship:** If uncertainty persists, her Canadian citizenship favors Canada as her tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

As a result, Canada remains Tiffany's primary tax residency under the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The US may still tax her US-sourced income, but she can avoid being fully taxed as a US resident on her worldwide income, such as investments or rental properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## Impact on Withholding Taxes

Tax treaty considerations also influence withholding tax rates for Canadian-sourced income received by non-residents. Rates for pensions (CPP and OAS), rental income from Canadian property, and RSP withdrawals are generally subject to a 25% withholding tax for non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. However, tax treaties between Canada and other countries can reduce this rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

Withholding tax rates vary by country under Canada's tax treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Some countries qualify for reduced rates on pensions, dividends, and rental income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. For example, if you move to the US, you will likely have lower CPP, OAS, and RSP withholding tax rates than the standard 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Before filing forms like NR5 (to reduce withholding taxes on certain income) or electing under Section 216 (to pay tax on net rental income), it is advisable to [[managing_canadian_income_tax_obligations_after_leaving_canada | check if your new country has a tax treaty with Canada that automatically lowers your withholding tax]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

The Old Age Security (OAS) benefit is a government payment that can provide valuable income in retirement, potentially reaching up to $948 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, this entire amount can be clawed back by the government if your income exceeds certain thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Understanding the OAS Clawback (Recovery Tax)

The OAS clawback, also known as the recovery tax, begins when your income surpasses the threshold of $90,995 for the 2024 income year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The clawback applies a 15% recovery tax on the amount of income over this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

For instance, David, a 75-year-old in 2024, has an income of $160,000, which is well above the clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 15% recovery tax on his income over $90,995 amounts to $10,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Since his annual OAS benefit ($948) is less than this amount, he will lose all his OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Understanding the [[oas_clawback_explanation | OAS clawback explanation]] is crucial for retirement planning.

## Strategies to Reduce or Avoid the OAS Clawback

There are several effective [[avoiding_oas_clawbacks | strategies for minimizing pension clawbacks]] and protecting your OAS benefits. These range from simpler adjustments to more complex financial planning.

### 1. Delay Your CPP Payments

[[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | Delaying your CPP payments]] until a later age, such as 68, 69, or 70, is one of the most effective [[strategies_for_maximizing_cpp_and_oas_benefits | strategies for maximizing CPP and OAS benefits]] and reducing OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Increases your CPP payments by up to 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Lowers your taxable income between the ages of 65 and 70, when the OAS clawback typically applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Higher CPP payments are indexed to inflation, growing in value over your lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

For example, delaying a $1,000 monthly CPP payment from age 65 to 70 would increase it to $1,420 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Peter Parker, who faced an $811 OAS clawback at age 65 due to high taxable income from CPP and other sources, reduced his clawback to $584 by delaying CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This saved him over $2,000 on the OAS clawback and secured higher CPP payments for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. [[strategies_to_maximize_cpp_benefits | Strategies to maximize CPP benefits]] often involve considering deferral.

### 2. Delay Your OAS Payments

Similar to CPP, [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying your OAS payments]] up to age 70 can significantly help in [[timing_cpp_and_oas_for_tax_efficiency | timing CPP and OAS for tax efficiency]] and avoiding the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Increases your monthly OAS payments by 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   Reduces or eliminates the clawback during earlier retirement years when income might be higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

For instance, delaying a $500 monthly OAS payment from age 65 to 70 would increase it to $680 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. By delaying OAS until age 70, Peter Parker entirely eliminated his $811 OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This is particularly beneficial if you anticipate higher income between ages 65 and 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Health and Life Expectancy
> It is important to note that delaying CPP and OAS may not be the most beneficial option if you have health issues or a shorter life expectancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Personalized planning is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### 3. Use Your TFSA Wisely

A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) is an excellent tool to help avoid the OAS clawback because withdrawals are completely tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Funds can be accessed for living expenses without increasing your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   Helps you stay below the OAS clawback threshold of $90,995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

For example, withdrawing $20,000 annually from a $100,000 TFSA for living expenses would not incur any taxes or count as taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. If this $20,000 were withdrawn from a taxable account like an RRSP, it could push your income over the threshold, triggering the clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

> [!TIP] RRSP to TFSA Ladder
> Consider gradually withdrawing from your RRSP and contributing to your TFSA before age 71. This keeps your taxable income lower later on and allows tax-free withdrawals from your TFSA in retirement, minimizing the OAS clawback effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### 4. Pension Income Splitting

Pension income splitting is a valuable strategy for [[strategies_for_minimizing_pension_clawbacks | strategies for minimizing pension clawbacks]] and reducing taxable income, especially when one spouse earns significantly less than the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **How it works:** You can transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your lower-income spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Reduces the higher-earning spouse's taxable income, potentially putting them in a lower tax bracket and reducing the risk of triggering the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   As a couple, you pay less overall tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

If Peter earns $60,000 annually from his pension and his wife Mary Jane earns much less, Peter can transfer $30,000 of his pension income to Mary Jane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This reduces Peter's taxable income from $60,000 to $30,000, helping him stay below the OAS clawback threshold of $90,997 and preserving his full OAS benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### 5. Manage Your RRIF Withdrawals

When you turn 71, your RRSP converts into a RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund), and you must begin making minimum annual withdrawals, which are considered taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These withdrawals can push your income over the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Use your younger spouse's age to reduce the required RRIF withdrawal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

For Peter (age 71) and Mary Jane (age 65), basing Peter's RRIF withdrawals on Mary Jane's younger age reduces the withdrawal rate from 5.28% to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. For a $200,000 RRIF, this means withdrawing $8,000 instead of $10,560, lowering their taxable income by $2,560 and helping them stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### 6. Invest Strategically in Non-Registered Accounts

The type of income generated from non-registered accounts can significantly impact your taxable income and potentially trigger the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Income Types and Taxation:**
    *   **Interest income** (from bonds, GICs, savings accounts) is fully taxable at your marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
    *   **Dividend income** is taxed at a lower rate but still adds to taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
    *   **Capital gains** (from selling assets like stocks for profit) are only taxed at 50% of your marginal tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Focus on growth investments, such as growth stocks, that primarily generate capital gains rather than interest or dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This can reduce your taxable income and help you stay below the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

If your portfolio generates $10,000 in interest income, the full amount is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, if you shift to growth investments that generate $10,000 in capital gains, only $5,000 would be taxable, reducing your countable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Being mindful of what counts towards your income when [[investing_strategies_to_avoid_cra_fines | investing strategies to avoid CRA fines]] can help you avoid passing the OAS clawback threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### 7. Capture Capital Gains Before Age 65

Timing is crucial for managing capital gains to avoid the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Strategy:** Realize capital gains before you turn 65, ideally between ages 60 and 64 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Avoids large taxable events once OAS payments begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   Allows you to pay taxes earlier and avoid increasing your taxable income during your retirement years when OAS starts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

If you plan to sell a property or investments for a $50,000 gain, doing so at age 63 or 64 ensures this gain won't count towards your taxable income during the crucial years when OAS begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This can help you stay under the clawback threshold and save thousands in reduced benefits and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Comprehensive Retirement Planning

Effective retirement planning involves understanding how strategies like [[delaying_cpp_and_oas_payments | delaying CPP and OAS payments]], wisely using your TFSA, and managing RRIF withdrawals can help you avoid the OAS clawback and retain more of your benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. These smart financial moves can potentially save you tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For complex cases involving retirement properties or businesses, personalized planning is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

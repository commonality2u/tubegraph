## Public Concerns and Realities
There has been public mistrust regarding the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), with some people believing it will run out of money or that payments will not be received if delayed, or that it is an unfair system [00:04:51]. While it is possible for pensions to be underfunded, as seen with General Motors in 2008 during the financial crisis, where the U.S. government had to intervene and some retirees did not receive full pensions, this scenario is highly unlikely for the CPP [00:05:11]. The CPP is considered to be at very low risk of being underfunded [00:06:24].

## Contribution Growth
[[cpp_2025_enhancements_and_contribution_updates | CPP contribution rates]] are projected to grow significantly [00:05:37]. Base CPP contributions are expected to increase from $61 billion in 2022 to $177 billion in 2050 [00:05:40]. Similarly, contributions for the additional CPP are projected to rise from $9.3 billion to $45 billion over the same period [00:05:51]. This indicates a substantial cash flow into the CPP [00:05:57].

## Independent Reviews and Sustainability
The CPP undergoes regular independent peer reviews to ensure the actuarial methods and assumptions are sound [00:06:02]. The latest report determined that the CPP possesses sufficient funds to be [[current_and_future_financial_health_of_the_CPP | financially sustainable]] for at least the next 75 years [00:06:11]. This projection extends well beyond the lifetimes of current contributors and potentially their children [00:06:19].

## Investment Performance
The CPP has shown solid investment returns over the long term [00:06:28]. According to its 2023 annual report, the CPP's investment portfolio achieved a 10-year annualized net real return of 7.4% [00:06:33].

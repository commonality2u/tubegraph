Currency conversion fees, also known as FX fees, are a hidden cost that can significantly impact investment returns, especially for Canadians investing in U.S. stocks or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Most brokerage firms charge an FX fee of between 1.5% to 2.5% per transaction every time Canadian dollars (CAD) are converted to U.S. dollars (USD) or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These charges can quickly accumulate and eat into investment profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Impact of FX Fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>

Consider an example where an investor converts $50,000 CAD into USD to invest in U.S. stock:
*   A 2% FX fee would immediately result in a $1,000 loss, leaving only $49,000 available for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   Upon selling the investment and converting the proceeds back to CAD, another 2% FX fee would be applied, taking an additional $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   This means a total of $2,000 could be lost solely to currency conversion fees, even before accounting for other trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

For individuals who frequently trade U.S. stocks or rebalance their portfolios, these hidden fees can amount to tens of thousands of dollars over a lifetime, money that could otherwise have been compounding in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid or Minimize FX Fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>

Several strategies can help reduce the impact of currency conversion fees:
*   **Use Discount Brokerages with Lower FX Fees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>: Some brokers, such as Interactive Brokers, offer significantly lower FX fees in Canada, although their platforms may not be the most user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Employ Norbert's Gambit** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>: This tactic involves buying an interlisted stock (a stock traded on both Canadian and U.S. exchanges), journaling it to the other currency, and then selling it, effectively avoiding most FX fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This method is more complex but can be very effective.
*   **Maintain a U.S. Dollar Brokerage Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>: By keeping a U.S. dollar account, investors can trade U.S. stocks without needing to convert CAD to USD for each transaction, thus avoiding repeated conversion fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

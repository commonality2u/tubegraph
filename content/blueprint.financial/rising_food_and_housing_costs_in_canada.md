Canada is currently experiencing a serious [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Approximately 50% of Canadians are living paycheck to paycheck, according to Equifax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Social media is filled with accounts of individuals struggling to make ends meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A recent poll by Angus Reid indicates that a shocking 40% of recent immigrants are considering moving to another province or leaving Canada entirely, primarily due to the high cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Rising Cost of Everyday Items

Canadians are facing significant frustration due to the increasing cost of necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Grocery Bills
Food prices have seen a dramatic increase. David Olive noted in a Toronto Star article that a basket of 18 household items, which cost $82 in March 2021, now costs $113.32 today (July 2024), representing a 38.2% increase in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The latest Canada Food Price Report predicts an increase of about $711 in the average family of four's annual food bill for this year, bringing the total average to $16,295 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This follows a $1,065 jump in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Food prices have significantly outpaced the average rate of [[impact_of_inflation_on_food_prices_in_canada | inflation]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Rental and Housing Costs
Shelter costs are another major concern.
*   **Rent**: In April 2021, the average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Vancouver was $2,598 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. By July 2024, this average had risen to $3,648 per month, a 40% increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Home Ownership**: The average cost to buy a house in Canada was $413,000 in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. By May 2024, this average had skyrocketed to $699,000, marking a staggering 69.3% increase over nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Both food and housing, two essential categories, have become significantly more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Other costs like transportation and entertainment have also increased generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Income Growth Versus Cost of Living

Unfortunately, [[income_growth_versus_cost_of_living_in_canada | income growth]] has not kept pace with the rising [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. According to Stat Canada's latest data, the median after-tax income for Canadian families and unattached individuals was $70,500 in 2022, a decrease from $73,000 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Average wages are unlikely to have increased sufficiently in 2023 or 2024 to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The combination of soaring grocery, household goods, rent, and housing costs, coupled with inadequate income growth, makes it difficult for many Canadians to get by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Further financial strain has been caused by the discontinuation of pandemic-related government benefits and the return to pre-pandemic Employment Insurance programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Widespread Unhappiness and Migration Trends

The challenges are impacting well-being. The latest World Happiness Report by the Gallup World Poll ranks Canada as the 15th happiest country overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, Canadians under the age of 30 fall to 58th place, highlighting a significant disparity in happiness levels among younger Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Many Canadians are considering moving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Approximately 28% of all Canadians are thinking about leaving their province due to high housing costs, with young adults and renters being the most likely to consider such a move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This trend is particularly evident in Ontario and British Columbia, where high housing costs have persisted longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Popular relocation spots include Alberta, where 18% of Canadians considering a move are looking due to more affordable housing and better job opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A recent report shows that net interprovincial migration out of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver was over 130,000 people between 2022 and 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. These trends underscore the significant [[overview_of_canadas_real_estate_market_challenges | challenges in Canada's real estate market]] and their impact on interprovincial migration and the [[comparison_of_home_affordability_in_canadian_cities | comparison of home affordability in Canadian cities]].

## Actionable Tips to Combat the High Cost of Living

While many issues stem from uncontrollable economic factors, individuals can manage what they control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The two main approaches are to earn more money or to spend less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Earning More Money
Strategies to boost earnings vary by income level:

*   **Lower Income Canadians**:
    *   **Start a Side Hustle**: Consider a part-time job or freelancing, such as freelance writing on platforms like Upwork, driving for Uber, delivering for DoorDash, or starting an online store on Etsy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   **Skill Development**: Invest in learning new, in-demand skills through free or low-cost online courses on platforms like Coursera, LinkedIn Learning, or Udemy, or participate in government-subsidized training programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   **Job Search**: Constantly search for better-paying job opportunities on job boards like Indeed or Glassdoor, set automatic alerts, network on LinkedIn, attend job fairs, or join professional groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

*   **Middle Income Earners**:
    *   **Career Advancement**: Seek promotions, ask for more responsibilities, and negotiate for higher pay within your current company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   **Additional Qualifications**: Obtain certificates or post-graduate degrees that lead to higher-paying roles, ideally with employer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
    *   **Passive Income**: Explore opportunities like investments, rental properties, or creating digital products if you have savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

*   **Higher Income Earners**:
    *   **Investments**: Make money work by investing in stocks, real estate, or other higher-return opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Business Ventures**: Consider starting or investing in businesses with high profitability potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   **Consulting**: Leverage expertise to offer consulting services in your field, which can command higher fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Spending Less Money
Reducing expenses can significantly improve financial situations regardless of income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>:

*   **Lower Income Earners**:
    *   **Government Programs**: Utilize [[rising_food_insecurity_and_reliance_on_food_banks_in_canada | government assistance programs]] and services like food banks, emergency shelters, financial counseling, job training, and utility bill assistance (e.g., Salvation Army, YMCA, United Way) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   **Strict Budget**: Create and stick to a strict budget, tracking expenses to identify areas for cutbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
    *   **Reduce Big Three Expenses**: Focus on reducing food, shelter, and transportation costs, as these are typically the largest household expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **Negotiate Bills**: Negotiate bills for services like cable, internet, and phone to secure lower rates or better deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

*   **Middle Income Earners**:
    *   **Debt Management**: Focus on paying off high-interest debt to reduce monthly expenses and save money long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
    *   **Smart Shopping**: Use coupons, discounts, and cashback offers to save on everyday purchases, reflecting [[consumer_reactions_and_adaptations_to_rising_grocery_costs | consumer reactions and adaptations to rising grocery costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
    *   **Lifestyle Choices**: Evaluate lifestyle choices and identify areas to cut back, such as dining out less or choosing more affordable entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

*   **Higher Income Earners**:
    *   **Tax Planning**: Work with a financial advisor or accountant to implement tax-saving strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
    *   **Luxury Spending**: Be mindful of luxury spending and ensure it aligns with long-term financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   **Automated Savings**: Set up automatic transfers to savings and investment accounts to ensure consistent contributions and reduce the temptation to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Out-of-the-Box Solutions
Two less common but potentially impactful solutions include:

*   **Tiny Houses**: A rising trend in Canada, these compact homes (200-400 sq ft) offer savings on housing costs and promote a minimalist, environmentally friendly lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Examples include Mint Tiny House Company in Vancouver and Minimalist Houses in Quebec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Digital Nomads**: With the rise of remote work, individuals can live and work from anywhere, reducing living expenses by temporarily moving to more affordable locations abroad like Thailand, Portugal, or Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This requires only a reliable internet connection and careful planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Despite the current challenges, Canadian core values and the economy are still seen as worth preserving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. There is hope that the government will implement effective strategies to control the cost of living, and initial signs suggest inflation may be cooling off slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

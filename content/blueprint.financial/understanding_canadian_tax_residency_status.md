When considering moving abroad from Canada, it is crucial to understand your tax residency status, as Canada taxes individuals based on their residency [00:00:41]. If you do not clearly establish your residency status when leaving, you could still be considered a Canadian tax resident and owe taxes on your worldwide income [00:00:43]. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) views tax residency like an "umbilical cord"; if not cut properly, Canada will still consider you attached and continue feeding you tax obligations [00:00:51].

## Types of Tax Residency Status

There are four main types of tax residency status when considering moving countries:
*   **Factual Resident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> – An individual who lives in Canada and maintains significant residential ties to the country, even if they are temporarily living abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Emigrant** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> – An individual who leaves Canada permanently and severs significant residential ties with the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The CRA considers an individual an emigrant for tax purposes if they leave Canada and establish residency in another country, typically for a full tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Non-resident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> – An individual who stays in Canada for less than 183 days in a tax year and does not have significant ties to Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Non-residents do not pay Canadian taxes on foreign income but can be taxed on Canadian-sourced income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Deemed Non-resident** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> – Occurs when an individual qualifies as a tax resident in another country with a [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]], meaning Canada won't tax them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The key difference between a non-resident and a deemed non-resident is how [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax residency]] is determined and whether a [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]] applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, both are taxed the same way in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Special Considerations for Snowbirds
If you spend too much time in the US (more than 183 days in a calendar year), you could be classified as a US tax resident and be subject to US taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Keeping track of your days is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Tools like the "Day Count" or "Tax Bird" apps can help track your time in the US to avoid crossing the 183-day limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Maintaining Significant Ties to Canada

The CRA assesses your residential ties to determine if you remain a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. If these ties are not properly severed, you may still be taxed on your worldwide income after leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Primary Residential Ties
These are the strongest indicators of residency:
*   **Home in Canada** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a> – Owning or leasing a residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **Spouse or Partner in Canada** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> – If they remain, you may still be considered a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Dependents in Canada** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> – Such as children or other dependents living there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
Maintaining any of these ties strongly suggests you are still a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### Secondary Residential Ties
These may also influence residency status:
*   **Personal Property** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> – Cars, furniture, or recreational equipment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Social Ties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> – Memberships in Canadian clubs, religious groups, or associations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Economic Ties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a> – Active bank accounts, credit cards, investments, or employment in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Canadian Documentation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> – Holding a Canadian driver's license, passport, or health card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Mailing Address** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> – Keeping a Canadian address or PO box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
While no single secondary tie determines residency, multiple ties can keep you classified as a Canadian tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### How to Sever Residential Ties
To confirm non-residency, consider these actions:
*   **Selling or Renting Out Your Canadian Home** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a> – Leasing it to unrelated parties demonstrates you have left Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Moving Your Family Abroad** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> – Bringing your spouse and dependents reinforces non-residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Closing or Converting Canadian Financial Accounts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> – Terminate accounts or switch to non-resident banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Updating Government Records** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> – Change your address, cancel health coverage, and surrender your driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Filing Form NR73
Many individuals mistakenly believe that filing Form NR73 (Residency Determination Form) will help confirm their non-resident status with the CRA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, this form can actually work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. When you submit NR73, a CRA official will review your case and may determine that you are still a Canadian tax resident, even if you believe you have cut ties completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This could result in continued taxation on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Instead of filing Form NR73:
*   **Skip Form NR73** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> – It is not mandatory and could trigger an unfavorable ruling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **File a departure tax return** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> – Report your departure date and pay any applicable exit tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Let your actions prove non-residency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> – Sever significant ties to Canada such as selling or renting out your home, closing Canadian bank accounts, cancelling provincial health insurance, and establishing tax residency in another country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

## Tax Treaties and Tiebreaker Rules

When relocating from Canada, it's crucial to understand how [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] affect your tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Some countries have [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax treaties]] with Canada that include tiebreaker rules to determine residency when both countries can claim you as a resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Overlooking these rules can lead to unexpected and negative tax obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### How Tax Treaties Determine Residency
If your new country has a [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]] with Canada, the following criteria are typically used to resolve dual residency:
1.  **Permanent Home** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a> – Where do you have a permanent place of residence? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> If you have a permanent home in both countries, the next criterion is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
2.  **Center of Vital Interests** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a> – Where are your personal and economic ties strongest? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> This includes factors like family location, employment, and social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
3.  **Habitual Abode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> – In which country do you habitually reside? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>
4.  **Physical Presence (183-Day Rule)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> – Some countries automatically consider you tax present if you spend more than 183 days there in a tax year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
5.  **Citizenship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a> – If uncertainty remains, your Canadian citizenship may favor Canada as your tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

For example, moving to the US: The US employs a substantial presence test to determine tax residency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If you spend 183 days or more in the US during a calendar year, you could be considered a US tax resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, under the Canada-US [[the_role_of_tax_treaties_in_dual_residency_situations | tax treaty]], tiebreaker rules can resolve dual residency situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If your permanent residence and center of vital interests are still in Canada, you may be deemed a Canadian resident for tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Establishing Residency in a New Country

Properly securing legal residency in another country is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Failing to do so can lead the CRA to still consider you a Canadian tax resident, even if you leave the country without official tax residency status elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, potentially leaving you liable for Canadian taxes on your worldwide income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Steps to properly establish residency elsewhere:
*   **Obtain a Visa or Permanent Residency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a> – Ensure you have legal status in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Set up Financial Ties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a> – Open a bank account, rent or buy a house, obtain an ID card, and register for health insurance in your new country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **File Taxes in Your New Country** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a> – Paying taxes abroad helps establish you as a non-resident for Canadian tax purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

[[tax_implications_and_strategies_for_canadians_moving_abroad | Leaving Canada]] doesn't mean leaving taxes behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Without proper planning, you could end up paying thousands more than necessary or even face double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Tax law is complex in one country, and exponentially harder when two tax systems are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

A growing number of Canadians are considering leaving their home country due to various challenges, including high taxes, inflation, and harsh winters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This trend is significant, with the number of Canadians moving to the U.S. alone reaching 126,340 in 2022, a 70% increase from 75,752 in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. In 2016, an estimated 4 million Canadian citizens were living abroad, a number that has likely increased since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Key Motivations for Departure

Canadians are driven to seek lives elsewhere for several primary reasons:

### [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | Rising Cost of Living]]
The main reason people are considering leaving Canada is the [[cost_of_living_crisis_in_canada | rising cost of living]], particularly in major cities like Toronto and Vancouver, where housing prices have significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Moving to [[countries_where_canadians_can_live_affordably | countries like Mexico, Portugal, or certain parts of the United States]] can substantially reduce living expenses, offering more affordable housing and groceries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Harsh Winters
Canada's severe winters, characterized by temperatures well below zero and months of snowfall, prompt many to seek milder climates, trading snow shovels for beach towels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Healthcare System Challenges
Despite being free and publicly funded, Canada's healthcare system faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Issues include long wait times for medical services and a low doctor-to-population ratio, leading to patient dissatisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. According to the Commonwealth Fund, Canada ranks poorly among high-income countries for specialist wait times and elective surgeries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Adventure and Personal Growth
Living abroad offers opportunities for adventure and new experiences, allowing individuals to immerse themselves in diverse cultures, cuisines, and ways of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This can provide significant opportunities for personal growth and learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Many Canadians assume that [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] are a straightforward choice for saving money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, costly misconceptions can lead to regrets and tax headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article breaks down four significant tax regrets and traps associated with [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] and how to prevent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Inflexibility and Tax Consequences of RRSP Withdrawals

One major regret among [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] contributors is the inflexibility of accessing their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Unlike a TFSA, where withdrawals are tax-free and contribution room is restored, [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] come with steep tax consequences and permanently reduced contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Those who need quick access to savings for emergencies often regret locking their money away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Withdrawals Taxed as Income

Every dollar withdrawn from an [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] is taxed as income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, potentially pushing individuals into a higher marginal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

> For example, Lisa, earning $65,000 annually, withdraws $20,000 from her [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] for home repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Her taxable income jumps to $85,000, significantly increasing her tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Unlike a TFSA, she cannot re-contribute the money, permanently reducing her retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### The Withholding Tax Surprise

Another common regret is underestimating the automatic withholding tax on [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. A portion is deducted upfront, leaving less cash than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> For instance, Jeff withdraws $10,000, and his bank withholds 20% ($2,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. If his marginal tax rate is higher than 20%, he'll owe an additional $1,000 at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Similarly, Maria, a retiree, withdraws $25,000, incurring a 30% withholding tax ($7,500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. If her actual income tax rate is higher, she'll pay another $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Many assume the withholding tax is the final amount, leading to a surprise at tax time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Before contributing, consider if the money might be needed before retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. A TFSA or another account might be a better choice in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Tax Refund Disappointments

Canadians often regret [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | contributing to an RRSP]] when their expected tax refund falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. While contributions offer a tax deduction, the actual refund depends on income level and overall tax situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Refund Size and Income Levels

The size of the refund depends on marginal tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A high earner making $100,000 will see a greater benefit than someone earning $45,000, whose lower tax rate yields a much smaller refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Many regret not realizing [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] favor higher earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Wasting the Refund

Even with a substantial refund, many regret not using it wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Spending it on non-essential purchases defeats the purpose of the [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP's]] tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A smarter approach would be to use the refund to pay down high-interest debt or invest in a TFSA for tax-free growth and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

For some, especially low-income earners, a TFSA might have been a better option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[comparison_between_fhsa_and_rrsp | Unlike RRSP withdrawals, which are fully taxable]], TFSA withdrawals are tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Contributing when income is high and withdrawing when it's lower is a more effective strategy for maximizing tax savings with [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Investing Without a Clear Strategy

Many Canadians regret [[lack_of_investment_strategy_in_rrsps | contributing to an RRSP without a solid investment plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The wide array of investment choices can lead to paralysis or taking on too much risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Decision Paralysis from Too Many Choices

[[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] allow investments in stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, GICs, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This can be overwhelming, causing some to leave funds in cash or low-interest savings, missing out on potential growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Others might follow high-fee mutual fund recommendations without understanding how much fees eat into long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Taking on Too Much Risk

Some [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] holders go "all in" on high-risk stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Without understanding market volatility, panic can set in during market drops, leading to selling at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Not diversifying their portfolio means risk without strategy becomes gambling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Playing it Too Safe

On the flip side, being overly conservative by keeping [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] in low-interest savings accounts, GICs, or money market funds avoids volatility but means money barely keeps up with inflation, limiting retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

To avoid [[lack_of_investment_strategy_in_rrsps | RRSP investment regrets]], start with a clear strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Choose investments that match your risk tolerance, balancing growth (e.g., stocks) with stability (e.g., bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Opt for low-cost ETFs or index funds over high-fee mutual funds, and ensure cash isn't sitting idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. More details on this can be found in the video about [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP millionaire secrets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## RRSP Withdrawal Challenges in Retirement

Many retirees regret not properly planning their [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, leading to higher taxes, lost government benefits, and forced withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. An [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] refund can be compared to a boomerang â€“ it feels good initially, but later "swings back" with taxes on withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Unexpected Tax on Withdrawals

Every [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawal]] is fully taxable income, significantly affecting retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

> For example, David, who earns $40,000 from CPP and a pension, withdraws $50,000 from his [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] for home renovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This increases his taxable income to $90,000, triggering a much larger tax bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He could have reduced this burden by withdrawing smaller amounts over multiple years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Forced Withdrawals at Age 71

By age 71, [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] must be converted into a [[converting_rrsp_to_rrif_for_tax_efficiency | RRIF]], requiring mandatory withdrawals annually, whether the retiree needs the income or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

> Michael, with $500,000 in his [[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSP]] at age 71, must withdraw around 5%, or $26,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This increases his taxable income to $76,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. As he ages, higher withdrawal rates compound the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Losing OAS Benefits

Large [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] can push retirees over the Old Age Security (OAS) clawback threshold, which was around $91,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This can reduce or eliminate OAS payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Many regret not spreading out withdrawals earlier to avoid losing thousands in government benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

[[common_mistakes_rrsp_millionaires_make | RRSPs]] can be a powerful tool, but only if used wisely and with proper planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

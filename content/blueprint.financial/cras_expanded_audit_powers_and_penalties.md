The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is increasing its enforcement efforts, citing a shortfall of over $20 billion annually in tax revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This has led to a rise in audits, harsher penalties, and more Canadians being flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## New Audit Powers Introduced in Budget 2024

The CRA is set to gain sweeping new audit powers, aiming for more aggressive and potentially invasive tax enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These changes, introduced in [[budget 2024]], are designed to crack down on unpaid taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The government argues that enforcement hasn't been strong enough, pointing to a more than $20 billion tax gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, these proposals also raise concerns about fairness, due process, and the increasing burden on taxpayers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

If passed into law, routine audits could involve court orders, mandatory sworn statements, and financial penalties even before the audit is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Proposed Penalties and Changes

### Fines for Non-Compliance
[[budget 2024]] proposes fines for non-compliance with audit requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. If a taxpayer does not fully cooperate, the CRA can issue a **Notice of Non-Compliance (NNC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This NNC can result in a fine of $50 per day, up to $25,000, until the issue is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Paused Reassessment Periods
The CRA will also be able to pause a taxpayer's reassessment period, effectively extending how long they can conduct an audit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If a taxpayer challenges an NNC or fights a CRA demand in court, their reassessment period will not expire and can be extended indefinitely until the case is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Questioning Under Oath
A significant shift from current procedures, the CRA will have the power to compel taxpayers to provide oral statements under oath or affirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Unlike court testimony, this process may not necessarily include standard legal protections or formal transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Severe Compliance Penalties
Failure to comply with a court-issued order could lead to a **10% penalty** on the total tax bill for the years in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This fine can be triggered even by withholding a single document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Impact on Taxpayers
These expanded powers mean that audits could become more aggressive, time-consuming, and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Even routine audits could evolve into legal and financial headaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Taxpayers might face:
*   Penalties imposed even before the audit concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   Being forced to give statements under oath without standard legal protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Increased time and money spent responding to CRA requests, even for minor issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Protecting Yourself
To minimize the risk of an audit and navigate these new powers:
*   **Prepare for stricter audits**: If audited, get organized and respond quickly with well-kept records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Seek legal advice**: Consult legal professionals before providing statements under oath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

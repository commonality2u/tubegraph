The imposition of new tariffs by US President Donald Trump on imports from Canada has introduced significant uncertainty and pressure on the Canadian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Economic Pressure and Investment Concerns

This latest trade dispute places additional strain on Canada's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The threats from US tariffs could potentially drive businesses and investments southward, further exacerbating existing high business costs in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. With businesses and investors already anticipating economic fallout, the Canadian government may need to prioritize defending Canadian industries over implementing unpopular tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Influence on Capital Gains Tax Decisions

The uncertainty introduced by the Trump tariffs is a factor making the proposed [[future_scenarios_for_canada_capital_gains_tax | capital gains tax]] hike in Canada even less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The new deferral of the tax increase, combined with the US tariffs, contributes to an estimated 80% chance of a full reversal of the capital gains tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

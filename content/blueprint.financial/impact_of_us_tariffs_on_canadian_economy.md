US President Donald Trump has imposed new tariffs on imports from Canada, creating a new trade dispute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This development significantly impacts the Canadian economy and adds pressure on the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Economic Pressure and Government Priorities

The introduction of new tariffs places additional strain on the Canadian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Businesses and investors are already anticipating economic fallout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. In response, the Canadian government may need to prioritize defending Canadian industries over implementing unpopular tax increases, such as the capital gains tax hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Discouraging Investment

The threat of US tariffs could further incentivize businesses and investments to shift southward, away from Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This situation is particularly challenging given that Canada already faces high business costs, including significant corporate tax rates, regulations, and labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The tariffs, combined with these existing challenges, make it more difficult for Canadian companies to grow, sell, or reinvest within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

The presence of Trump tariffs is considered a factor that makes a full reversal of the capital gains tax hike in Canada highly likely, with one estimate suggesting an 80% chance of such a reversal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

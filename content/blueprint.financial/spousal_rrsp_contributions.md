[[spousal_rsp_contributions | Spousal RRSP contributions]] are a tax-saving strategy often overlooked by couples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18">[02:18]</a>. Instead of solely contributing to one's own RRSP, contributions can be made to a spousal RRSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20">[02:20]</a>.

## Benefits of Spousal RRSP Contributions
The primary benefit of a spousal RRSP is that it helps distribute retirement income between spouses, thereby reducing overall household taxes in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26">[02:26]</a>. This strategy is particularly advantageous when one spouse earns significantly more than the other, as it offers a chance to lower future tax liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30">[02:30]</a>.

Additionally, the contributor still receives an immediate tax deduction when making the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36">[02:36]</a>. However, when the funds are eventually withdrawn, they are taxed under the spouse's potentially lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39">[02:39]</a>. This contrasts with the [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax implications of RRSP withdrawals]] if the funds were in the higher-earning spouse's individual RRSP.

## Overlooked Opportunity
Despite the substantial savings potential, many couples fail to consider or implement spousal RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33">[02:33]</a>.

Spousal RRSP contributions offer a straightforward yet impactful method for couples to distribute their tax obligations during retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This strategy involves the higher-income spouse contributing to an RRSP established in the lower-income spouse's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The contributing spouse immediately receives a tax deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Later, when the lower-income spouse makes withdrawals in retirement, they are taxed at their typically lower marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Benefits

This approach is particularly beneficial for [[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | balancing retirement incomes]], especially in situations where one spouse has a workplace pension or there is a significant age disparity between partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It effectively "levels the playing field" to maximize savings and minimize overall household taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## How it Works

Consider Ted and Robin's retirement plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>:
*   Ted earns $120,000 annually and is taxed at 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Robin earns $40,000 annually and is taxed at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Their objective is to [[managing_rrsp_and_tfsa_contributions | equalize their retirement savings]], especially since Ted possesses a work pension and Robin does not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Ted contributes $12,000 to a spousal RRSP in Robin's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Immediate Tax Deduction

Ted's contribution reduces his taxable income, resulting in an immediate tax saving of $4,200 (35% of $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Future Tax Efficiency

When Robin withdraws the funds in retirement, she is taxed at her lower 20% rate, paying $2,400 (20% of $12,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This leads to a net household tax saving of $1,800 by shifting the income to Robin's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

The core of this strategy lies in anticipating which partner will have a lower income in retirement and leveraging [[spousal_rrsp_contributions_in_canada | spousal RRSPs]] to benefit from that fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Pro Tips

*   **Avoid Early Withdrawals**: If the spouse receiving the contribution (e.g., Robin) withdraws funds within three years of the contributing spouse's (e.g., Ted's) contribution, the withdrawn amount will be attributed back to the contributing spouse and taxed at their higher marginal rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Plan for Equal Balances**: Strive for comparable RRSP balances between spouses to prevent uneven retirement incomes and potential tax inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Consider Age Differences**: For couples with a notable age gap, strategize contributions to ensure balanced withdrawals are possible throughout retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Combined Strategies

[[rrsp_income_splitting_for_tax_efficiency | Income splitting]] strategies can be combined for greater impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. For example, a couple might begin by contributing to an FHSA for one partner to claim a tax deduction, then utilize pension splitting in retirement to balance income, and further reduce household taxes by making [[spousal_rrsp_contributions_in_canada | spousal RRSP contributions]] to create more tax-deferred savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. These strategies, when integrated, can seamlessly lower taxes, balance income streams, and help achieve financial objectives such as homeownership or a stress-free retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

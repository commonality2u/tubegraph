Many couples often overlook spousal [[spousal_rrsp_contributions_for_tax_efficiency | RRSP contributions]] as a tax-saving strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## How it Works
Instead of solely maximizing your own [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP]] contributions, you can contribute to a spousal [[rrsp_contribution_strategies | RRSP]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Benefits
*   **Income Spreading** This strategy helps to spread out retirement income between spouses, which can significantly reduce the overall household tax burden in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Immediate Tax Deduction** The contributor still receives an immediate tax deduction for the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Lower Future Taxes** When the money is eventually withdrawn, it is taxed under the spouse's potentially lower tax rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Ideal Scenario
This approach is particularly beneficial for couples where one spouse earns substantially more than the other, presenting a significant opportunity to lower future tax bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Despite the potential for significant savings, many individuals do not consider or are unaware of this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

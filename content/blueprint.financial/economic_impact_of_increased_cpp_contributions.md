The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) has undergone significant changes since 2019, including the introduction of the CPP2 enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some view these changes as a "scam or a ripoff," others consider them a "crucial necessity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These enhancements aim to increase the income replacement rate of [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP benefits]] for retirees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, the increased contributions required for these enhancements have raised [[pros_and_cons_of_cpp_enhancements | concerns about their economic impact]] on workers, employers, and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## How CPP Contributions Have Changed

The [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] now involves two tiers of contributions with updated thresholds and rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

*   **Regular CPP Contributions**: Calculated on earnings up to the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE), which is $71,400 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Employers match employee contributions, and self-employed individuals pay the combined rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The contribution rate increased from 4.95% to 5.95% in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **CPP2 Contributions**: Apply to earnings between the YMPE and the Year's Additional Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YAMPE), capped at $81,200 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. There are no further contributions beyond the YAMPE for incomes above $81,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

For instance, an individual earning $81,300 in 2025 would contribute a total of approximately $4,420 (including both regular and CPP2 contributions), which would be matched by their employer, totaling close to $9,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Self-employed individuals are responsible for both the employee and employer portions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Criticisms and Economic Concerns

Despite the intent to provide greater financial security, the [[pros_and_cons_of_cpp_enhancements | CPP enhancements]] have faced several criticisms regarding their economic impact:

### Financial Strain on Workers and Employers

Increased contributions lead to less take-home pay for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This is particularly challenging when living costs and inflation are already squeezing budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Employers are also affected, as they must match these increased contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. For smaller businesses, this can result in difficult decisions regarding hiring or cutting back in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. There is also a hidden cost, as employers might offset these expenses by paying employees less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. For self-employed individuals, managing cash flow becomes harder as they bear both portions of the contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

> "We've heard firsthand from many clients concerned about the impact of these enhancements, especially employers struggling with the added costs for their teams." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>

### Broader Economic Concerns

On a larger scale, there are worries about the overall impact on the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. If employees have less disposable income, they are likely to spend less, which could slow down economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Higher payroll costs for businesses might deter them from growing or investing in new opportunities, potentially affecting jobs and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Debates About Mandatory Contributions

The mandatory nature of [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP contributions]] also sparks debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Many argue that personal savings options, such as RRSPs and TFSAs, offer greater flexibility and control, allowing individuals to decide how much to save and where to invest based on their specific goals and circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Some express a desire for an option to opt out of the [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]], at least partially, if certain criteria like asset levels or net worth are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

> "My personal take is that I could see both sides of the argument I understand the need to protect vulnerable Canadians but the recent enhancements and increases do feel like a lot to me especially as a business owner and someone who likes to control their own Investments." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>

## Government's Rationale

The government implemented these enhancements to strengthen the first pillar of Canada's retirement income system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This was in response to shifts in the retirement landscape, particularly the decline of traditional defined benefit pension plans in favor of defined contribution plans, which place investment risk on employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The enhanced [[canada_pension_plan_cpp_benefits | CPP]] aims to provide a stable, inflation-adjusted, and guaranteed income foundation that retirees can depend on, regardless of market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This reduces dependence on uncertain sources like personal savings and workplace pensions, creating a more balanced approach to retirement planning and helping Canadians navigate rising costs, longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancies]], and evolving financial risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

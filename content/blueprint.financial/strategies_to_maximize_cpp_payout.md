Most Canadians do not receive anywhere near the maximum Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefit, which is around $2,034 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Even after decades of contributions, the average payment for those collecting at age 60 is only about $530 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Understanding the [[factors_affecting_cpp_payouts | factors affecting CPP payouts]] and implementing specific [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | strategies to optimize CPP benefits]] can significantly increase your monthly retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Factors Influencing CPP Payouts

Three primary [[factors_affecting_maximum_cpp_benefit | factors affecting maximum CPP benefit]] determine your CPP payout:

### 1. Earning a High Salary (Maximum Contribution Level)
To achieve the maximum CPP payout, your salary and income must meet the maximum contribution level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, what constitutes the maximum has changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

*   **CPP2 and Second Earning Ceiling**: Starting in 2024, CPP introduced a second earning ceiling, known as the Year's Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. In 2024, the YMPE is $81,300, which is the annual income required to receive maximum CPP payments upon retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Historical Increases**: The maximum threshold has steadily increased, making it more challenging to reach the maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For instance:
    *   1990: $28,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
    *   2000: $37,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
    *   2010: $47,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   **Impact**: A salary considered high enough to maximize CPP in the past would not be sufficient today, and this trend of rising thresholds is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Example**: Someone like James, who earned at least the maximum YMPE for nearly four decades and started collecting at age 60, would receive around $917 per month, which is less than half of the maximum payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Even with a high income, you may not get near the maximum CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### 2. Delaying CPP Payments
The timing of when you start collecting CPP significantly impacts your payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The longer you wait, the higher your monthly payments will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

*   **Payment Changes Based on Start Age**:
    *   **Age 60**: Average monthly payment is $540, with a maximum possible amount of $917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Starting at 60 reduces your payments by about 36% for life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Age 65**: Average jumps to $811, with a maximum of $1,433 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   **Age 70**: Delaying until age 70 boosts your pay by 42% compared to taking it at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Inflation Indexing**: CPP is indexed to inflation, meaning your payments will continue to rise over time to keep up with the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Recent higher inflation rates have led to significant increases in CPP payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Old Age Security (OAS)**: Consider delaying OAS alongside CPP, as it also increases by 0.6% per month after age 65, potentially making a big difference in retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Considerations**: While delaying offers huge financial benefits, less than 2% of Canadians delay CPP until 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The decision on when to start CPP should consider [[factors_influencing_the_decision_on_when_to_start_cpp | factors influencing the decision on when to start CPP]] such as life expectancy, financial situation, and income needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### 3. Contribution Gaps
CPP is based on your lifetime contributions, not just your income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. To receive the maximum CPP payout, you generally need at least 39 years of maximum contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Many people fall short due to gaps in their contribution history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Common reasons for contribution gaps include:
*   **Career Breaks**: Time off for education, sabbaticals, or child care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Self-Employment/Business Ownership**: Paying lower or inconsistent CPP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Periods of Unemployment**: Missing years can drag down your average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Early Retirement or Late Workforce Entry**: Not having the full 39 years of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

*   **Example**: Elaine received the full $2,034 per month at age 70 because she had 39 years of maximum contributions with no gaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. However, Jerry, who also delayed CPP to 70 but had many contribution gaps (e.g., for starting a business, going back to school, or unemployment), ended up with less than a full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

*   **General Dropout Provision**: CPP uses your best 39 years of contributions to calculate your retirement benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The general dropout provision allows you to exclude up to 17% of your lowest-earning months from the calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Since CPP considers 47 years of potential contributions (ages 18-65), this means you can drop about 8 years of low or zero contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If you delay CPP to 70, your total working period extends to 52 years, but the dropout period remains roughly 8 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If you miss more than 8 years of contributions, your final payout will be lower, even if you earned a high salary and delayed CPP to 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Strategies to Maximize Your CPP Payout

To get the maximum CPP payout, it's essential to optimize all three of these [[tools_and_strategies_for_optimizing_cpp_benefits | tools and strategies for optimizing CPP benefits]]:

1.  **Delay CPP as Late as Possible (Ideally Until 70)**:
    *   This is often the easiest way to increase your payout, as it doesn't require earning more or changing your work history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
    *   Delaying past 65 increases your CPP by 8.4% per year, resulting in a 42% boost at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Conversely, starting before 65 decreases your CPP by 7.2% per year, leading to a 36% reduction at age 60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   Careful [[financial_and_actuarial_considerations_in_cpp_planning | financial and actuarial considerations in CPP planning]] are required. Plan to have other income sources like investments (TFSAs, RRSPs) to cover expenses while waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

2.  **Earn at Least the YMPE or Higher for as Many Years as Possible**:
    *   This is the most challenging factor to influence immediately, but increasing your income over time directly increases your CPP payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   **Negotiate Higher Wages and Promotions**: The more you earn, the more you contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
    *   **Start a Side Hustle or Business**: Ensure you contribute to CPP if you are self-employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
    *   **Level Up Your Skills**: Invest in certifications, training, or new skills to secure higher-paying jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   **Switch Jobs Strategically**: Changing employers can often lead to faster salary growth than staying in the same position for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

3.  **Avoid Contribution Gaps and Maximize Your Contribution Years**:
    *   Even if you delay CPP and earn a high salary, too many missing years will prevent you from getting the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   Aim to work for at least 39 years with strong contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Remember CPP allows you to drop up to 8 years of lower or no contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>; missing more than that will lower your payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
    *   **Utilize the Child Rearing Provision**: If you took time off to raise children under seven, this provision can exclude those low-income years from your calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Maximizing your CPP involves a "three-legged stool" approach, where your payout depends on salary, timing, and consistency of contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. A weakness in any one of these areas can make your overall benefit unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Making smart decisions and applying the right [[strategies_to_optimize_cpp_benefits | strategies to optimize CPP benefits]] can mean hundreds more per month in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

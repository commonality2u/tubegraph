When planning to permanently leave Canada, understanding how your Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) is affected is crucial to avoid losing thousands of dollars [00:00:01].

## Contributions and Withdrawals

As a non-resident, you can still contribute to your RRSP if you have available contribution room from Canadian-earned income [00:03:29]. However, without Canadian income, you will not generate new contribution room as a non-resident [00:03:41]. This differs from the rules for a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) [00:03:39].

Any withdrawals you make from your RRSP as a non-resident are subject to a 25% Canadian [[withholding_tax_surprises_for_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] [00:03:46]. This rate can be reduced if there is a tax treaty between Canada and your new country of residence [00:03:52].

## Tax Implications

Your RRSP investments will continue to grow tax-deferred in Canada [00:04:00]. However, your new country of residence might tax the income or gains within your RRSP [00:04:05], leading to [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | tax implications of RRSP withdrawals]]. This varies by country, and some tax treaties may offer tax relief or exemption [00:04:10]. For example, the US will not tax the income or gains within your RRSP due to the tax treaty between Canada and the US [00:04:14]. Other countries may, depending on their tax treaty with Canada [00:04:19]. Canada has tax treaties with 91 countries, including the US, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Thailand [00:04:23].

## Managing Your RRSP

You can keep your RRSP open and continue to manage your investments even as a non-resident, aiding in [[managing_canadian_income_after_becoming_a_nonresident | managing Canadian income after becoming a nonresident]] [00:04:35]. Be mindful of currency conversion rates and fees, as these can impact your returns when you plan to withdraw funds [00:04:40].

### Converting to a RRIF

As a non-resident, you can convert your RRSP to a Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) [00:04:49]. Withdrawals from your RRIF will have similar [[withholding_tax_surprises_for_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax rules]], typically 25%, unless a tax treaty reduces it [00:04:56]. Minimum withdrawals are based on your age and the value of your RRIF, just as if you were living in Canada [00:05:03].

For example, if you are moving to the US, the tax treaty between Canada and the US can reduce the [[withholding_tax_surprises_for_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] rates on RRSP withdrawals to 15% for periodic withdrawals [00:05:11]. The specific tax treaty of your destination country is key [00:05:20].

> [!WARNING]
> It can get complicated, so always check the specific tax treaty details for the country you plan to move to [00:05:09].

## Repatriation

If you decide to return to Canada, you can resume contributing to your RRSP based on the contribution room from any new Canadian income you generate [00:05:26].

For this group, the median income was $193,800, and the average income was $269,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Key Trends Among Top Earners

Data from 2018 to 2022 reveals several interesting trends among high earners in Canada:

*   **Rising Entry Bar**
    *   The threshold to enter the top 10% rose by 14.3% from $97,000 to approximately $111,000 between 2018 and 2022, indicating higher overall income levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   The minimum income needed to reach the top 5% increased by 16.3% between 2018 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This gap is influenced by a small number of ultra-high earners, such as billionaires like Jim Patterson, who significantly skew the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   For the top 5%, the average income was over $75,000 more than the median <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   In the top 1%, the average income was nearly $200,000 higher than the median, signifying significant income concentration among the ultra-elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Economic Resilience**
    *   Despite events like the COVID-19 pandemic, top earners experienced substantial income growth, suggesting this segment is relatively insulated from broader economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Growing Inequality**
    *   Both median and average incomes within the top 10% are rising faster than national income averages, indicating a widening of income inequality in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   For the top 1%, median income rose by nearly 14.7% and average incomes rose by 18.3%, outpacing both inflation and broader wage growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **High Tax Contribution**
    *   The top 5% of earners paid an average of $87,700 in income taxes in 2022, contributing over 41% of all federal and provincial personal income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   The top 1% earners paid an average of $231,600 in income taxes in 2022, contributing over 22% of all federal and provincial income taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Consistent Membership**
    *   Roughly 76% of top 5% earners in 2022 were also in this group the previous year, and 86% had been in the top 5% at least once in the prior 5 years, suggesting long-term presence at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   Around 69% of top 1% earners in 2022 were also in the 1% the year before, and 96% had been in the top 5% at least once in the past 5 years. It is difficult to join this group, but once in, many tend to remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Financial Strategies Employed by High Earners

While individual approaches vary, high earners often employ structured [[strategies_to_manage_personal_finances_in_canada | financial strategies]] to maximize their income and wealth:

*   **David (Top 10%):** He is intentional with his money and automates contributions to his RSPs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He also tracks his wealth using tools like a net worth tracker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Rachel (Top 5%):** Each year, she maxes out her RRSPs and TFSAs, contributes to her kids' RESPs, and invests additional funds in a taxable account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These are examples of [[tax_saving_strategies_on_investments_in_canada | tax-saving strategies on investments in Canada]].
*   **Mark (Top 1%):** He maxes out his RRSPs, TFSA, and RSP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Most of his wealth is held within a holding company, invested in real estate, stocks, and private deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. He relies on an advisory team that meets quarterly to manage his finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Mark also gives back by donating to youth mental health causes and setting up a donor-advised fund to involve his kids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This points to [[taxefficient_investment_strategies_in_canada | tax-efficient investment strategies]] and potentially [[tax_strategies_for_selfemployed_business_owners_in_canada | tax strategies for self-employed business owners]].

High earners prioritize building freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth through careful income management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The story of Ronald Reed, a janitor who amassed an $8 million fortune through simple, consistent investing, highlights that high income is not the only path to wealth; making every dollar count is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Comparison to Average Canadian Income

There is a stark contrast between the incomes of top earners and the average Canadian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The median income for most Canadians ranges from $35,000 to about $60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The highest median income for Canadians aged 45 to 54 is still $51,500 below the top 10% threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The top 5% threshold of $147,100 is more than double what most Canadians earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. To enter the top 1%, one needs to earn nearly six times more than the average 25 to 34-year-old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

Income is just the starting point; what one does with that income builds freedom, flexibility, and long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Whether in the top or bottom income brackets, developing a smarter financial plan around one's income is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

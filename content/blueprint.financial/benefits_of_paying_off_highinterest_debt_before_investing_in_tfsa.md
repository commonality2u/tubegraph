A significant mistake some individuals make is investing in a [[Taxfree savings account TFSA strategies | TFSA]] before settling high-interest debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While it might seem logical to begin investing right away, addressing high-interest obligations, such as credit card balances, is often the more prudent financial strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This approach is one of several [[avoiding_tfsa_investment_pitfalls | TFSA investment pitfalls]] to be mindful of.

## The High Cost of Debt

Credit card interest rates can frequently reach 20% or even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. It is exceptionally difficult for any investment to consistently generate returns that match such high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Returns of this magnitude are typically achieved only by elite investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. For context, Warren Buffett, through Berkshire Hathaway, has delivered an average annual return of approximately 20% since 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## An "Effective Return" on Your Money

By prioritizing the repayment of high-interest debt, you are effectively "earning" a return on your money that mirrors the interest rate you avoid paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For example, eliminating debt with a 20% interest rate is comparable to securing a 20% tax-free return on your funds.

## Long-Term Financial Stability

*   **Stronger Financial Position** It establishes a much more robust financial foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Investment Freedom** Once debt-free, you gain greater freedom to invest without the burden of ongoing high-interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Optimized TFSA Growth** You can then invest more effectively, allowing your [[benefits_of_the_tfsa | TFSA]] to grow without the counteracting drain of interest from debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

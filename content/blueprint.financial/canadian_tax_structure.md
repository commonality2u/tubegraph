Canada operates under a progressive tax system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This means that different portions of an individual's income are taxed at different rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Understanding Progressive Taxation

In a progressive tax system, an individual's income is divided into segments, each subject to a specific [[tax_brackets_in_canada | federal tax bracket]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For example, if the income threshold for a 20.5% tax bracket is $57,375, and the previous bracket is 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
*   Any income *below* $57,375 is taxed at the 15% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Only the portion of income *above* $57,375 is taxed at the higher 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Common Misconception

A common myth is that earning a raise that pushes an individual into a higher [[tax_brackets_in_canada | tax bracket]] will result in taking home less money overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is incorrect because only the income *above* the bracket threshold is taxed at the higher rate, not the entire income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Therefore, it is always financially beneficial to receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

> An employee earning $56,000 annually is in a 15% federal tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If they receive a raise to $60,000, crossing the $57,375 income threshold for the 20.5% bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:

> *   Only the $2,625 difference ($60,000 - $57,375) is taxed at the 20.5% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

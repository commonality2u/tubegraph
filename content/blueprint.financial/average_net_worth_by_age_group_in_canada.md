Net worth evolves through different stages of life, reflecting the financial journey most people experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Examining the average net worth by age group in Canada from 2020 to 2024 provides insight into typical financial progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This [[net_worth_classification_in_canada | net worth classification in Canada]] reveals how asset accumulation and debt management shift over time.

## Net Worth Progression by Age Group

### Under 35 Years

In the early career phase, net worth tends to be lower as individuals build assets and manage debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
Canadians under 35 saw their net worth grow from $231,000 in 2020 to $338,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Financial volatility is common in this group, often due to factors like student loans and early career challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### 35 to 44 Years

As individuals enter their 30s and 40s, net worth generally grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. By 2024, the average net worth for this group reached $658,000, an increase from $490,000 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This is considered a key stage for investing in assets like real estate and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 45 to 54 Years & 55 to 64 Years

Net worth typically peaks in these two age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In 2024:
*   Those aged 45 to 54 had an average net worth of $1.35 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Those aged 55 to 64 reached $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This growth is largely driven by real estate appreciation and retirement savings accumulation, marking the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### 65 Years and Older (De-accumulation Phase)

In retirement, net worth tends to plateau or grow modestly as individuals begin drawing down assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For those over 65, net worth increased from $863,000 in 2020 to $1.12 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, this figure is lower than the peak age groups, indicating that assets are being utilized for retirement living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Using Net Worth Data for Financial Improvement

Net worth data can be a valuable tool for setting realistic financial goals and building wealth strategically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

*   **Set Realistic Goals:** Use average net worth data for your age group to understand your standing and set achievable targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. For instance, if the average for your age group is $400,000, aim to gradually surpass that benchmark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Investing:** Wealthy households grow their net worth through investing, not solely by earning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Evaluate your assets and ensure you are investing sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Optimize Financial Assets:** Focusing on optimizing financial assets using vehicles like RRSPs, TFSAs, and other investment options is crucial for long-term wealth accumulation, especially for Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Leverage Real Estate:** Real estate plays a significant role in wealth building in Canada, making up over 50% of the average Canadian's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If home ownership is a goal, work towards it, or consider how to leverage property you already own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Benchmark and Track Progress:** Utilize strategies from top earners, such as minimizing debt and diversifying investments, to guide your financial plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Regularly track and adjust your strategy to stay on course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

While comparison can be motivating, it's important to focus on your unique financial journey and celebrate your progress rather than constantly comparing yourself to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Building net worth is not just about earning more, but about having a proper strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

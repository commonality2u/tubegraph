From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

This article explores how net worth in Canada stacks up against the average, focusing on specific age groups and other contributing factors. Canadian household net worth has steadily increased from 2020 to 2024, rising from approximately $762,000 to over $1 million by 2022, primarily driven by real estate and financial market gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Despite a slight dip in 2023 to about $979,000 due to inflation and post-pandemic spending, it recovered to over $1 million by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Real Estate's Role in Canadian Net Worth

[[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | Real estate]] plays a significant role in Canadian wealth, making up over 50% of household [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] during this period, peaking at nearly 56% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This highlights Canadians' reliance on property for building and storing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. While real estate drove much of the [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] increase from $762,000 in 2020 to over $1 million in 2024, heavy reliance on it means any downturn in the housing market could significantly impact households' net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> While [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | real estate]] might feel like a safe bet, diversifying your portfolio across [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | real estate]], stocks, bonds, and other assets is important to protect against potential downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Homeowners Versus Renters: A Growing Wealth Gap

There is a striking wealth gap between homeowners and renters in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. In 2024, homeowners had an average [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] of $1.38 million, nearly five times higher than renters, who averaged $274,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Both groups experienced steady growth from 2020 to 2024, with homeowners seeing a 33% increase and renters growing by 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The primary driver of this disparity is [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | real estate]] appreciation, which significantly boosts homeowners' [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Average Net Worth by Age Group

[[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | Net worth]] evolves through different stages of life, reflecting typical financial journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Here's how [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] progressed by age group in Canada from 2020 to 2024:

### Under 35 Years of Age
In the early career stage, [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] is typically lower as individuals build assets and manage debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Canadians under 35 saw their [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] grow from $231,000 in 2020 to $338,000 in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Financial volatility is common in this group due to factors like student loans and early career challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### 35 to 44 Years of Age
As individuals enter their 30s and 40s, [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] typically grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. By 2024, the average [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] for this group reached $658,000, up from $490,000 in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This is a key stage for investing in assets like [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | real estate]] and retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 45 to 64 Years of Age (Peak Wealth Accumulation)
[[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | Net worth]] peaks in these two age groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. In 2024:
*   Those aged 45 to 54 had $1.35 million in [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Those aged 55 to 64 reached $1.6 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
This growth is largely driven by [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | real estate]] and retirement savings growth, marking the strongest wealth accumulation phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### 65 Years and Older (De-accumulation Phase)
In retirement, [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] plateaus or grows modestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For those over 65, [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] rose from $863,000 in 2020 to $1.12 million in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This age group begins drawing down assets, which typically leads to a drop in [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] compared to the peak accumulation phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Net Worth by Household Type

A clear wealth gap exists between one-person and multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. By 2024, multi-person households had nearly double the [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] of one-person households ($1.17 million versus $634,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This difference is mainly due to multi-person households having larger total assets ($1.4 million versus $74,000), often because of two income providers and shared expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

However, one-person households are closing the gap in terms of growth: from 2020 to 2024, their [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] increased by 40% compared to 29.4% for multi-person households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | Real estate]] plays a major role for both groups, making up 55% of [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] for multi-person households and 45% for one-person households, suggesting multi-person households may be more able to afford property in the Canadian housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## The Top 1% Net Worth in Canada

According to a 2021 report from the PBO, the threshold for being in the top 1% of [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] in Canada is having assets of at least $6.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This group includes approximately 160,000 families in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The report also highlights that wealth is increasingly concentrated, with the top 1% holding nearly 24.8% of the total [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net wealth]] in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Median Versus Average Net Worth

When looking at [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] numbers, it's important to understand the difference between median and average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The median is a better measure because it represents the middle point, where half of households have more and half have less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The average can be skewed by the ultra-wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. For instance, in 2019, the median [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] for multi-person households was $514,000, but the average in 2020 was $97,000, distorted by individuals with significantly higher net worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. While Statistics Canada stopped reporting median [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] after 2019, a typical household's [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] is likely around 50% lower than the average today, offering a more realistic picture of financial standing for most Canadians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Net Worth by Income Level

[[strategies_for_increasing_income_and_net_worth_in_canada | Net worth]] generally correlates with income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. In 2024, the top 20% of income earners had a staggering [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] of over $2.29 million, more than six times that of the bottom 20%, who were at $375,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The top group gained almost $460,000 in just four years, further widening the wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

However, middle-income households (41% to 80% income group) saw the fastest percentage growth in [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]], quietly building wealth from rising [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | real estate]] and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This indicates that significant [[net_worth_growth_in_canada_after_reaching_100000 | net worth growth]] is possible even outside the top income brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Comparing Net Worth Internationally

When comparing [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] internationally (using UBS Global Wealth Data Book figures in US dollars), Canada's average [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] sits between the UK and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Switzerland stands out with an average [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] of $685,000 USD, 85% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The US average is 49% higher than Canada's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Conversely, countries like Germany and China had much lower averages; Germany's average is 31% lower than Canada's, and China's is almost 80% lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Australia's median [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] was 80% higher than Canadians', and its average [[net_worth_benchmarks_for_canadian_social_classes | net worth]] was 34% higher, likely propped up by their significant housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Building your [[canadian_net_worth_trends_from_2020_to_2024 | net worth]] is not just about earning more, but about having a proper strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

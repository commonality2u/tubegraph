The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) introduced a two-tier system in 2025, also known as [[cpp_enhancements_and_changes_since_2019 | CPP enhancement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This system requires higher earners to contribute more to their CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## BCPP (First Tier)

The first tier, known as BCPP, applies to earnings up to \$71,500, which is referred to as the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Employee Contribution**: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
*   **Employer Contribution**: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   **Self-Employed Contribution**: 11.9% (combined employee and employer rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

## CPP2 (Second Tier)

The enhanced CPP, known as CPP2, applies to earnings between \$71,300 and \$81,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Employee Contribution**: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   **Employer Contribution**: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>
*   **Self-Employed Contribution**: 8% (combined rate for this tier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>

### Contribution Cap
Contributions are capped at \$4,420 for incomes over \$81,200 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. A \$3,500 exemption is included in all calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Impact of the Two-Tier System

This new system aims to help higher earners save more for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. With these changes, CPP is expected to replace up to 33.33% of lifetime earnings, an increase from the previous 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

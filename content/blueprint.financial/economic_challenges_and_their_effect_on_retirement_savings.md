The average Canadian's Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) balance experienced a significant drop of over $30,000 in a single year, falling from $144,000 in 2022 to $113,000 in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While this 28% decline might seem alarming for [[consequences_of_inadequate_retirement_savings | retirement savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, it largely reflects a return to more typical savings levels after temporary spikes observed in 2021 and 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These elevated levels were likely driven by pandemic-related savings habits, where people cut expenses and increased contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

Despite a continued focus on [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | financial futures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, economic factors such as the [[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirees | rising cost of living]] and [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | inflation]] are making it increasingly difficult for Canadians to maintain higher levels of contribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Understanding RRSP Data: Median vs. Average

When analyzing RRSP data, median figures offer a more realistic snapshot compared to averages, which can be skewed by high-saving and high-earning outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For example, for individuals aged 65 and older, the median RRSP balance is $224,000, significantly higher than the average of $100,000, indicating the average is heavily influenced by high-income earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The most recent median data, combining RRSPs, RRIFs, and LIRAs from Statistics Canada, dates back to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## RRSP Holdings by Age Group

RRSP holdings vary significantly across different age demographics, highlighting various [[factors_affecting_retiree_financial_security | factors affecting financial security]] at different life stages:

*   **Younger Canadians (Under 35)**: The median savings for this group is just $12,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This emphasizes the critical need for young adults to begin saving consistently as early as possible for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Mid-Life Savings Growth (35-54)**: While savings improve, the median balance, ranging from $30,000 to $70,000, is often far below what is typically required for a secure retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:03:00]</a>. This age group often juggles mortgages, family expenses, and careers, making retirement contributions challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Nearing Retirement (55-64)**: Median savings increase to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. However, this may still be insufficient for comfortable retirement, requiring reliance on additional income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The average for this group is higher, at $216,000, due to high-income outliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Retirees (65+)**: The median savings remain at $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, meaning many retirees heavily depend on government benefits like CPP (Canada Pension Plan) and OAS (Old Age Security) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, facing [[challenges_of_retirement_income_in_canada | challenges of retirement income]] that private savings may not cover.

> [!NOTE] Economic Family Types
> This data includes both combined households and individuals. Households generally show higher savings due to shared financial responsibilities and multiple incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Individuals reviewing this data should consider that their personal savings might be lower than the average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Regional Variations in RRSP Holdings

A 2023 survey revealed regional differences in RRSP engagement across Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:

*   **Ontario** leads with the highest average RRSP balance at $162,900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Atlantic Canada** recorded the highest average contribution at $8,155 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Impact of Household Size on Contributions

Larger households generally contribute more to their RRSPs, likely due to increased income and shared expenses, leading to more discretionary income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:

*   **Two-person households** lead with 4.2 million contributing households and a median contribution of $4,888 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Single-person households** contribute significantly less, with a median of $3,560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

This pattern suggests that dual-income households are better positioned to prioritize and grow their retirement savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## RRSP Contributions at Different Stages of Life

Despite [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | inflation]] and [[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirees | rising costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, Canadians are prioritizing their RRSP contributions. The average contribution increased to $6,651 in 2023, up from $5,750 in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Contributions vary with age, with those closer to retirement typically increasing their savings:

*   **55 and above**: Median contribution of $5,490 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **15 to 24**: Median contribution of $2,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This demonstrates a clear focus on long-term [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | financial security]] as individuals approach retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Economic Challenges Impacting RRSP Savings

Recent economic challenges have significantly impacted Canadians' ability to save for retirement:

*   **Inflation Concerns**: In 2023, 74% of Canadians expressed concerns about how [[inflation_impact_on_retirement_income | inflation]] and [[rising_cost_of_living_and_its_effects_on_retirees | rising prices]] were affecting their finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Negative Economic Conditions**: By 2024, 63% of Canadians reported that current economic conditions were negatively affecting their ability to save for retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Despite these difficulties, Canadians continue to focus on their long-term retirement plans, demonstrating resilience amidst economic turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Regular RRSP contributions remain essential for long-term [[financial_stability_and_retirement_income | security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

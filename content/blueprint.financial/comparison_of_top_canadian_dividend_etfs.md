This article ranks some of the top Canadian dividend ETFs and discusses the overall landscape of dividend ETF selections in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## 5. iShares Canadian Select Dividend Index ETF (XDV)

XDV is designed for investors seeking steady, high-quality dividends from strong Canadian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It tracks the Dow Jones Canada Select Dividend Index, selecting stocks based on dividend yield, payout ratio, and dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Strong Dividend Payers**: Holds 31 high-yielding Canadian stocks chosen for dividend consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Monthly Distributions**: Provides monthly payouts, making it suitable for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Financials Heavy**: Nearly 60% of the ETF is composed of Canada's largest banks and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Performance and Costs
*   **Dividend Yield**: Approximately 4.2% (as of January 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 2.31% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Management Expense Ratio (MER)**: 0.55% per year, which is moderate for a high-yield strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Assets Under Management (AUM)**: $1.76 billion, indicating its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Top Holdings
The fund's top holdings are dominated by Canadian financials (nearly 60% of the portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These include Canadian Tire, RBC, Bank of Montreal, CIBC, and National Bank of Canada, all known for strong balance sheets and consistent dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Who Should Invest?
*   **Ideal for**: Retirees and income investors seeking monthly payouts, and those wanting exposure to Canada's most stable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Not ideal for**: Growth investors, as it prioritizes income over capital appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

XDV is a solid choice for dividend investors who desire monthly income and exposure to stable, high-yield Canadian companies, though its heavy reliance on financial stocks and moderate fees should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## 4. BMO Canadian High Dividend Covered Call ETF (ZWC)

ZWC is a unique income-focused ETF that invests in high-dividend Canadian stocks while employing a covered call strategy to boost income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This strategy results in higher monthly dividends but limits potential upside from stock price growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### How Covered Calls Work
ZWC sells call options on some of its stocks, earning premiums as extra income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This caps potential gains: if stock prices stay flat or fall, ZWC keeps the premium, boosting its dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, if prices rise above the strike price, ZWC must sell at the set price, missing out on larger gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Essentially, ZWC trades growth potential for more stable, high-yield income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Enhanced Income Strategy**: Uses covered calls to generate extra income, leading to a higher-than-average yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Monthly Distributions**: Ideal for retirees or income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Diversified Canadian Portfolio**: Holds 99 stocks, primarily in financials and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Performance and Costs
*   **Dividend Yield**: 6.62% (as of February 27, 2025), higher than average due to the covered call strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 12% return, though its 5-year average is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **MER**: 0.72%, higher than traditional dividend ETFs due to active options management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Trading Expense Ratio (TER)**: 0.20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Total Cost**: 0.92%, making it the most expensive ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **AUM**: $1.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Top Holdings
Heavily weighted towards financials and energy, top holdings include Bank of Nova Scotia, CIBC, Enbridge, Manulife, RBC, and TD Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. These are stable high-yield dividend payers, but the covered call strategy limits growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Who Should Invest?
*   **Best for**: Retirees and income seekers who prioritize consistent cash flow and do not need long-term capital growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Good for**: RSP and [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] investors who want to shield high dividends from taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Not ideal for**: Growth-focused investors, as covered calls limit potential gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

ZWC is a strong choice for investors wanting high monthly income with reduced market volatility, but its covered call strategy makes it better suited for purely income-focused investors rather than long-term growth seekers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## 3. iShares S&P TSX Canadian Dividend Aristocrats Index Fund (CDZ)

CDZ invests in Canadian companies that have increased their dividends every year for at least five consecutive years, known as "Dividend Aristocrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is a solid choice for those seeking stable dividend growth and monthly income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Key Features

*   **Annual Performance (2024)**: 20.07% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **MER**: 0.66% per year, slightly higher than some competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **AUM**: Just under $1 billion, at $940 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### Top Holdings
CDZ is less concentrated in financials compared to other dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Top holdings include BCE, Allied Properties REIT, Fiera Capital, Telus, and Southb Corp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. This diversification helps reduce risk compared to bank-heavy ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Who Should Invest?
*   **Great for**: Dividend growth investors who want increasing payouts over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Potentially more diversified** than other bank-heavy dividend ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Not ideal for**: Maximum yield seekers, as its dividend rates are lower than some other ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

CDZ is a great choice for long-term investors who value steady dividend growth and broad sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. While its yield is lower than covered call ETFs, its focus on companies with strong dividend track records makes it a reliable option for sustainable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> For any of these ETFs, consider setting up a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) to supercharge long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

*   **Best for**: Those comfortable with significant financials and energy sector exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

VDY is a strong low-cost option for investors focused on high monthly dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## 1. iShares Core MSCI Canadian Quality Dividend Index ETF (XD)

XD is the top pick because it prioritizes high-quality dividend stocks with strong financials and a track record of steady or growing payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. It is also the lowest-cost ETF on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Unlike other dividend ETFs with higher fees or concentrated sector risks, XD offers a low-cost, long-term solution for income-focused investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Why Canadian Dividend ETFs Are Not Always Loved Overall

While ETFs in general are positive, [[pros_and_cons_of_canadian_dividend_etfs | Canadian dividend ETFs]] have several downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | Higher Fees]]
[[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | Dividend ETFs]] often come with higher-than-average Management Expense Ratios (MERs) that can significantly reduce returns over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. For example, XDV charges a 0.55% MER but only holds 31 stocks, which is not great diversification for the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. An investment of $1,000 in XDV would incur $5.50 in fees per year, which compounds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. To counteract this, investors should seek lower-MER dividend ETFs, like the top two picks on this list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### [[impact_of_fees_and_diversification_in_dividend_etfs | Less Diversification Than You Think]]
Most Canadian dividend ETFs are heavily concentrated in financials and energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. For instance, VDY has over 85% exposure to just financials and energy, making it vulnerable to sector downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. XDV holds only 31 stocks, and XD holds only 20 stocks, meaning they don't offer broad market exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. In contrast, a truly diversified ETF like Vanguard Growth ETF (VGRO) holds over 13,000 stocks across multiple sectors and geographies, areas where Canadian dividend ETFs are lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For true diversification, dividend ETFs alone might not suffice, and investors might consider building their own portfolio or choosing a globally diversified ETF like VGRO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### US Dividend Stocks Might Be a Better Option
Many of the best dividend stocks are found in the US market, offering higher dividend growth rates, potentially more sector diversification, and more blue-chip companies with global reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Instead of paying ETF fees, investors might be better off investing directly in 10 to 20 high-quality dividend stocks across Canada and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Another strategy could be to combine a Canadian dividend ETF with separate investments in US dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> For US dividend stocks, consider holding them in an RSP rather than a [[features_and_benefits_of_canadas_tfsa | TFSA]] to avoid withholding tax on dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

While Canadian dividend ETFs can be a convenient tool for those who prefer not to buy individual dividend stocks, their high fees, lack of diversification, and reduced control are significant concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

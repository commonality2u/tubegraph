Deciding when to start receiving Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits is a significant retirement choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. While over 95% of Canadians begin CPP at or before age 65, waiting until age 70 can often prove optimal for many, potentially adding over $100,000 in lifetime benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Illustrative Example: Sarah's CPP Payments

To demonstrate the impact of different start ages, consider Sarah, who qualifies for a $1,000 per month CPP payment at age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   If Sarah starts CPP at age 60, her payments would be reduced to $640 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This represents a 36% lifetime reduction compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   If she delays until age 70, her monthly payments would increase to $1,420 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This is a 42% increase in monthly income compared to starting at 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Real-World Scenarios from an Actuarial Report

A detailed 2020 Actuarial study on CPP take-up decisions provides insights into various situations where different start ages might be optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 60
This option is generally best for those with immediate income needs or health concerns leading to a shorter [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It ensures early access to funds but comes with permanent drawbacks, such as reduced lifetime payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

> [!example] John's Scenario: Securing Income and Avoiding Clawbacks
> John is a 60-year-old with health issues and very little savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. He decides to take CPP early to secure immediate income and avoid potential clawbacks on his [[impact_of_cpp_on_other_benefits_like_oas_and_gis | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Starting CPP at Age 65
This is considered the default option, striking a balance by providing steady payments and avoiding the need for other savings to bridge an income gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It's ideal for retirees with below-average to average [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancy]] and moderate estimated investment returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Payments generally equalize with the age 70 option around age 80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

> [!example] Maria's Scenario: Predictable Income
> Maria, age 65, retires with modest Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RSP) savings and average health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. She chooses to start CPP at 65 to maintain a predictable income without having to deplete her savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Delaying CPP to Age 70
Delaying provides the highest guaranteed, inflation-adjusted lifetime income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This option is ideal for those with longer [[impact_of_life_expectancy_on_cpp_decisions | life expectancies]] and sufficient savings to bridge any income gap until age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Waiting until 70 offers an effective return equivalent to 6% to 8% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For most, delaying CPP becomes advantageous after around age 80, when cumulative payments begin to exceed those from earlier options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

> [!example] Susan's Scenario: Maximizing Lifetime Income
> Susan, age 70, expects to live well into her late 80s or 90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. With sufficient RSP funds, she decides to delay CPP, maximizing her lifetime inflation-protected income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## General Observations from Financial Advisors

Financial advisors often find that delaying CPP until the late 60s or 70s is beneficial for their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. However, there are always exceptions where starting earlier may be more advantageous, highlighting the need for individualized scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

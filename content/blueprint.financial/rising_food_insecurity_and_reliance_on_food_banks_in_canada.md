Food insecurity is a growing crisis in Canada, with a significant increase in the number of Canadians struggling to afford basic necessities, including food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The phenomenon extends beyond just [[impact_of_inflation_on_food_prices_in_canada | food inflation]], encompassing broader issues like [[rising_food_and_housing_costs_in_canada | rising food and housing costs in Canada]], utilities, and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Current State of Affordability
According to the 2025 Canada Food Price Report, 45% of Canadians are struggling with day-to-day costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This has led to drastic measures, with 28% of Canadians reporting that they are eating less food, rather than simply switching brands, to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This situation is highlighted as a serious concern for a wealthy country like Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. People are no longer budgeting to get ahead, but to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

Even with strategies like bulk buying, comparing flyers, and cutting impulse spending, many are falling behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This is largely due to expenses outpacing incomes, with a widening gap between earnings and living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Incomes are generally not rising at the same rate as food price increases, such as the projected 3% to 5% food price increase in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Escalating Food Bank Usage
A stark indicator of rising food insecurity is the dramatic increase in food bank visits. In March 2024, there were over 2 million food bank visits, marking a 90% jump since 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Impact on Demographics
*   **Gen Z:** Nearly half of Gen Z individuals have had to dip into savings or borrow money just to afford food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Overall Population:** Across the board, 48% of Canadians are actively seeking discounts not to save money, but to simply get by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Middle-Income Households:** Even middle-income households are feeling the financial strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Consumer Adaptations
Canadians are adopting various [[consumer_reactions_and_adaptations_to_rising_grocery_costs | consumer reactions and adaptations to rising grocery costs]]:
*   **Eating Less:** Over 28% report eating less food overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Skipping Meals:** More people are skipping meals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Cutting Non-Essentials:** Reducing expenses on non-essential items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Lower Quality Food:** Settling for lower quality food options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Shifting Shopping Habits:** Brand loyalty is fading, with a greater emphasis on affordability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Some are cooking more creatively or reducing food waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Many Canadians have already cut back on discretionary spending like takeout, indicating that there is little left to cut from their budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This situation highlights a profound challenge to being able to feed oneself without fear, extending beyond mere budgeting to issues of dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

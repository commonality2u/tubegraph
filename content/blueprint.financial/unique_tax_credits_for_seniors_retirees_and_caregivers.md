The tax deadline is April 30th, and claiming eligible credits can prevent you from missing out on significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Canada offers numerous tax credits, and understanding them is key to maximizing your financial return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While some credits are automatically applied, most require manual claims on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Tax Credits

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

The Basic Personal Amount (BPA) is a non-refundable tax credit that allows Canadians to earn a portion of their income tax-free before federal income tax applies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. For the 2025 tax year, the BPA is $15,129 for individuals with net incomes below the 29% tax bracket threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This credit is automatically applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### For Seniors and Retirees

#### Age Amount Tax Credit
Canadians aged 65 and older can claim the age amount tax credit, a non-refundable credit designed to [[tax_reduction_for_retirees | reduce taxes in retirement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For 2025, the maximum claimable amount is $9,200 of eligible income, which can reduce taxes owed by up to $1,354 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. However, this credit is gradually reduced if your net income exceeds approximately $44,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example, if a 66-year-old earns $42,000, they qualify for the full $9,28 age amount credit, but it starts shrinking at $46,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This tax break helps retirees manage taxable income efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

#### Pension Income Amount
Canadians receiving eligible pension income can claim a non-refundable tax credit on up to $2,000 of pension income at both federal and provincial levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This credit is calculated as 15% of the lesser of $2,000 or eligible pension income received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Any unused portion of this credit can be transferred to a spouse or common-law partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | Pension income splitting]] also allows couples to allocate eligible pension income for tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

#### Home Accessibility Expenses
Seniors and persons with disabilities can claim up to $20,000 in home renovation expenses to improve accessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Eligible expenses include installing ramps, grab bars, walk-in tubs, or lowering cabinets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. This credit can reduce taxes by up to $3,000 (15% of $20,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> and can be combined with the [[eligible_medical_expenses_for_tax_credits | medical expenses tax credit]] for additional savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### For Caregivers and Those with Disabilities

#### Canada Caregiver Amount (CCA)

For the 2025 tax year, eligible individuals can claim up to $8,081 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For a child under 18 with a disability, the credit amount is $2,861 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The credit amount is reduced based on a dependent's net income, and eligibility criteria vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In some cases, additional amounts may be claimed for spouses or common-law partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It's crucial to retain medical documentation if required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

#### Disability Amount
Individuals with severe, prolonged disabilities may qualify for the Disability Tax Credit (DTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Eligible expenses include prescriptions, dental care, vision care, physiotherapy, psychotherapy, other medical treatments, and medical travel expenses if care isn't available locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. To maximize your claim, combine expenses for yourself, your spouse, and dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Keep detailed records and receipts for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## [[how_to_stack_multiple_tax_credits_for_greater_savings | Stacking Multiple Credits for Greater Savings]]

The key to maximizing tax savings is not just knowing about individual credits, but understanding [[how_to_stack_multiple_tax_credits_for_greater_savings | how to stack them together]] for even bigger tax breaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Retirement Tax Saving Combo
A common strategy for retirees involves combining the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income amount]] with the age amount tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income amount]] is up to $2,000 per person, which can reduce taxes for those 65 plus, worth up to $928 federally in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Example**: John and Linda are both retired, with John having a large pension and Linda a smaller income. Since both are over 65, they can each claim the [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | pension income amount]] to lower their taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. John also qualifies for the age amount credit, providing an extra tax break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **Stacked Savings**: [[pension_income_tax_credit_and_rrif_withdrawals | Pension Income Amount]] + Age Amount = Lower Taxes and Bigger Refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Bonus Tip**: Pension income splitting can save even more by shifting some of John's income into Linda's lower tax bracket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Family Tax Saving Combo
Families can combine multiple tax credits to [[reducing_taxes_with_the_canada_workers_benefit_and_other_credits | reduce taxes]] and increase refunds, especially if they have kids or dependents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

*   **Components**:
    *   Canada Child Benefits (CCB): Tax-free monthly payments for parents with kids under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
    *   Child Care Expenses Deduction: Claim daycare, babysitting, or after-school program costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Canada Caregiver Amount: For parents supporting a child with a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Example**: Sarah and Mike have two young kids; their children are in daycare, and one has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   They receive tax-free monthly payments from the Canada Child Benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
    *   Mike claims daycare expenses through the child care expenses deduction, lowering his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   They receive an extra tax credit through the Canada Caregiver Amount since one child has a disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Stacked Savings**: CCB + Child Care Deduction + Caregiver Credit = Thousands of Dollars in Tax Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Bonus Tip**: Families can also split income by contributing to a spousal RRSP to reduce overall household tax liability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

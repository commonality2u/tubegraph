[[Tax loss harvesting and managing capital gains | Tax loss harvesting]] is a strategy that can help individuals save on taxes by using investment losses to offset investment gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:48">[09:48:48]</a>. While it can be intricate, it is a valuable method if executed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:19">[09:54:19]</a>. This strategy is somewhat similar to [[income_splitting_strategies | income splitting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:06">[09:56:06]</a>.

## How it Works
When an investment is sold at a loss, that loss can be used to reduce the taxes on gains from other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:05">[10:01:05]</a>. If total losses exceed total gains, the excess losses can be carried forward to future years or even carried back to previous years to potentially secure a tax refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:16">[10:06:16]</a>.

### Example
Consider a scenario where an investor realized a $10,000 gain from selling a stock earlier in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:26">[10:14:26]</a>. To reduce the tax bill, they could sell another stock that is currently down by $6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:28">[10:17:28]</a>. This $6,000 loss would offset part of the $10,000 gain, resulting in taxes only being owed on the remaining $4,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:41">[10:23:41]</a>.

### Superficial Loss Rule
A critical rule to be aware of is the Superficial Loss Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:05">[10:31:05]</a>. If the investor or their spouse buys back the same stock within 30 days of selling it, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will disallow the loss claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:07">[10:33:07]</a>. Instead, the loss is added to the cost basis of the new shares, delaying any tax benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:03">[10:41:03]</a>. This rule applies only in non-registered accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:42">[09:31:42]</a>.

The year 2025 brings significant updates to pension payment schedules that could impact retirement planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The Government of Canada has established a unified payment schedule for the [[canada_pension_plan_2025_updates | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]], [[old_age_security_2025_changes | Old Age Security (OAS)]], and [[guaranteed_income_supplement_2025_updates | Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)]] in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means recipients will receive payments for all three programs on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Unified Payment Schedule

Payment dates for [[canada_pension_plan_2025_updates | CPP]], [[old_age_security_2025_changes | OAS]], and [[guaranteed_income_supplement_2025_updates | GIS]] are typically set for the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a scheduled payment date falls on a weekend or a holiday, the funds will be disbursed a little earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### Pro Tip: Direct Deposit

For enhanced convenience and reliability, it is recommended to set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This ensures that payments are deposited into your account on time and is a safer alternative to waiting for a mailed check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

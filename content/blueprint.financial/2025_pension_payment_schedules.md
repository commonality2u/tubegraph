The year 2025 brings updates to [[pension_and_retiree_tax_changes_including_cpp_and_oas | pension]] plans that could significantly impact [[retirement_income_planning_and_cpp | retirement plans]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This includes changes to payment schedules for the [[Canadian Pension Plan payment options | Canada Pension Plan (CPP)]], Old Age Security (OAS), and Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Unified Payment Schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>

For 2025, the Government of Canada has set a unified payment schedule for CPP, OAS, and GIS, ensuring recipients receive payments for all three on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These dates are generally in the last week of each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. If a payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, the payment will be issued earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Direct Deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>
> For convenience and reliability, it is recommended to set up direct deposit through your My Service Canada account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This ensures timely delivery of funds and is a safer alternative to mail checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Canada Pension Plan (CPP) Updates for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>

### [[cpp_cost_of_living_increase_in_2025 | Cost of Living Adjustment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
CPP payments are adjusted annually to keep pace with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For 2025, the adjustment is 2.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This means a monthly CPP payment of $1,000 in 2024 would increase by $26 to $1,026 in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This adjustment helps retirees maintain their purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Two-Tier CPP System (CPP Enhancement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
The two-tier CPP system, also known as CPP enhancement, means higher earners will contribute more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

*   **First Tier (BCPP)**: Applies to earnings up to $71,500, known as the Yearly Maximum Pensionable Earnings (YMPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Employee contribution: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Employer contribution: 5.95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   Self-employed contribution: 11.9% (combined employee and employer rate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Second Tier (CPP2) / [[cpp_postretirement_benefit | Enhanced CPP]]**: Applies to earnings between $71,300 and $81,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Employee contribution: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Employer contribution: 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   Self-employed contribution: 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Contributions are capped at $4,420 for incomes over $81,200 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The first $3,500 of earnings is exempt from calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. For example, an employee earning $40,000 would pay $2,171 in CPP (not reaching the second tier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. An employee earning $80,000 would pay a total of $4,388, which includes the second tier of CPP2 at $348 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. At $100,000 of income, the maximum CPP contribution is capped at $4,420 for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

> [!info] Impact of CPP Enhancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
> This new system helps higher earners save more for retirement, with CPP replacing up to 33.33% of lifetime earnings, an increase from the previous 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This means greater payouts later for higher contributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Old Age Security (OAS) Updates for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>

### Cost of Living Adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
OAS payments are reviewed quarterly to adjust for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. For the January to March 2025 period, there will be no increase due to a small dip in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, over the past year, benefits have grown by 2%, helping seniors keep pace with rising living costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### OAS Clawback Threshold Update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
The OAS pension recovery tax, or "clawback," requires higher-income seniors to repay a portion or all of their OAS benefits if their net income exceeds a specified threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. For the period from July 2024 to June 2025, this threshold is set at $90,997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Seniors with net income exceeding this amount must repay 15% of the excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

> [!example] Clawback Calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>
> If your net income is $100,000, the repayment would be 15% of the difference ($100,000 - $90,997), equaling approximately $1,350 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

> [!tip] Minimizing Clawback Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>
> Strategies like [[pension_income_splitting_for_retirees | income splitting]] or utilizing a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) can help keep net income below the threshold to minimize the clawback's impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Increased OAS Pension at Age 75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>
Seniors aged 75 and older receive a 10% increase in their OAS payments, a measure introduced in July 2022 to address financial challenges faced by older seniors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   For January to March 2025, the maximum monthly OAS payment for individuals aged 65 to 74 is $727 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   For those aged 75 or older, the maximum monthly payment increases to $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) Updates for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>

The GIS provides financial assistance to lower-income seniors in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Keeping Up with Cost of Living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
GIS payments are adjusted quarterly to match changes in the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. For January to March 2025, the maximum monthly GIS payment for a single senior remains at $1,086, as there was no CPI increase over the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. However, GIS benefits have grown by 2% over the past year (January 2024 to January 2025), helping seniors keep pace with rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Updated Income Thresholds for GIS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
GIS qualification depends on income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For the first quarter of 2025, the annual income limit for a single person is $22,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

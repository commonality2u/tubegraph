In Canada, understanding the distribution of [[household_net_worth_in_canada | household net worth]] by class can provide insight into financial realities across the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Statistics Canada provides detailed data, grouping households into five general categories: Lower Class, Lower Middle Class, Middle Class, Upper Middle Class, and Upper Class (the top 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Why Net Worth is More Important Than Income

While many focus on income as a key financial indicator, [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] is what truly determines financial freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. [[household_net_worth_in_canada | Net worth]] is defined as the total value of assets (cash, investments, property) minus liabilities (debts like mortgages, loans, and credit cards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Someone earning a high income but spending it all may be worse off in the long run than someone earning less but investing wisely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Tracking your [[household_net_worth_in_canada | net worth]] helps in making smarter financial decisions and tracking long-term growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A free [[comparison_of_net_worth_tracking_tools_for_canadians | net worth tracker]] can help assess financial position and create a wealth-building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Global Perspective on Wealth

For those in lower wealth classes who feel discouraged, it helps to consider a global perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. A single person earning $30,000 in Canada is considered in the high-income group worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This income translates to about $56 per day in purchasing power parity dollars, significantly higher than most of the global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Many globally live on just a few dollars a day with limited access to essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While this perspective doesn't erase financial struggles, it can help reframe challenges and motivate smarter financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

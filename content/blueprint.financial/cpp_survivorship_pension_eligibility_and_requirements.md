The Canada Pension Plan (CPP) does not always cease upon death; a [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] can be provided to the deceased's eligible spouse or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This pension can amount to up to $818 per month for survivors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Eligibility for the CPP Survivorship Pension

To qualify for the CPP survivorship pension, specific requirements must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>:

*   **Relationship Status**
    The applicant must be the legal spouse or common-law partner of the deceased CPP contributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **CPP Contributions**
    The deceased individual must have contributed to the CPP for at least three of the last six years before their passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, or they must have contributed for a minimum of 10 years in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP] Apply as Soon as Possible
> It is crucial to apply for the [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] promptly after your partner's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Retroactive payments are limited to 12 months, meaning any delay beyond this period could result in lost payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For example, if Emma was eligible for $700 a month and waited 18 months to apply after John's death, she would miss out on 6 months of payments, totaling $4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Survivorship Pension Payment Calculation

The amount of CPP [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] received depends on two primary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:
1.  The survivor's age at the time of the spouse's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
2.  The amount the deceased spouse contributed to the CPP over their working years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The pension is always calculated as if the deceased had reached age 65 at the time of their death, regardless of their actual age at passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Scenarios for Survivors

*   **Survivor Under 65 Years Old**
    A survivor under 65 receives a flat rate amount, which for 2024 is $227, plus 37.5% of the deceased's calculated CPP retirement pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For instance, if John's calculated CPP retirement pension at age 65 was $1,200 per month, Emma (under 65) would receive 37.5% of $1,200 ($450) plus the $227 flat rate, for a total of $677 per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

*   **Survivor 65 Years Old or Older**
    Once the survivor turns 65, their [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] is recalculated to up to 60% of the deceased's calculated pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. If John's CPP retirement pension was $1,200 per month, Emma (65 or older) would receive 60% of $1,200, which is $720 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Average and Maximum Payments

Based on real-life data:
*   For survivors under 65, the average payment is $524 a month, with a maximum of $739 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   For survivors 65 or older, the average payment is $323 per month, with a maximum of $818 a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   The maximum payout is typically achieved only if the deceased spouse contributed the maximum allowable amounts to the CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## [[maximum_limits_and_how_personal_cpp_benefits_affect_survivorship_pension | Maximum Limits and How Personal CPP Benefits Affect Survivorship Pension]]

There is a cap on the total CPP benefits an individual can receive if they are also collecting their own CPP retirement or disability pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The combined amount of the survivor's personal CPP benefits and the [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] cannot exceed the maximum CPP retirement or disability benefit amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

*   **Example: Retirement Pension and Survivorship Pension**
    If Emma receives $800 a month from her CPP retirement pension and qualifies for $700 per month from John's [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]], her combined total would be $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. However, due to the 2024 retirement cap of $1,375, her total benefits would be reduced to that cap amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. If her combined total is below the cap, she would receive the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

*   **Example: Disability Pension Combined with Survivorship Pension**
    If Emma receives $1,200 per month from CPP disability benefits and qualifies for $500 a month from John's [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]], her combined total would be $1,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Due to the combined survivor and disability pension cap at $1,613 per month, her total benefits would be adjusted to that cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Advanced Planning Strategies Around the CPP Cap

*   **Start CPP Early if Below the Cap**
    If your personal CPP retirement pension will be significantly below the maximum, starting it early might be a good option. This allows you to collect both your CPP and the [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] sooner without hitting the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For example, if your CPP is $400/month and survivorship pension is $500/month, the combined $900 is well below the $1,375 cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

*   **Delay CPP if Near the Cap**
    If your expected CPP is close to the maximum, delaying your personal CPP can maximize your overall benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This strategy ensures you receive a higher [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] without exceeding the cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For instance, if your CPP at 65 is $1,000/month and your survivorship pension is $600, the combined $1,600 already exceeds the $1,375 cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Delaying your personal CPP to age 70 could increase its value later, while you still receive the full [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] from age 65 to 69 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Duration of Survivorship Pension Payments

The CPP [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] is received for life, as long as the survivor is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

*   **Remarriage or New Common-Law Relationship**
    Remarrying or entering a new common-law relationship does not affect eligibility; the pension will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Death of the Survivor**
    Payments will stop upon the death of the survivor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## How to Apply for the Survivorship Pension

Applying for the [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]] is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Applicants need to complete the application on the Government of Canada's website and provide supporting documents, such as the spouse's death certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Remember to apply as soon as possible to avoid missing out on payments, due to the 12-month retroactive window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Related Benefits

### [[cpp_child_benefits_and_eligibility | CPP Child Benefits]]

If the deceased contributed to CPP and has eligible children, those children may qualify for the CPP children's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit is available to both biological and adopted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In 2024, the [[cpp_child_benefits_and_eligibility | CPP child benefit]] offers a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

**Eligibility:**
*   The child must be under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Or, between 18 and 25 years old and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The application process is similar to the [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship benefit]], requiring supporting documents like proof of school enrollment for children between 18 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | CPP Death Benefit]]

The [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | CPP death benefit]] is a one-time lump sum payment, typically $2,500, paid to the estate of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In some cases, it may be as much as $5,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This amount can help cover immediate expenses, such as funeral costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Taxability of CPP Benefits

All mentioned CPP benefits, including the [[survivorship_pension_payment_amounts_and_factors | survivorship pension]], [[cpp_child_benefits_and_eligibility | child benefit]], and [[cpp_death_benefits_and_their_implications | death benefit]], are taxable and must be reported on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

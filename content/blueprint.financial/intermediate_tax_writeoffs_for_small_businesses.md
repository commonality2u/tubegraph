Intermediate level tax write-offs require more involvement than simple deductions but can lead to significant savings for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Hiring a Family Member
You can deduct salaries paid to family members if the salary is reasonable and reflects the work performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:03">[06:18:03]</a>. To avoid issues with the CRA, treat the employment of family members like any other employee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:07">[06:26:07]</a>. This strategy helps manage your business effectively and keeps funds within the family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:07">[06:31:07]</a>.

For example, if you hire your son to manage social media accounts for $20 an hour, working 20 hours a week, this totals $20,800 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. This entire amount is a deductible business expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:09">[06:51:09]</a>. If your business's taxable income is $100,000, deducting your son's salary reduces your taxable income to $79,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:02">[06:54:02]</a>.

## Equipment Depreciation (Capital Cost Allowance - CCA)
When you purchase assets like computers, machinery, or furniture for your business, you cannot deduct the full cost in the year of purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Instead, you depreciate the cost over several years, which is known as Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:03">[07:16:03]</a>. The CRA has specific classes for different asset types, each with its own rate of depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

For instance:
*   Computers fall under Class 50 with a 55% depreciation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.
*   Furniture falls under Class 8 with a 20% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

Applying the correct class and rate is crucial for accurate deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. For example, if you buy a computer for $2,000, you can claim 55% of $2,000, or $1,100, in the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The remaining balance can be depreciated in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

## Interest on Business Loans
Interest payments on loans taken out to finance business operations are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This applies to various loan types, including lines of credit, term loans, and even certain credit card interest if the expenses are business-related <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. It's important to differentiate business loan interest from personal loan interest, as only interest on loans specifically used for business purposes can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. For example, interest paid on a loan used to purchase new equipment for your business can be deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

## Commercial Insurance Premiums
Premiums paid for insurance on your business assets, such as property, equipment, and inventory, are deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. This includes policies that cover losses from fire, theft, and other damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. For instance, if you insure your office building and equipment, the premiums paid can be deducted from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

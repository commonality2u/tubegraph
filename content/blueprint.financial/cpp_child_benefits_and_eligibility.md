If you have children, they may be eligible for the [[childrelated_tax_benefits_and_deductions | CPP children's benefit]], which provides financial support after the loss of a contributing parent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This benefit is available to both biological and adopted children of the deceased and can significantly help, especially with education expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Benefit Amount

For 2024, the CPP child benefit offers a flat rate payment of $294 per month per child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. This amount is not based on the earnings of the surviving parent or the deceased spouse; it is a set amount designed to ease the financial burden for families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Eligibility Requirements

To qualify for the CPP child benefit, the child must meet specific criteria:
*   Be under 18 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Or, be between 18 and 25 years old and enrolled in full-time school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

The benefit stops once the child reaches 25 years of age or is no longer attending school full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## How to Apply

The application process for the CPP child benefit is straightforward and similar to applying for the [[cpp_survivorship_pension_eligibility_and_requirements | CPP survivorship pension]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. You can apply through Service Canada and will need supporting documents, such as your child's proof of enrollment in school if they are between 18 and 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Taxability of Benefits

All CPP benefits, including the child benefit, are taxable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. You must report these benefits on your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Understanding [[tax_implications_of_cpp_benefits | how these benefits work]] and their tax implications can be challenging, especially during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

A significant regret among Canadians who contribute to Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) is underestimating the automatic [[tax_implications_of_rrsp_withdrawals | withholding tax]] on [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Many mistakenly believe they will only owe tax at filing time, not realizing a portion is deducted upfront, leading to less cash than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## How Withholding Tax Works

The amount of withholding tax deducted depends on the size of the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

### Examples

*   **Jeff's Emergency Expense:** Jeff withdrew $10,000 for an emergency. His bank withheld 20%, meaning he initially received only $8,000, with $2,000 going directly to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. However, because his marginal tax rate was higher than 20%, he had to pay an additional $1,000 in taxes when he filed his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Maria's Vacation:** Maria, a retiree, withdrew $25,000 for a vacation. Her bank automatically withheld 30%, leaving her with $17,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. At tax time, her actual income rate was even higher than 30%, forcing her to pay another $2,500 beyond what was already deducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Common Misconception

Many individuals regret assuming that the initial withholding tax was the final amount owed, only to be unpleasantly surprised when filing their taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This often makes early [[inflexibility_and_tax_consequences_of_rrsp_withdrawals | RRSP withdrawals]] less appealing than they initially seemed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Planning Ahead

Before contributing to an RRSP, it is crucial to consider whether the money might be needed before retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. If the answer is "yes" or "maybe," a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) or another type of account might be a more suitable choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. However, if an RRSP is used strategically for long-term retirement savings, it can be a powerful tool, provided proper planning ensures it works for the individual and not against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

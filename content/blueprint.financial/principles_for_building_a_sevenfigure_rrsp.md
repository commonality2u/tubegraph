From: [[blueprint.financial]] <br/> 

Many Canadians have successfully built seven-figure Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs) not by being the highest earners or "stock-picking geniuses," but by adhering to a specific set of principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These individuals share common secrets and avoid a major mistake that often hinders others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Secret #1: Make RRSP Contributions Hurt (In a Good Way)
RRSP millionaires don't simply contribute what feels comfortable; they push themselves to save more, even if it feels difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Unlike most people who save whatever is left after expenses, RRSP millionaires prioritize paying their RRSP first, before rent, bills, or anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. They understand that without forcing themselves to save, it often won't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### How RSP Millionaires Do It
*   **Force Scarcity Trick** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>: They increase RRSP contributions every time they receive a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For example, a 5% raise might prompt them to bump up contributions by 2-3%, meaning they never really feel or miss the extra money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Treat Savings Like Essential Payments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>: They view RRSP savings as non-optional, similar to rent or mortgage payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Round Up Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>: If planning to save $500 a month, they'll aim for $550 or $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This seemingly small stretch accumulates significantly over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Avoid Lifestyle Creep** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>: Instead of upgrading their lifestyle with every raise, they prioritize upgrading their savings first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Finding the Right Balance
Similar to physical training, there's a balance between saving too intensely and not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Pushing too hard can lead to burnout or injury, while not pushing enough results in minimal progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The key is to find a "sweet spot" where you challenge yourself without becoming miserable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. If saving causes stress, isolation, or prevents you from enjoying valued activities, you might be "overtraining" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Why This Works
Consider Jennifer, who saves whatever is left each month, often resulting in $0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. In contrast, John consistently contributes at least $600 monthly and increases his contributions with every raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. After 30 years, John retires with hundreds of thousands more than Jennifer, solely due to his consistent and disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Secret #2: RRSP Millionaires are [[stoic_investing_approach_for_rrsp_millionaires | Stoic Investors]]
[[stoic_investing_approach_for_rrsp_millionaires | Stoicism]], an ancient philosophy, teaches the importance of controlling what's within one's power and ignoring what isn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This mindset is transformative in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Many investors are swayed by emotions, reacting impulsively to market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. RRSP millionaires, however, adopt a [[stoic_investing_approach_for_rrsp_millionaires | stoic approach]], adhering to a rules-based system irrespective of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### What Stoic Investors Do Differently
*   **Ignore Market Noise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>: They recognize that short-term market movements are irrelevant to their long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. They stay focused on their plan, uninfluenced by fear or greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Don't Get Caught in Hype or Panic** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>: Unlike average investors who chase hot stocks or panic sell during downturns, RRSP millionaires maintain composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. They trust their strategy, understanding that sticking to the plan outperforms emotional decisions in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Accept Volatility as Part of the Game** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>: They understand that market fluctuations are natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Instead of panicking during downturns, they view them as buying opportunities, confident that markets will recover and grow over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Why This Works
Josh, an emotional investor, constantly checks his portfolio and reacts to market changes, often selling low and buying high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. His returns suffer due to emotional decisions and added trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Ashley, a [[stoic_investing_approach_for_rrsp_millionaires | stoic investor]], invests consistently without reacting to day-to-day market news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. After 30 years, Ashley is significantly wealthier, not from brilliant stock picks, but from remaining calm and adhering to her plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Secret #3: RRSP Millionaires Trick Their Future Selves Into Being Rich
Building wealth doesn't always require immense discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. RRSP millionaires employ automation to save effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### The Secret to Effortless Saving
*   **Set Up Pre-Authorized Contributions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>: Contributions occur automatically on payday, preventing opportunities to spend the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Automatically Increase Contributions Annually** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>: They set up an automatic 1% increase each year, allowing savings to grow without conscious effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Reinvest Their RRSP Tax Refund** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>: Instead of spending refunds on vacations or gadgets, they reinvest them, adding tens or hundreds of thousands to their portfolios over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Take Full Advantage of Free Money** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>:
    *   **Employer RRSP Matching** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>: They never leave matching contributions on the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   **Spousal RRSPs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>: Used to balance taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Deduction Carry Forwards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>: Claimed when they offer the most tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Why This Works
James manually transfers money to his RRSP, often forgetting or needing the money for other things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Sophie, on the other hand, automates all her RRSP contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. By retirement, Sophie is far wealthier, not due to higher earnings, but because she eliminated human error from the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Major Mistake: Not Knowing the RRSP Exit Strategy Before Entering
A common and costly mistake made even by RRSP millionaires is focusing solely on growing their RRSP without planning how to withdraw it tax-efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Without a strategy, they risk paying excessive taxes in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### The Problem
RRSPs are tax-deferred, not tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While contributions reduce taxable income today, every dollar withdrawn is taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Without a plan, this can lead to withdrawing large sums at high tax rates or leaving heirs with a substantial tax bill upon death, as the RRSP is fully taxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Solutions and Approaches
*   **[[RRSP withdrawal strategies | Starting early withdrawals]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>: To spread taxable income and avoid tax spikes when Registered Retirement Income Fund (RRIF) withdrawals begin after age 71 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **[[RSP to TFSA conversion strategy | Shifting funds into a TFSA]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>: To keep investments growing tax-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **[[Strategies to minimize RRSP tax burden in retirement | Coordinating RRSP withdrawals]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>: With other income sources like Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Old Age Security (OAS) to avoid higher tax brackets and the OAS clawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **[[Estate planning with RRSPs | Estate Planning]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>: Utilizing tools like life insurance policies to offset the tax burden, ensuring more wealth remains with your family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

Most retirees unknowingly lose tens of thousands of dollars in taxes simply by not planning their RRSP withdrawals effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) imposes penalties on individuals who contribute to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) while no longer considered a Canadian resident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:08">[05:07:08]</a>. This is considered a form of [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | TFSA overcontribution]].

## Rules for Non-Residents
When an individual moves abroad and ceases to be a Canadian resident, they are no longer permitted to contribute to their TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.

## Penalties
Contributing to a TFSA while living outside Canada incurs a 1% penalty per month on every dollar contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:02">[05:19:02]</a>.

### Case Example: Jessica
Jessica moved to the United States for a job but continued to contribute $6,000 to her TFSA, unaware of the rules for non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:05">[05:25:05]</a>. The CRA charged her a 1% monthly penalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. Because she was not in Canada, she did not discover the mistake for several years, which led to thousands of dollars in penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:04">[05:37:04]</a>.

## Common Overcontribution Pitfalls (Related)
While not exclusive to non-residents, some common pitfalls related to [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties_and_technical_pitfalls | TFSA overcontribution penalties and technical pitfalls]] can impact anyone, including those in transition:

*   **Trusting CRA's Online Contribution Limits**
    The CRA's online records may not always be up-to-date, so relying solely on their figures can lead to accidental [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | overcontribution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:09">[05:55:09]</a>. It is recommended to maintain personal records, such as a spreadsheet or notes, to track contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:03">[06:01:03]</a>.
*   **Recontributing in the Same Year**
    Withdrawing funds from a TFSA does not immediately restore contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Contribution room from withdrawals resets only in the following calendar year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Recontributing too soon will incur penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. It's advisable to wait until January 1 of the next year to recontribute, especially if the withdrawal occurred late in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.
*   **Not Transferring Investments "In Kind"**
    When moving investments between accounts, selling them first and then redepositing the cash into a TFSA can lead to [[avoiding_tfsa_overcontribution_penalties | overcontribution problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Instead, transfer investments "in kind" without selling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Care should still be taken with timing to avoid potentially reducing contribution room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

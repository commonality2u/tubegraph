## Big Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Investing Only in a Savings Account

Investing only in a savings account is a common mistake for TFSA holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Scenario**: Starting with $95,000 in a TFSA, contributing $7,000 annually, and earning a low 2% interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: It would take 56 years to reach $1 million, with total contributions of $487,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Starting at age 25, one would be 81 by the time the goal is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   **Prevalence**: A recent survey indicates that 47% of Canadian TFSA holders have only cash and savings in their accounts, meaning many may never reach a million-dollar goal even if they max out their TFSAs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This represents a [[lack_of_clear_tfsa_strategy | lack of clear TFSA strategy]] for many.

### Mistake #2: Taking on Way Too Much Risk

The opposite extreme involves taking on excessive risk, such as betting on very high-risk crypto coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Scenario**: Starting with $95,000 and doubling money for a 100% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: While theoretically reaching $1 million in 3 to 4 years with $120,000 invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, this is a terrible strategy for most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The vast majority will not achieve such returns, and the chances of losing everything are extremely high, making the strategy worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Warren Buffett's Philosophy**: "Rule number one: Never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one" emphasizes avoiding losses over spectacular gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Realistic Strategies for Growth

The key to building a million-dollar TFSA is to find a middle ground that balances risk and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. [[strategies_for_maximizing_tfsa_growth | Strategies for maximizing TFSA growth]] involve careful consideration of risk tolerance and investment selection.

### Understanding Risk Tolerance

First, assess your risk tolerance using a free online questionnaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Then, select the right [[investment_options_for_a_tfsa | investments]] to reach your goal within a reasonable timeframe and contribute regularly to your TFSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Example 1: Investing 100% in Equities (High Risk Tolerance)

For those with a high risk tolerance, investing 100% in stocks or equities can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Assumptions**: Starting with $95,000, contributing $7,000 annually, and achieving an average return of 7% (based on a conservative estimate from the Canadian stock market's 20-year return of 7.8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: It would take 25 years to reach $1 million, with total contributions of $270,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This strategy allows someone starting at age 40 to reach the goal by age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Example 2: Investing 50% Equities / 50% Bonds (Medium Risk Tolerance)

For a medium risk tolerance, a balanced approach with 50% equities and 50% bonds is viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Assumptions**: Combining equities (7% assumed) with bonds (2-3% historical return) for an overall 4.5% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Starting with $95,000 and contributing $7,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: It would take approximately 35 years to reach $1 million, with total contributions of $340,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This strategy requires starting at age 30 to reach the goal by age 65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This is a medium-risk strategy attainable by most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

These examples demonstrate how the time to reach $1 million in a TFSA depends on your risk and return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The "sweet spot" is to achieve sufficient returns without risking significant capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Investment Options for Your TFSA

Here are [[investment_options_for_growing_a_tfsa | five investment options]] to consider for your TFSA to help you reach your million-dollar goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### 1. Avoiding Mutual Funds at Big Banks

While convenient, mutual funds at big banks often come with very high fees, sometimes topping 3% annually, which significantly reduces investment gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### 2. Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)

ETFs are an excellent choice for keeping costs down, as they mirror market index performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Providers like Vanguard and iShares offer ETFs with very low fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, ETFs expose you to market volatility and require basic trading knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### 3. Individual Stocks

Investing in individual stocks provides ultimate control and the lowest fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. A dividend stock strategy can offer capital appreciation and regular income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This option requires significant market knowledge and time for portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Greater control often comes with increased risk, especially if not diversified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

### 4. Robo-Advisors

Robo-advisors are automated platforms that manage investments through algorithms, aligning with personal financial goals and risk tolerance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Popular Canadian options include Wealthsimple and Questwealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Pros**: Convenience, simplicity, ideal for new investors or those preferring a hands-off approach, and can be started with small amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Cons**: Lack the personal touch and deeper understanding of a human advisor, may not fully capture unique investment opportunities, or tailor strategies for changing financial circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### 5. Portfolio Managers

Hiring a portfolio manager offers a personal touch and expertise for those who find managing investments overwhelming or prefer not to rely on algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Traditionally for the wealthy, this option is now more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. A professional manager can tailor your portfolio to specific needs and risk tolerance, optimizing for success without daily effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Tax-Efficient TFSA Withdrawal Strategies for Retirement

Once your TFSA reaches $1 million, strategic withdrawal is crucial for [[taxfree_savings_account_tfsa_and_withdrawal_strategies | maximizing tax savings]] in retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Should You Withdraw From Your TFSA or RRSP First?

The decision to withdraw from your TFSA or RRSP first is not one-size-fits-all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **RRSP First**: Withdrawing from your RRSP first can be beneficial because it's taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Drawing down your RRSP earlier may reduce your overall tax burden later, especially to avoid Old Age Security (OAS) clawbacks based on income level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **TFSA Later**: Withdrawals from a TFSA are not taxable, allowing investments to continue growing tax-free and providing a tax-efficient source of funds that doesn't impact OAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Bucket Strategy for a $1 Million TFSA

A "bucket strategy" can help manage a substantial TFSA in retirement to ensure it lasts and grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Funds**: Keep in safer investments like bonds or GICs for immediate expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **Medium-Term Funds**: Invest in balanced funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Funds**: Keep in equities to ensure growth against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
This approach ensures funds are available when needed while still working for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Managing TFSA with CPP (Canada Pension Plan)

A strategic approach can optimize your TFSA with your CPP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   Use your TFSA to supplement CPP amounts during years of lower other income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   Consider delaying CPP withdrawals while drawing from your TFSA if you retire early and need funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This allows government benefits to grow, maximizing later retirement income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Achieving a million-dollar TFSA requires a simple, smart strategy and proper risk-return management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The more challenging aspect is often figuring out the optimal tax strategy for your TFSA once it's built up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. For help with investment strategies or tax-efficient withdrawals, financial planning services can provide assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

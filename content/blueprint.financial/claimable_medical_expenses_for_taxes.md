Navigating healthcare costs in Canada can be challenging, even with the country's public healthcare system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Fortunately, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) allows individuals to claim some out-of-pocket medical expenses on their tax returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide outlines common medical expenses you can claim and how to maximize your tax refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## How Medical Expense Claims Work in Canada

The Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) allows Canadians to claim eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. To claim, these expenses must be entered on specific lines of your tax return:
*   Line 33099: For expenses related to yourself, your spouse or common-law partner, or children under 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Line 33199: For expenses related to other dependents, such as adult children, parents, grandparents, or siblings who rely on you for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Calculating Eligible Medical Expense Claims

You can only claim the portion of expenses not reimbursed by insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. From your total eligible expenses, you must subtract the *lower* of 3% of your net income or a set threshold amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For 2024 expenses, this threshold is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Jessica earns $50,000 and had $2,500 in medical expenses in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
> *   3% of her net income ($50,000) is $1,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,500 = $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
> Jessica can claim $1,000 as a non-refundable tax credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Common Claimable Medical Expenses

### Prescribed Drugs and Medications

You can claim eligible prescription drugs and medications as medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. These must be prescribed by a licensed medical professional and dispensed by a pharmacist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Medical marijuana is covered, but requires a valid medical document from a healthcare provider and must be purchased from a licensed producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Sarah earns $60,000 annually and spent $3,000 on prescribed medications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($60,000) is $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $3,000 - $1,800 = $1,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
> Sarah can claim $1,200 in medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
>
> [!TIP]
> Keep track of your pharmacy receipts and prescriptions to maximize your claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Dental and Vision Care

Many dental and vision care costs are tax-deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. You can claim expenses for services provided by licensed professionals such as dentists, orthodontists, optometrists, and ophthalmologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Covered expenses include:
*   Routine checkups, fillings, root canals, gum surgery, braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Prescription eyewear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
Purely cosmetic procedures like teeth whitening and non-prescription sunglasses do not qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Alex, a high earner at $150,000 per year, spent $3,100 on dental work ($2,500) and new prescription glasses ($600) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
> *   3% of his income ($150,000) is $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
> *   The 2024 threshold is $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
> *   Since $2,759 is lower than $4,500, Alex subtracts $2,759 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,100 - $2,759 = $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
> Alex can claim $341 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> Higher-income earners often need larger medical expenses to qualify for a claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Consider timing major procedures within the same 12-month period (e.g., laser eye surgery and a root canal) to maximize deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### [[travel_expenses_for_medical_care | Medical Travel Expenses]]

If you need to travel for medical care, you may be able to claim travel costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This applies if you travel at least 40 km one way to access medical services not available near your home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. If you travel over 80 km, you can also claim meals and accommodations in addition to transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Eligible travel expenses include:
*   **Public transportation**: Bus, train, taxi, flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Vehicle expenses**: Fuel, parking, maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Lodging**: Hotel, Airbnb, if required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Meals**: When required for an extended stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Jennifer earns $55,000 and traveled 100 km round trip weekly for medical treatments over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. She spent $800 on gas and parking, and $1,500 on meals and accommodations, for a total of $2,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($55,000) is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,300 - $1,650 = $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
> Jennifer can claim $650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
>
> [!PRO TIP]
> If a medical practitioner certifies that you need assistance while traveling, you can also claim the travel cost for an accompanying person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Keep detailed records including receipts and medical appointment confirmations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### [[private_health_insurance_premiums_deductions | Private Health Insurance Premiums]]

If you pay out-of-pocket for [[private_health_insurance_premiums_deductions | private health insurance]], you may be able to deduct premiums from your taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This includes plans covering medical, dental, vision, prescription drugs, and hospitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   Employer-paid premiums do not qualify unless they are included as taxable income on your T4 slip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Premiums for self-employed individuals can also be claimed, provided they cover eligible expenses and are not reimbursed by an employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Family plans may allow you to claim premiums for your spouse and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Mark earns $90,000 and pays $3,500 annually for [[private_health_insurance_premiums_deductions | private health insurance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
> *   3% of his income ($90,000) is $2,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
> *   His eligible claim is $3,500 - $2,700 = $800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
> Mark can deduct $800 from his taxable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
>
> [!TIP]
> If you have a mix of private and employer-sponsored insurance, check which portion of your premiums is eligible and keep records of your payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Medical Devices and Equipment

Many medical devices and equipment expenses qualify as tax-deductible medical expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. These include:
*   Wheelchairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Hearing aids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   Insulin pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>
*   CPAP machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
*   Prosthetics and orthopedic braces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
*   In some cases, home modifications like wheelchair ramps or stairlifts are also eligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Some medical devices require a doctor's prescription to qualify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. It's essential to keep records of both the prescription and the receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Costs for ongoing maintenance, such as batteries for hearing aids or CPAP filters, may also be deductible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Emily earns $65,000 and bought a CPAP machine for $2,500 for her sleep apnea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
> *   3% of her income ($65,000) is $1,950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
> *   Her eligible claim is $2,500 - $1,950 = $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
> Emily can claim $550 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
>
> [!TIP]
> If you're making a large purchase for medical reasons, ensure it's on the CRA's list of eligible medical devices to confirm it qualifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Maximizing Family Medical Expense Write-offs

For families, properly claiming medical expenses can significantly impact your tax return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The CRA allows you to combine medical costs for your spouse and dependents, but knowing who should claim them can maximize your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> Richard and Pauline are a couple with a 16-year-old daughter, Jen, and a 19-year-old son, Rob <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Their medical expenses were:
> *   Richard: $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
> *   Pauline: $2,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
> *   Jen (16): $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
> *   Rob (19): $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
> Total expenses: $7,600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>

Since Jen is under 18, her expenses ($1,800) are combined with Richard and Pauline's, making $6,300 eligible for line 33099 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Rob's expenses ($1,300) must be claimed separately on line 33199 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Let's calculate the eligible claim for Richard and Pauline on line 33099:
*   **Pauline:** Earns $55,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. 3% of her income is $1,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Her eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,650 = $4,650 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Richard:** Earns $42,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. 3% of his income is $1,260 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. His eligible claim would be $6,300 - $1,260 = $5,040 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Since Richard can get the higher claim ($5,040 vs. $4,650), he should claim the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> [!PRO TIP]
> Always check who in your family has the lowest income, as they may get a bigger deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Organizing receipts and choosing the right person to claim can maximize tax savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

This article summarizes Patrick Collison's perspectives on scientific research, the functioning of traditional institutions like the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the potential of alternative models like Fast Grants and the Arc Institute, as discussed in a podcast episode.

## Critiques of Current Research Funding and Structures

Collison raises several points regarding the prevailing models for funding and conducting scientific research, particularly in the biomedical field.

### The Limitations of Funding as a Primary Metric
Collison expresses skepticism about focusing heavily on overall funding levels (e.g., the NIH budget) as the primary indicator of R&D output and effectiveness [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | economic and societal impacts of AI progress]]. He references a concept termed "moneyism" by Noah Smith, which describes the presumption of a direct and constant relationship between financial investment and outcomes. He notes that despite a significant increase (two orders of magnitude) in the number of practicing scientists and associated spending in the US post-World War II compared to pre-World War II, it's not clear that scientific output has scaled linearly [[historical_analysis_of_world_war_i_and_world_war_ii | historical analysis of World War I and World War II]]. This suggests that factors beyond mere funding levels are crucial.

### Homogeneity and Rigidity in Biomedical Research
A significant concern is the homogeneity in how biomedical science is currently pursued. The dominant structure involves:
*   Basic research conducted in academic settings.
*   Principal Investigators (PIs) running labs and primarily applying to the NIH for project-based grants.
*   Grant review by committees ("study sections") with often rigid scoring criteria.
Collison argues that such homogeneity can be detrimental in ecosystems aiming for "tail outcomes" or breakthrough discoveries [[scientific_and_technological_developments_in_ai | scientific and technological developments in AI]]. He also notes the historical rejection of NIH applications for eventually groundbreaking work by figures like Jennifer Doudna (CRISPR) and Katalin Karik√≥ (mRNA vaccines) as potential indicators that speculative, high-impact research might be filtered out by current systems.

### Impact on Researcher Autonomy
The structure of grant funding can significantly constrain researchers. A survey conducted with Fast Grants recipients indicated that 79% (four out of five) stated their research agenda would change "a lot" if they had flexible funding, as opposed to project-specific grants. This suggests that researchers might pursue different, potentially more impactful, directions if given more autonomy [[the_role_of_applied_mathematicians_and_their_impact_on_various_fields | the role of applied mathematicians and their impact on various fields]].

## Alternative Models and Approaches

Collison discusses several initiatives and concepts that offer different ways to organize and fund scientific research.

### Fast Grants
Fast Grants was an initiative co-founded by Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen, and Silvana Collison, emerging during the COVID-19 pandemic to rapidly fund relevant research.
*   **Key Learning:** The program highlighted the significant impact of providing researchers with flexible, quickly-disbursed funding.
*   **Institutional Response:** To Collison's knowledge, traditional funding institutions like the NIH or NSF have not undertaken significant retrospectives or protocol changes based on the Fast Grants experience. He comments that large organizations often struggle with self-reflection.

### Arc Institute
The Arc Institute, a biomedical research organization co-founded by Collison, was established to explore alternative research models. Its differentiating features include:
1.  **Scientist-Driven Funding:** Arc funds scientists directly to pursue curiosity-driven research, rather than funding specific projects.
2.  **In-House Infrastructure:** It builds and provides shared technological platforms and capabilities, reducing the need for individual labs to develop these independently.
3.  **Alternative Career Paths:** Arc aims to provide career paths for scientists who excel at research but may not wish to become PIs, a role that typically involves significant managerial and grant-writing overhead [[economic_and_strategic_implications_of_energy_resources | economic and strategic implications of energy resources]]. An example of this model's success is the development of "bridge editing" technology, led by a senior scientist at Arc.

### Advanced Market Commitments (AMCs)
Collison sees potential for AMCs in stimulating innovation, particularly in areas where traditional patent incentives are weak. Frontier, an AMC for carbon removal, serves as a model [[economic_growth_and_technological_development | economic growth and technological development]].
*   **Biomedical Applications:** He suggests AMCs could be useful for unpatentable but potentially beneficial treatments (e.g., mannose for cancer) or for vaccines for diseases with insufficient market incentives (e.g., Lyme disease).

## The Importance of Research Environment and Culture

Beyond funding mechanisms, Collison emphasizes the role of the research environment.

### Learning and Standards
For fields like biology, acquiring deep "bench skills" and specific factual knowledge is paramount. Direct experience in top labs is often irreplaceable for learning practical techniques, problem selection, and understanding high standards [[cultural_transmission_knowledge_accumulation_and_social_learning | cultural transmission, knowledge accumulation, and social learning]].

### Organizational Culture
The example of Gerty and Carl Cori's lab at Washington University in St. Louis, which produced six Nobel laureates from its students, points to the profound impact of organizational structures and cultural practices. Collison suggests that such effective environments are, in principle, more replicable than relying on finding rare, exceptionally brilliant individuals [[impact_of_culture_and_environment_on_intelligence | impact of culture and environment on intelligence]].

## Broader Challenges in Scientific Advancement

Collison touches upon systemic issues affecting scientific progress:
*   **Diminishing Returns:** There's a perception that impactful ideas are becoming harder to find, with slowdowns observed across various sectors.
*   **Productive Capacity:** He speculates that an increase in "unproductive capacity" (whether in terms of personnel, processes, or organizations) could explain some observed diminishing returns, rather than an inherent exhaustion of discoverable ideas. This points to potential structural, cultural, or organizational inefficiencies. He contrasts the R&D approaches and efficacy of organizations like SpaceX and NASA as an example.

In conclusion, Collison's remarks suggest that while funding is necessary, significant improvements in scientific research productivity may come from diversifying institutional models, fostering researcher autonomy, and paying closer attention to the cultural and organizational environments in which science is conducted [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | the evolution and future of the tech industry]].

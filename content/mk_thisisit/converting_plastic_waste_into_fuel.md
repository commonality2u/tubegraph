Adam Hańderek has developed a technology that converts plastic waste into high-quality fuel suitable for diesel and petrol engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This fuel product has physicochemical parameters that allow it to be poured directly into an engine without problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The price of this fuel is significantly lower than that of fuel produced from crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Technology
The process involves thermolysis or [[pyrolysis_technology_for_recycling | pyrolysis]], a method known since 1941 when polyethylene was first subjected to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. While many companies have worked on similar concepts, Hańderek's developed technology allows for the direct obtainment of high-quality products that do not require additional technological processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This differentiates it from other plastic waste [[pyrolysis_technology_for_recycling | pyrolysis]] processes, which typically produce raw materials needing further refining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The invention holds granted patents in the United States, Canada, and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

### Feedstock Materials
The technology utilizes various types of plastic waste:
*   **Polyethylene** – including plastic bags, bottles for milk, and household chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Polypropylene** – typically found in hard materials like boxes and packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Polystyrene** – specifically polystyrene removed from old buildings insulated 30-40 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Economic and Environmental Impact
Producing fuel from plastic waste is much cheaper than from crude oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This is because plastic waste has already undergone purification processes (desulfurization, dehydration, distillation) similar to those for crude oil, making them clean materials ready for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Poland annually produces about 1.5 million tons of plastic waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. If all plastic waste unsuitable for traditional mechanical recycling could be processed using this method, it could yield 1.5 million cubic meters of fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This volume alone could satisfy at least 5% of Poland's annual demand for fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

New regulations in the European Union, specifically directives RIT 2 and the upcoming RIT 3, equate "coal fuels" produced from plastic waste with biological fuels (like ethanol or biodiesel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This will mandate the use of such components in engine fuels, and this technology could meet half of this future demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This aligns with [[economic_and_ecological_benefits_of_recycling_plastics | economic and ecological benefits of recycling plastics]] and contributes to [[recycling_and_its_effectiveness_in_combating_climate_change | combating climate change]] by reducing reliance on virgin fossil fuels.

## Challenges in Commercialization
Despite the innovative nature and potential, the commercialization of this fuel is an expensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. There is significant interest from Poland and globally, with letters of intent signed for several dozen installations in countries like Vietnam, Korea, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. However, building the first commercial industrial installation to demonstrate scalability is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The project faced setbacks due to dramatic geopolitical changes and the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a significant increase in the costs of materials and engineering services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A budget that was initially 48-50 million PLN increased to almost 75 million PLN, rendering previously secured subsidies from the Polish Agency for Enterprise Development unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. These are common [[challenges_in_commercializing_recycling_technologies | challenges in commercializing recycling technologies]] and exemplify [[economic_potential_and_business_challenges_in_recycling_startups | economic potential and business challenges in recycling startups]].

Currently, an application has been submitted to a European Union accelerator fund, with hopes for investment to build a plant in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Broader Philosophy and Inspiration
The inventor, Adam Hańderek, is not a titular scientist but drew inspiration from his grandparents' self-sufficient farm life, where nothing was wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. He also credits his chemistry teacher, Professor Jerzy Waliczek, who emphasized Einstein's words: "imagination is everything; if you lack imagination, you do not need knowledge because you cannot do anything with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. Hańderek believes that knowledge can sometimes limit imagination, and he strives to think outside conventional schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

His past work included recycling animal stomach contents and technical blood into feed mixtures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. He holds the belief that everything can potentially be reused, even if economically feasible solutions aren't always immediately apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

Poland has an ambitious goal to become one of the top 10 richest countries in the world, aspiring to a "civilizational leap" by the middle of this century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Currently, Poland ranks around 50th in terms of GDP per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>, despite a sevenfold growth in GDP per capita over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. The key resource for this future growth is identified as the nation's intellect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Polish Science and Technology

Despite a high intellectual potential, particularly in programming, Poland faces significant challenges in translating this into broader economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Educational System Shortcomings
A primary challenge identified is the shortcomings of the Polish education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. While Poland excels at identifying and preparing talented individuals for IT Olympiads, winning a large number of medals per capita (only one less than the United States, despite having nine times smaller population), this success is limited to a very small fraction of teachers and students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Out of 18,000 computer science teachers, only about 200 participate in the Olympic program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

A significant issue is the failure to implement basic programming education across all primary schools. Although programming was introduced to the core curriculum six years ago, teachers were not adequately prepared to teach it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### Teacher Remuneration
Low teacher salaries are a major barrier, often forcing teachers to pursue tutoring rather than enhancing their professional qualifications after school hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. For context, a starting teacher in Poland earns 3690 PLN, while a Lidl cashier earns 5000 PLN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>. This discourages the best individuals from entering the teaching profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

## Initiatives for Innovation

### "Programming Our Second Language" Project
To address the educational shortcomings, the "Programming Our Second Language" project has been initiated by Miron Mironiuk and the AiSpace team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. The project aims to ensure all primary school students learn basic programming within four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Programming is considered a fundamental skill of the 21st century, akin to reading, writing, or counting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>.

The project began on September 1st in three communes: Chełm, Syców, and Zduńska Wola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. These communes were chosen to be representative of most Polish municipalities, focusing on areas where children need opportunities most, and deliberately including cities managed by different political parties (Civic Coalition and PiS) to promote cross-party cooperation for national success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

The project involves:
*   **Teacher Training:** Intensive 3-day training for computer science teachers, followed by year-long consulting and support to expand their knowledge gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.
*   **Scholarships and Awards:** All participating teachers receive monthly scholarships, and the top 30% most outstanding teachers receive additional awards based on their commitment and student progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

The project is co-financed by AiSpace and receives educational partnership from InstaCode, founded by Andrzej Samek (the first Pole to win an international IT Olympiad), and Nask, which covers scholarships and awards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. The substantive council includes Professor Krzysztof Diks, a mentor to many Olympic champions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

This initiative is seen as a "once in 120 years" opportunity for Poland, comparable to the Second Industrial Revolution, where new technologies like electricity propelled the United States to global economic leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>.

## Role of Entrepreneurship and Public Engagement

Miron Mironiuk, founder of AiSpace, which provides services to over a billion smartphones globally and is valued at over 2 billion zlotys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, believes in giving back to Poland, feeling a debt to Polish public schools for his upbringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of providing future generations with the same opportunities he had <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. His public activity, including a TikTok account where he shares stories of Polish innovators (like the Warner Bros. founders, Max Factor, and Ikea's former head Anna Pawlak-Kuliga), aims to inspire and promote [[polish_culture_and_technological_innovation | Polish technological thought]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

The initiative highlights a broader focus on societal needs, such as education and healthcare, rather than hypothetical future problems with AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. Public surveys indicate that after the tax system, the education system is the most pressing area for change in Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:00">[29:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.
